Signs and symptoms are the observed or detectable signs, and experienced symptoms of an illness,  injury, or condition.  A sign for example may be a higher or lower temperature than normal,  raised or lowered blood pressure or an abnormality showing on a medical scan .  A  symptom is something out of the ordinary that is experienced by an individual such as feeling feverish, a headache  or other pain or pains in the body. [1] [2]
A medical sign is an objective indication of a disease, injury, or abnormal physiological state that may be detected during a physical examination . [3] These signs are visible or otherwise detectable such as a rash or bruise . Medical signs assist in arriving at an accurate diagnosis . Examples of signs include elevated blood pressure , nail clubbing of the fingernails or toenails, staggering gait , and arcus senilis and arcus juvenilis of the eyes. A sign is distinguished from an indication which is a specific reason for using a particular treatment . A symptom is something felt or experienced, such as pain or dizziness. Signs and symptoms are not mutually exclusive, for example a subjective feeling of fever can be noted as sign by using a thermometer that registers a high reading. [4]
Signs and symptoms are often non-specific, but some combinations can be suggestive of certain diagnoses , helping to narrow down what may be wrong. A particular set of characteristic signs and symptoms that may be associated with a disorder is known as a syndrome . In cases where the underlying cause is known the syndrome is named as for example Down syndrome and Noonan syndrome . Other syndromes such as acute coronary syndrome may have a number of possible causes.

Amnesia is a deficit in memory caused by brain damage or disease, [1] but it can also be caused temporarily by the use of various sedatives and hypnotic drugs . The memory can be either wholly or partially lost due to the extent of damage that was caused. [2] There are two main types of amnesia: retrograde amnesia and anterograde amnesia . Retrograde amnesia is the inability to retrieve information that was acquired before a particular date, usually the date of an accident or operation. [3] In some cases the memory loss can extend back decades, while in others the person may lose only a few months of memory. Anterograde amnesia is the inability to transfer new information from the short-term store into the long-term store. People with anterograde amnesia cannot remember things for long periods of time. These two types are not mutually exclusive; both can occur simultaneously. [4]
Case studies also show that amnesia is typically associated with damage to the medial temporal lobe . In addition, specific areas of the hippocampus (the CA1 region ) are involved with memory. Research has also shown that when areas of the diencephalon are damaged, amnesia can occur. Recent studies have shown a correlation between deficiency of RbAp48 protein and memory loss . Scientists were able to find that mice with damaged memory have a lower level of RbAp48 protein compared to normal, healthy mice. [5] [6] In people suffering with amnesia, the ability to recall immediate information is still retained, [7] [8] [ full citation needed ] [ better source needed ] and they may still be able to form new memories. However, a severe reduction in the ability to learn new material and retrieve old information can be observed. Patients can learn new procedural knowledge. In addition, priming (both perceptual and conceptual) can assist amnesiacs in the learning of fresh non-declarative knowledge. [1] Amnesic patients also retain substantial intellectual, linguistic, and social skill despite profound impairments in the ability to recall specific information encountered in prior learning episodes. [9] [10] [11]

Anhedonia is a diverse array of deficits in hedonic function, including reduced motivation or ability to experience pleasure. [1] While earlier definitions emphasized the inability to experience pleasure, anhedonia is currently used by researchers to refer to reduced motivation, reduced anticipatory pleasure (wanting), reduced consummatory pleasure (liking), and deficits in reinforcement learning. [2] [3] [4] In the DSM-5 , anhedonia is a component of depressive disorders, substance-related disorders, psychotic disorders, and personality disorders, where it is defined by either a reduced ability to experience pleasure, or a diminished interest in engaging in pleasurable activities. [5] [6] While the ICD-10 does not explicitly mention anhedonia, the depressive symptom analogous to anhedonia as described in the DSM-V is a loss of interest or pleasure. [3]
While anhedonia was originally defined in 1896 by Théodule-Armand Ribot as the reduced ability to experience pleasure, it has been used to refer to deficits in multiple facets of reward.  Re-conceptualizations of anhedonia highlight the independence of "wanting" and "liking".  "Wanting" is a component of anticipatory positive affect, mediating both the motivation (i.e. incentive salience) to engage with reward, as well as the positive emotions associated with anticipating a reward.  "Liking", on the other hand, is associated with the pleasure derived from consuming a reward. [2] [1] The consciousness of reward-related processes has also been used to categorize reward in the context of anhedonia, as studies comparing implicit behavior versus explicit self-reports demonstrate a dissociation of the two. [7] Learning has also been proposed as an independent facet of reward that may be impaired in conditions associated with anhedonia, but empirical evidence dissociating learning from either "liking" or "wanting" is lacking. [7]
Anosmia , also known as smell blindness , is the loss of the ability to detect one or more smells . [1] [2] Anosmia may be temporary or permanent. [3] It differs from hyposmia , which is a decreased sensitivity to some or all smells. [2]
Anosmia can be due to a number of factors, including an inflammation of the nasal mucosa , blockage of nasal passages or a destruction of one temporal lobe . Inflammation is due to chronic mucosa changes in the lining of the paranasal sinus and in the middle and superior turbinates .
When anosmia is caused by inflammatory changes in the nasal passageways, it is treated simply by reducing inflammation. [4] It can be caused by chronic meningitis and neurosyphilis that would increase intracranial pressure over a long period of time, [5] and in some cases by ciliopathy , [6] including ciliopathy due to primary ciliary dyskinesia . [7]
An aura is a perceptual disturbance experienced by some with epilepsy or migraine . An epileptic aura is in fact a seizure. [1]
Epileptic and migraine auras are due to the involvement of specific areas of the brain, which are those that determine the symptoms of the aura. Therefore, if the visual area is affected, the aura will consist of visual symptoms, while if a sensory one, then sensory symptoms will occur.
Epileptic auras are subjective sensory or psychic phenomena due to a focal seizure, i.e. a seizure that originates from that area of the brain responsible for the function which then expresses itself with the symptoms of the aura. It is important because it makes it clear where the alteration causing the seizure is located. An epileptic aura is in most cases followed by other manifestations of a seizure, for example a convulsion, since the epileptic discharge spreads to other parts of the brain. Rarely it remains isolated. Auras, when they occur, allow some people who have epilepsy time to prevent injury to themselves and/or others when they lose consciousness.
Automatic behavior , from the Greek automatos or self-acting, is the spontaneous production of often purposeless verbal or motor behavior without conscious self-control or self-censorship . This condition can be observed in a variety of contexts, including schizophrenia , psychogenic fugue , epilepsy (in complex partial seizures and Jacksonian seizures ), narcolepsy or in response to a traumatic event . The individual does not recall the behavior. According to the book 'The Mind Machine' by Colin Blakemore , hypoglycemia usually leads quickly to unconsciousness, but as blood glucose level falls, there is 'a window of experience between sanity and coma in which self-control is lost', and the body 'behaves on its own'.
Automatic behavior can also be exhibited whilst in the REM state—subjects can hold conversations, sit up and even open their eyes. Those acts are considered sub-conscious as most of the time the events cannot be recalled by the subject. It is most common when the subject has had under 10 hours sleep within a 36-hour period.

Bibliomania can be a symptom of obsessive–compulsive disorder which involves the collecting or even hoarding of books to the point where social relations or health are damaged.
Bibliomania is not to be confused with bibliophilia , which is the (psychologically healthy) love of books, and as such is not considered a clinical psychological disorder.
One of several unusual behaviors associated with books, bibliomania is characterized by the collecting of books which have no use to the collector nor any great intrinsic value to a genuine book collector. The purchase of multiple copies of the same book and edition and the accumulation of books beyond possible capacity of use or enjoyment are frequent symptoms of bibliomania. [1] Bibliomania is not a psychological disorder recognized by the American Psychiatric Association in its DSM-IV. [2]
Blunt trauma , also known as blunt force trauma or non-penetrating trauma , is physical trauma or impactful force to a body part, often occurring with road traffic collisions , direct blows, assaults , injuries during sports , and particularly in the elderly who fall . [1] [2] It is contrasted with penetrating trauma which occurs when an object pierces the skin and enters a tissue of the body, creating an open wound and bruise . [3]
Blunt trauma can result in contusions , abrasions , lacerations , internal hemorrhages , and bone fractures . [1]
Worldwide, a significant cause of disability and death in people under the age of 35 years is trauma, of which most are due to blunt trauma. [1]
Catalepsy (from Ancient Greek katálēpsis , κατάληψις , "seizing, grasping") is a nervous condition characterized by muscular rigidity and fixity of posture regardless of external stimuli, as well as decreased sensitivity to pain . [1]
Symptoms include a rigid body, rigid limbs, limbs staying in same position when moved ( waxy flexibility ), no response, loss of muscle control, and slowing down of bodily functions, such as breathing. [2]
Catalepsy is a symptom of certain nervous disorders or conditions such as Parkinson's disease and epilepsy . It is also a characteristic symptom of cocaine withdrawal, as well as one of the features of catatonia . [ citation needed ] It can be caused by schizophrenia treatment with anti-psychotics , [3] such as haloperidol , [4] and by the anesthetic ketamine . [5] Protein kinase A has been suggested as a mediator of cataleptic behavior. [6] Unsuggested waxy catalepsy, sometimes accompanied by spontaneous anesthesia, is seen as an indicator of hypnotic trance. [7] Suggested or induced rigid catalepsy, of extended limbs or even the entire body, sometimes tested with heavy weights, has been a staple of stage hypnosis shows and even academic demonstrations of hypnotism since the late 18th century, as proof of extraordinary physical abilities possible in trance states. [ citation needed ] Such demonstrations have also been performed by Asian martial artists to prove the presence of "ki" or "chi" power, a kind of psychological or spiritual resource.

Chorea (or choreia , occasionally) is an abnormal involuntary movement disorder , one of a group of neurological disorders called dyskinesias . The term chorea is derived from the Ancient Greek : χορεία ("dance"; see choreia ), as the quick movements of the feet or hands are comparable to dancing.
The term hemichorea refers to chorea of one side of the body, such as chorea of one arm but not both (analogous to hemiballismus ).
Chorea is characterized by brief, semi-directed, irregular movements that are not repetitive or rhythmic, but appear to flow from one muscle to the next. These 'dance-like' movements of chorea often occur with athetosis , which adds twisting and writhing movements. Walking may become difficult, and include odd postures and leg movements.
A coma is a deep state of prolonged unconsciousness in which a person cannot be awakened, fails to respond normally to painful stimuli, light, or sound, lacks a normal wake-sleep cycle and does not initiate voluntary actions. [2] Coma patients exhibit a complete absence of wakefulness and are unable to consciously feel, speak or move. [3] Comas can be derived by natural causes, or can be medically induced .
Clinically, a coma can be defined as the inability consistently to follow a one-step command. [4] It can also be defined as a score of ≤ 8 on the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) lasting ≥ 6 hours. For a patient to maintain consciousness, the components of wakefulness and awareness must be maintained. Wakefulness describes the quantitative degree of consciousness , whereas awareness relates to the qualitative aspects of the functions mediated by the cortex, including cognitive abilities such as attention, sensory perception, explicit memory, language, the execution of tasks, temporal and spatial orientation and reality judgment. [3] [5] From a neurological perspective, consciousness is maintained by the activation of the cerebral cortex —the gray matter that forms the outer layer of the brain and by the reticular activating system (RAS), a structure located within the brainstem . [6] [7]
The term 'coma', from the Greek κῶμα koma , meaning deep sleep, had already been used in the Hippocratic corpus ( Epidemica ) and later by Galen (second century AD). Subsequently, it was hardly used in the known literature up to the middle of the 17th century. The term is found again in Thomas Willis ' (1621–1675) influential De anima brutorum (1672), where lethargy (pathological sleep), 'coma' (heavy sleeping), carus (deprivation of the senses) and apoplexy (into which carus could turn and which he localized in the white matter ) are mentioned. The term carus is also derived from Greek, where it can be found in the roots of several words meaning soporific or sleepy. It can still be found in the root of the term 'carotid'. Thomas Sydenham (1624–89) mentioned the term 'coma' in several cases of fever (Sydenham, 1685). [8] [9]
A cough is a sudden expulsion of air through the large breathing passages that can help clear them of fluids, irritants, foreign particles and microbes . As a protective reflex , coughing can be repetitive with the cough reflex following three phases: an inhalation , a forced exhalation against a closed glottis , and a violent release of air from the lungs following opening of the glottis, usually accompanied by a distinctive sound. [1]
Frequent coughing usually indicates the presence of a disease. Many viruses and bacteria benefit, from an evolutionary perspective, by causing the host to cough, which helps to spread the disease to new hosts. Most of the time, irregular coughing is caused by a respiratory tract infection but can also be triggered by choking , smoking , air pollution , [1] asthma , gastroesophageal reflux disease , post-nasal drip , chronic bronchitis , lung tumors , heart failure and medications such as angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) .
Treatment should target the cause; for example, smoking cessation or discontinuing ACE inhibitors. Cough suppressants such as codeine or dextromethorphan are frequently prescribed, but have been demonstrated to have little effect. Other treatment options may target airway inflammation or may promote mucus expectoration . As it is a natural protective reflex, suppressing the cough reflex might have damaging effects, especially if the cough is productive. [2]
Delirium , also known as acute confusional state , is the organically caused decline from a previous baseline mental functioning that develops over a short period of time, typically hours to days. [1] [2] Delirium is a syndrome encompassing disturbances in attention, consciousness, and cognition. It may also involve other neurological deficits, such as psychomotor disturbances (e.g. hyperactive, hypoactive, or mixed), impaired sleep-wake cycle, emotional disturbances, and perceptual disturbances (e.g. hallucinations and delusions), although these features are not required for diagnosis.
Delirium is caused by an acute organic process , which is a physically identifiable structural, functional, or chemical problem in the brain that may arise from a disease process outside the brain that nonetheless affects the brain. It may result from an underlying disease process (e.g. infection, hypoxia ), side effect of a medication, withdrawal from drugs, over-consumption of alcohol , usage of hallucinogenic deliriants , or from any number of factors affecting one's overall health (e.g. malnutrition, pain, etc.). In contrast, fluctuations in mental status/function due to changes in primarily psychiatric processes or diseases (e.g. schizophrenia , bipolar disorder ) do not, by definition, meet the criteria for 'delirium.' [3]
Delirium may be difficult to diagnose without the proper establishment of a person's usual mental function. Without careful assessment and history, delirium can easily be confused with a number of psychiatric disorders or chronic organic brain syndromes because of many overlapping signs and symptoms in common with dementia , depression , psychosis , etc. [4] Delirium may manifest from a baseline of existing mental illness, baseline intellectual disability, or dementia, without being due to any of these problems.
Delirium tremens ( DTs ) is a rapid onset of confusion usually caused by withdrawal from alcohol . [2] When it occurs, it is often three days into the withdrawal symptoms and lasts for two to three days. [2] Physical effects may include shaking , shivering, irregular heart rate , and sweating. [1] People may also hallucinate . [2] Occasionally, a very high body temperature or seizures may result in death. [2] Alcohol is one of the most dangerous drugs from which to withdraw . [5]
Delirium tremens typically only occurs in people with a high intake of alcohol for more than a month. [6] A similar syndrome may occur with benzodiazepine and barbiturate withdrawal . [3] Withdrawal from stimulants such as cocaine do not have major medical complications. [7] In a person with delirium tremens it is important to rule out other associated problems such as electrolyte abnormalities , pancreatitis , and alcoholic hepatitis . [2]
Prevention is by treating withdrawal symptoms. [2] If delirium tremens occurs, aggressive treatment improves outcomes. [2] Treatment in a quiet intensive care unit with sufficient light is often recommended. [2] Benzodiazepines are the medication of choice with diazepam , lorazepam , chlordiazepoxide , and oxazepam all commonly used. [6] They should be given until a person is lightly sleeping. [2] The antipsychotic haloperidol may also be used. [2] The vitamin thiamine is recommended. [2] Mortality without treatment is between 15% and 40%. [4] Currently death occurs in about 1% to 4% of cases. [2]


Depression is a state of low mood and aversion to activity. [2] It can affect a person's thoughts, behavior, motivation, feelings , and sense of well-being . [3] The core symptom of depression is said to be anhedonia , which refers to loss of interest or a loss of feeling of pleasure in certain activities that usually bring joy to people. [4] Depressed mood is a symptom of some mood disorders such as major depressive disorder or dysthymia ; [5] it is a normal temporary reaction to life events, such as the loss of a loved one; and it is also a symptom of some physical diseases and a side effect of some drugs and medical treatments.
It may feature sadness, difficulty in thinking and concentration and a significant increase or decrease in appetite and time spent sleeping. People experiencing depression may have feelings of dejection, hopelessness and, sometimes, suicidal thoughts. It can either be short term or long term.


Diarrhea , also spelled diarrhoea , is the condition of having at least three loose, liquid, or watery bowel movements each day. [2] It often lasts for a few days and can result in dehydration due to fluid loss. [2] Signs of dehydration often begin with loss of the normal stretchiness of the skin and irritable behaviour. [2] This can progress to decreased urination , loss of skin color , a fast heart rate , and a decrease in responsiveness as it becomes more severe. [2] Loose but non-watery stools in babies who are exclusively breastfed , however, are normal. [2]
Erythema ab igne (EAI) , also known as hot water bottle rash , [2] is a skin condition caused by long-term exposure to heat ( infrared radiation ). [3] Prolonged thermal radiation exposure to the skin can lead to the development of reticulated erythema , hyperpigmentation, scaling and telangiectasias in the affected area. Some people may complain of mild itchiness and a burning sensation, but often, unless a change in pigmentation is seen, it can go unnoticed.
Different types of heat sources can cause this condition such as:
The pathogenesis of erythema ab igne remains unknown. It has been proposed that thermal radiation exposure can induce damage to superficial blood vessels that subsequently leads to epidermal vascular dilation. The dilation of vessels presents morphologically as the initially observed erythema. [4] Red blood cell extravasion and deposition of hemosiderin that follows clinically appears as hyperpigmentation, which can occur in a reticular distribution. It has also been proposed that the distribution of affected blood vessels — predominantly in the superficial subcutaneous plexus (found in the papillary dermis )— results in the net-like pattern of erythema ab igne skin lesions.
In psychology , a false memory is a phenomenon where someone recalls something that did not happen or recalls it differently from the way it actually happened. Suggestibility , activation of associated information, the incorporation of misinformation, and source misattribution have been suggested to be several mechanisms underlying a variety of types of false memory phenomena.
False memories are a component of false memory syndrome (FMS). [1]
The false memory phenomenon was initially investigated by psychological pioneers Pierre Janet and Sigmund Freud . [2]
A fasciculation , or muscle twitch , is a spontaneous, involuntary muscle contraction and relaxation, involving fine muscle fibers. [1] They are common, with as much as 70% of people experiencing them. [1] They can be benign, or associated with more serious conditions. [1] When no cause or pathology is identified, they are diagnosed as benign fasciculation syndrome . [1]
The most effective way to detect fasciculations may be surface electromyography (EMG). Surface EMG is more sensitive than needle electromyography and clinical observation in the detection of fasciculation in people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis . [2]
Deeper areas of contraction can be detected by electromyography (EMG) testing, though they can happen in any skeletal muscle in the body. Fasciculations arise as a result of spontaneous depolarization of a lower motor neuron leading to the synchronous contraction of all the skeletal muscle fibers within a single motor unit. An example of normal spontaneous depolarization is the constant contractions of cardiac muscle , causing the heart to beat. Usually, intentional movement of the involved muscle causes fasciculations to cease immediately, but they may return once the muscle is at rest again.

Fever , also referred to as pyrexia , is defined as having a temperature above the normal range due to an increase in the body's temperature set point . [1] [6] [7] There is not a single agreed-upon upper limit for normal temperature with sources using values between 37.2 and 38.3 °C (99.0 and 100.9 °F) in humans. [1] [2] [8] The increase in set point triggers increased muscle contractions and causes a feeling of cold or chills . [3] This results in greater heat production and efforts to conserve heat. [4] When the set point temperature returns to normal, a person feels hot, becomes flushed , and may begin to sweat . [4] Rarely a fever may trigger a febrile seizure , with this being more common in young children. [5] Fevers do not typically go higher than 41 to 42 °C (105.8 to 107.6 °F). [7]
A fever can be caused by many medical conditions ranging from non-serious to life-threatening . [12] This includes viral , bacterial , and parasitic infections —such as influenza , the common cold , meningitis , urinary tract infections , appendicitis , COVID-19 , and malaria . [12] [13] Non-infectious causes include vasculitis , deep vein thrombosis , connective tissue disease , side effects of medication, and cancer . [12] [14] It differs from hyperthermia , in that hyperthermia is an increase in body temperature over the temperature set point, due to either too much heat production or not enough heat loss . [2]
A fistula (plural: fistulas or fistulae /- l i , - l aɪ / ; from Latin fistula , "tube, pipe") is an abnormal connection between two hollow spaces (technically, two epithelialized surfaces), such as blood vessels , intestines , or other hollow organs . [2] [3] [4]
Types of fistula can be described by their location. Anal fistulas connect between the anal canal and the perianal skin. Anovaginal or rectovaginal fistulas occur when a hole develops between the anus or rectum and the vagina . Colovaginal fistulas occur between the colon and the vagina. Urinary tract fistulas are abnormal openings within the urinary tract or an abnormal connection between the urinary tract and another organ such as between the bladder and the uterus in a vesicouterine fistula, between the bladder and the vagina in a vesicovaginal fistula, and between the urethra and the vagina in urethrovaginal fistula. When occurring between two parts of the intestine, it is known as an enteroenteral fistula, between the small intestine and the skin as an enterocutaneous fistula, and between the small intestine and the colon as a colocutaneous fistula. [3]
Fistulas can result from an infection or inflammation, injury or surgery. [5] Fistulas are sometimes purposefully surgically created as part of a treatment, for example arteriovenous fistulas for hemodialysis . [6]
Frequent urination is the need to urinate more often than usual. Diuretics or medications that will increase urinary frequency. Nocturia is the need of frequent urination at night. [1] The most common cause of urinary frequency for women and children is a urinary tract infection . The most common cause of urinary frequency in older men is an enlarged prostate . [2]
Frequent urination is strongly associated with frequent incidents of urinary urgency , which is the sudden need to urinate.  It is often, though not necessarily, associated with urinary incontinence and polyuria (large total volume of urine). However, in other cases, urinary frequency involves only normal volumes of urine overall. [3] [ citation needed ]
The normal number of times varies according to the age of the person.  Among young children, urinating 8 to 14 times each day is typical.  This decreases to 6 to 12 times per day for older children, and to four to six times per day among teenagers. [4]
Gangrene is a type of tissue death caused by a lack of blood supply . [4] Symptoms may include a change in skin color to red or black, numbness, swelling, pain, skin breakdown, and coolness. [1] The feet and hands are most commonly affected. [1] If the gangrene is caused by an infectious agent it may present with a fever or sepsis . [1]
Risk factors include diabetes , peripheral arterial disease , smoking , major trauma , alcoholism , HIV/AIDS , frostbite , influenza , COVID-19 , dengue fever , malaria , plague , meningococcal disease , Group B streptococcal infection and Raynaud's syndrome . [3] [4] It can be classified as dry gangrene , wet gangrene , gas gangrene , internal gangrene , and necrotizing fasciitis . [3] The diagnosis of gangrene is based on symptoms and supported by tests such as medical imaging . [6]
Treatment may involve surgery to remove the dead tissue, antibiotics to treat any infection, and efforts to address the underlying cause. [5] Surgical efforts may include debridement , amputation , or the use of maggot therapy . [5] Efforts to treat the underlying cause may include bypass surgery or angioplasty . [5] In certain cases, hyperbaric oxygen therapy may be useful. [5] How commonly the condition occurs is unknown. [2]


Gynecomastia (also spelled Gynaecomastia ) [a] is the abnormal non-cancerous enlargement of one or both breasts in men due to the growth of breast tissue as a result of a hormone imbalance between estrogen and androgen . [4] [5] Gynecomastia can cause significant psychological distress or unease . [6]

Bad breath , also known as halitosis , is a symptom in which a noticeably unpleasant breath odour is present. [1] It can result in anxiety among those affected. [1] It is also associated with depression and symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder . [1]
The concerns of bad breath may be divided into genuine and non-genuine cases. [2] Of those who have genuine bad breath, about 85% of cases come from inside the mouth. [1] The remaining cases are believed to be due to disorders in the nose , sinuses , throat , lungs , esophagus , or stomach . [4] Rarely, bad breath can be due to an underlying medical condition such as liver failure or ketoacidosis . [2] Non-genuine cases occur when someone feels they have bad breath but someone else cannot detect it. [2] This is estimated to make up between 5% and 72% of cases. [2]
Headache is the symptom of pain in the face , head , or neck . It can occur as a migraine , tension-type headache , or cluster headache . There is an increased risk of depression in those with severe headaches. [1]
Headaches can occur as a result of many conditions. There are a number of different classification systems for headaches. The most well-recognized is that of the International Headache Society . Causes of headaches may include dehydration, fatigue, sleep deprivation, stress, the effects of medications, the effects of recreational drugs, viral infections, loud noises, common colds, head injury, rapid ingestion of a very cold food or beverage, and dental or sinus issues (such as sinusitis ). [2]
Treatment of a headache depends on the underlying cause, but commonly involves pain medication . A headache is one of the most commonly experienced of all physical discomforts.
Heartburn , also known as pyrosis , cardialgia or acid indigestion , [2] is a burning sensation in the central chest or upper central abdomen . [3] [4] [5] The discomfort often rises in the chest and may radiate to the neck, throat, or angle of the arm.
Heartburn is usually due to regurgitation of gastric acid (gastric reflux) into the esophagus and is the major symptom of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). [6] In about 0.6% of cases it is a symptom of ischemic heart disease . [7]
The term indigestion includes heartburn along with a number of other symptoms. [8] Indigestion is sometimes defined as a combination of epigastric pain and heartburn. [9] Heartburn is commonly used interchangeably with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) rather than just to describe a symptom of burning in one's chest. [10]

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by inattention , or excessive activity and impulsivity , which are otherwise not appropriate for a person's age. [1] [2] [3] [4] Some individuals with ADHD also display difficulty regulating emotions or problems with executive function . [1] [5] [6] [7] For a diagnosis, the symptoms have to be present for more than six months, and cause problems in at least two settings (such as school, home, work, or recreational activities). [1] [2] In children, problems paying attention may result in poor school performance . [8] Additionally, it is associated with other mental disorders and substance use disorders . [9] Although it causes impairment, particularly in modern society, many people with ADHD can have sustained attention for tasks they find interesting or rewarding (known as hyperfocus ). [10] [11]
Despite being the most commonly studied and diagnosed mental disorder in children and adolescents, the precise cause or causes are unknown in the majority of cases. [12] Genetic factors are estimated to make up about 75% of the risk. [13] Nicotine exposure during pregnancy may be an environmental risk. [14] It does not appear to be related to the style of parenting or discipline. [15] It affects about 5–7% of children when diagnosed via the DSM-IV criteria [1] [16] and 1–2% when diagnosed via the ICD-10 criteria. [17] As of 2019, it was estimated to affect 84.7 million people globally. [18] Rates are similar between countries and differences in rates depend mostly on how it is diagnosed. [19] ADHD is diagnosed approximately two times more often in boys than in girls, [1] although the disorder is often overlooked in girls because their symptoms are often less disruptive. [20] [21] [22] About 30–50% of people diagnosed in childhood continue to have symptoms into adulthood and between 2–5% of adults have the condition. [23] [24] [25] In adults, inner restlessness, rather than hyperactivity, may occur. [26] Adults often develop coping skills which compensate for some or all of their impairments. [27] The condition can be difficult to tell apart from other conditions, as well as from high levels of activity within the range of normal behavior. [28]

Hysteria is a pejorative term used colloquially to mean ungovernable emotional excess and can refer to a temporary state of mind or emotion. [1] In the 19th century, hysteria was considered a diagnosable physical illness in females. It is assumed that the basis for diagnosis operated under the belief that women are predisposed to mental and behavioral conditions; a misinterpretation of gender-related differences in stress responses. [2] In the 20th century, it shifted to being considered a mental illness. [3] Many influential persons such as Sigmund Freud and Jean-Martin Charcot dedicated research to hysteria patients. [4] Currently, most doctors practicing Western medicine do not accept hysteria as a medical diagnosis. [5] The blanket diagnosis of hysteria has been fragmented into myriad medical categories such as epilepsy , histrionic personality disorder , conversion disorders , dissociative disorders , or other medical conditions. [5] [6] Furthermore, lifestyle choices, such as deciding not to wed, are no longer considered symptoms of psychological disorders such as hysteria. [5]
The word hysteria originates from the Greek word for uterus , hystera . [5] The oldest record of hysteria dates back to 1900 B.C. when Egyptians recorded behavioral abnormalities in adult women on medical papyrus. [5] The Egyptians attributed the behavioral disturbances to a wandering uterus—thus later dubbing the condition hysteria. [5] To treat hysteria Egyptian doctors prescribed various medications. [5] For example, doctors put strong smelling substances on the patients’ vulvas to encourage the uterus to return to its proper position. [5] Another tactic was to smell or swallow unsavory herbs to encourage the uterus to flee back to the lower part of the female’s abdomen. [5]
Itch (also known as pruritus ) is a sensation that causes the desire or reflex to scratch. [1] Itch has resisted many attempts to be classified as any one type of sensory experience. Itch has many similarities to pain , and while both are unpleasant sensory experiences, their behavioral response patterns are different. Pain creates a withdrawal reflex , whereas itch leads to a scratch reflex . [2]
Unmyelinated nerve fibers for itch and pain both originate in the skin ; however, information for them is conveyed centrally in two distinct systems that both use the same nerve bundle and spinothalamic tract . [3]
Most commonly, an itch is felt in one place.  If it is felt all over the body, then it is called generalized itch or generalized pruritus . [4]
Jaundice , also known as icterus , is a yellowish or greenish pigmentation of the skin and whites of the eyes due to high bilirubin levels . [3] [6] Jaundice in adults is typically a sign indicating the presence of underlying diseases involving abnormal heme metabolism , liver dysfunction , or biliary-tract obstruction. [7] The prevalence of jaundice in adults is rare, while jaundice in babies is common, with an estimated 80% affected during their first week of life. [8] The most commonly associated symptoms of jaundice are itchiness , [2] pale feces , and dark urine . [4]
Normal levels of bilirubin in blood are below 1.0 mg / dl (17 μmol / L ), while levels over 2–3 mg/dl (34-51 μmol/L) typically result in jaundice. [4] [9] High blood bilirubin is divided into two types - unconjugated  and conjugated bilirubin. [10]
Causes of jaundice vary from nonserious to potentially fatal. [10] High unconjugated bilirubin may be due to excess red blood cell breakdown , large bruises , genetic conditions such as Gilbert's syndrome , not eating for a prolonged period of time, newborn jaundice, or thyroid problems . [4] [10] High conjugated bilirubin may be due to liver diseases such as cirrhosis or hepatitis , infections, medications , or blockage of the bile duct ,. [4] due to factors including gallstones , cancer , or pancreatitis . [4] Other conditions can also cause yellowish skin, but are not jaundice, including carotenemia , which can develop from eating large amounts of foods containing carotene — or medications such as rifampin . [4]
Mass psychogenic illness ( MPI ), also called mass sociogenic illness , mass psychogenic disorder , epidemic hysteria , or mass hysteria , is the rapid spread of illness signs and symptoms affecting members of a cohesive group, originating from a nervous system disturbance involving excitation, loss, or alteration of function, whereby physical complaints that are exhibited unconsciously have no corresponding organic aetiology . [1]
Mass psychogenic illness involves the spread of illness symptoms through a population where there is no infectious agent responsible for contagion. [2] MPI is distinct from other types of collective delusions by involving physical symptoms. [3] According to Balaratnasingam and Janca, "Mass hysteria is to date a poorly understood condition. Little certainty exists regarding its etiology." [4] Qualities of MPI outbreaks often include: [3]
British psychiatrist Simon Wesseley distinguishes between two forms of MPI: [1]

In medicine, confusion is the quality or state of being bewildered or unclear. The term "acute mental confusion" [1] is often used interchangeably with delirium [2] in the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems and the Medical Subject Headings publications to describe the pathology . These refer to the loss of orientation , or the ability to place oneself correctly in the world by time, location and personal identity. Mental confusion is sometimes accompanied by disordered consciousness (the loss of linear thinking) and memory loss (the inability to correctly recall previous events or learn new material). [3] The term is from Latin : confusĭo, -ōnis , from confundere : "to pour together", "to mingle together", "to confuse".
Confusion may result from drug side effects or from a relatively sudden brain dysfunction.  Acute confusion is often called delirium (or "acute confusional state"), [4] although delirium often includes a much broader array of disorders than simple confusion.  These disorders include the inability to focus attention; various impairments in awareness, and temporal or spatial dis-orientation.  Mental confusion can result from chronic organic brain pathologies, such as dementia [ citation needed ] , as well.
Nausea is a diffuse sensation of unease and discomfort, often perceived as an urge to vomit . [1] While not painful, it can be a debilitating symptom if prolonged and has been described as placing discomfort on the chest, upper abdomen, or back of the throat. [2]
Over 30 definitions of nausea were proposed in a 2011 book on the topic. [3]
Nausea is a non-specific symptom , which means that it has many possible causes. Some common causes of nausea are gastroenteritis and other gastrointestinal disorders , food poisoning , motion sickness , dizziness , migraine , fainting , low blood sugar and lack of sleep . Nausea is a side effect of many medications including chemotherapy , or morning sickness in early pregnancy. Nausea may also be caused by disgust and depression . [1]
Pallor is a pale color of the skin that can be caused by illness, emotional shock or stress, stimulant use, or anemia , and is the result of a reduced amount of oxyhaemoglobin and may also be visible as pallor of the conjunctivae of the eyes on physical examination.
Pallor is more evident on the face and palms . It can develop suddenly or gradually, depending on the cause. It is not usually clinically significant unless it is accompanied by a general pallor (pale lips , tongue , palms, mouth and other regions with mucous membranes ). It is distinguished from similar presentations such as hypopigmentation (lack or loss of skin pigment ) or simply a fair complexion.

A persistent vegetative state ( PVS ) or post-coma unresponsiveness [1] ( PCU ) is a disorder of consciousness in which patients with severe brain damage are in a state of partial arousal rather than true awareness . After four weeks in a vegetative state (VS), the patient is classified as in a persistent vegetative state. This diagnosis is classified as a permanent vegetative state some months (three in the US and six in the UK) after a non-traumatic brain injury or one year after a traumatic injury. Today, doctors and neuroscientists prefer to call the state of consciousness a syndrome , [2] primarily because of ethical questions about whether a patient can be called "vegetative" or not. [2]
There are several definitions that vary by technical versus layman's usage. There are different legal implications in different countries.
A wakeful unconscious state that lasts longer than a few weeks is referred to as a persistent (or 'continuing') vegetative state. [3]

Intellectual disability ( ID ), also known as general learning disability [3] and formerly mental retardation ( MR ), [4] [5] is a generalized neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by significantly impaired intellectual and adaptive functioning . It is defined by an IQ under 70 , in addition to deficits in two or more adaptive behaviors that affect everyday, general living. Intellectual functions are defined under DSM-V as reasoning, problem‑solving, planning, abstract thinking, judgment, academic learning, and learning from instruction and experience, and practical understanding confirmed by both clinical assessment and standardized tests. Adaptive behavior is defined in terms of conceptual, social, and practical skills involving tasks performed by people in their everyday lives. [6]
Once focused almost entirely on cognition , the definition now includes both a component relating to mental functioning and one relating to an individual's functional skills in their daily environment. As a result of this focus on the person's abilities in practice, a person with an unusually low IQ may still not be considered to have an intellectual disability. [ citation needed ]
Phantosmia (phantom smell), also called an olfactory hallucination or a phantom odor , [1] is smelling an odor that is not actually there. It can occur in one nostril or both. [2] Unpleasant phantosmia, cacosmia , is more common and is often described as smelling something that is burned, foul, spoiled, or rotten. [3] Experiencing occasional phantom smells is normal and usually goes away on its own in time. [4] When hallucinations of this type do not seem to go away or when they keep coming back, it can be very upsetting and can disrupt an individual's quality of life. [2]
Olfactory hallucinations can be caused by common medical conditions such as nasal infections, nasal polyps , or dental problems. It can result from neurological conditions such as migraines, head injuries, strokes, Parkinson's disease , seizures , or brain tumors. [4] It can also be a symptom of certain mental disorders such as depression , bipolar disorder , intoxication or withdrawal from  drugs and alcohol, or psychotic disorders . [3] Environmental exposures are sometimes the cause as well, such as smoking, exposure to certain types of chemicals (e.g., insecticides or solvents ), or radiation treatment for head or neck cancer. [4]
A physician can determine if the problem is with the sense of smell ( olfactory system ) or taste ( gustatory system ), or if it is caused by a neurological or psychiatric disorder. Phantosmia usually goes away on its own, though this can sometimes be gradual and occur over several years. [2] When caused by an illness (e.g., sinusitis ), it should go away when the illness resolves. [4] If the problem persists or causes significant discomfort, a doctor might recommend nasal saline drops, antidepressant or anticonvulsant medications, anesthesia to parts of the nose, or in very rare circumstances, surgical procedures to remove the olfactory nerves or bulbs . [2] [3]
Polydipsia is excessive thirst or excess drinking. [1] The word derives from the Greek πολυδίψιος ( poludípsios ) "very thirsty", [2] which is derived from πολύς ( polús , "much, many") + δίψα ( dípsa , "thirst").  Polydipsia is a nonspecific symptom in various medical disorders. It also occurs as an abnormal behaviour in some non-human animals , such as in birds . [3]
Polydipsia can be characteristic of diabetes mellitus , often as an initial symptom. It is observed in cases of poorly controlled diabetes, which is sometimes the result of low patient adherence to anti-diabetic medication . [1]
Diabetes insipidus ("tasteless" diabetes, as opposed to diabetes mellitus) can also cause polydipsia. [1]
Retching (also known as dry heaving ) is the reverse movement ( retroperistalsis ) of the stomach and esophagus without vomiting . [1] It can be caused by bad smells or choking, or by withdrawal from some medications after vomiting stops. Retching can also occur as a result of an emotional response or from stress , which produces the same physical reaction. The function is thought to be mixing gastric contents with intestinal refluxate in order to buffer the former and give it momentum in preparation of vomiting. [2] Treatments include medication and correction of the fluid and electrolyte balance .
The retching phase is characterized by a series of violent spasmodic abdomino - thoracic contractions with the glottis closed. During this time, the inspiratory (inhalatory) movements of the chest wall and diaphragm are opposed by the expiratory contractions of the abdominal musculature. At the same time, movements of the stomach and its contents take place. Whereas a patient will complain of disagreeable sensations during nausea , speech is not possible during retching. The characteristic movements furnish a ready diagnostic sign of the retching phase. Schindler (1937) [3] studied retching on two occasions during gastroscopy and noted that longitudinal folds appeared in the previously smooth antrum , thickened quickly, came together and completely closed the antrum. [4] Retching involves a deep inspiration against a closed glottis . This, along with contraction of the abdomen, leads to a pressure difference between the abdominal and thoracic cavities. As a result, the stomach and gastric contents are displaced upwards toward the thoracic cavity. [5]
Retching comprises a rhythmically alternating (about once per second) elevation and descension of the entire pharyngolaryngo-esophago-gastric apparatus in synchrony with the movement of the diaphragm. The function of retching may be to mix gastric contents with intestinal refluxate to buffer gastric contents before gastroesophageal reflux and to impart a momentum to the gastric contents before vomiting. Airway protection during retching is accomplished by glottal closure during retches and constriction of the upper esophageal sphincter between retches. [2]
Retrograde amnesia ( RA ) is a loss of memory-access to events that occurred or information that was learned in the past. It is caused by an injury or the onset of a disease. [1] It tends to negatively affect episodic , autobiographical , and declarative memory , while keeping procedural memory intact without increasing difficulty for learning new information. RA can be temporally graded, or more permanent based on the severity of its cause. It is usually consistent with Ribot's law . The law states that subjects are more likely to lose memories closer to the traumatic incident than more memories that happened further from the incident. [2] The type of information that is forgotten can range from a specific memory, such as a single event, or a more general memory. This would resemble generic amnesia . Anterograde amnesia is a similar condition that deals with the inability to form new memories following the onset of an injury or disease.
RA commonly results from damage to regions of the brain that are associated with episodic and declarative memory, including autobiographical information. In extreme cases, individuals may completely forget who they are. Generally, this is a more severe type of amnesia known as global , or generalized amnesia. [3] However, memory loss can also be selective or categorical, manifested by a person's inability to remember events related to a specific incident or topic. Patients also differ in durations of RA (how long they can't recall information) and durations of what is forgotten (past time frame for which information is unavailable).
In temporally graded retrograde amnesia, victims eventually recover most memories following the onset of RA. This suggests that the hippocampal formation / consolidation, the process of coding new information, [4] is only used in systematic consolidation for temporary storage, and short periods of time. Systemic consolidation then moves the information and long-term consolidation takes place in other brain structures. [5] The fact that damage to the hippocampal formation can eventually overcome RA suggests that other brain structures are able to take over the jobs of the malfunctioning regions. RA can also progress and further deteriorate memory recollection, as in the case of Korsakoff syndrome and Alzheimer's disease , due to the ongoing nature of the damage caused by the illnesses. The degree to which different patients recover from RA differs in time (some take a few days while others a few decades) and content (some will only remember certain specific instances while others more).
Schizophreniform disorder is a mental disorder diagnosed when symptoms of schizophrenia are present for a significant portion of time (at least a month), but signs of disturbance are not present for the full six months required for the diagnosis of schizophrenia.
The symptoms of both disorders can include delusions , hallucinations , disorganized speech , disorganized or catatonic behavior , and social withdrawal . While impairment in social, occupational, or academic functioning is required for the diagnosis of schizophrenia, in schizophreniform disorder an individual's level of functioning may or may not be affected. While the onset of schizophrenia is often gradual over a number of months or years, the onset of schizophreniform disorder can be relatively rapid.
Like schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder is often treated with antipsychotic medications , especially the atypicals , along with a variety of social supports (such as individual psychotherapy , family therapy , occupational therapy , etc.) designed to reduce the social and emotional impact of the illness. The prognosis varies depending upon the nature, severity, and duration of the symptoms, but about two-thirds of individuals diagnosed with schizophreniform disorder go on to develop schizophrenia. [1]
Sexual addiction , also known as sex addiction , is a state characterized by compulsive participation or engagement in sexual activity , particularly sexual intercourse , despite negative consequences. [1]
Proponents of a diagnostic model for sexual addiction consider it to be one of several sex-related disorders within hypersexual disorder . [2] The term sexual dependence is also used to refer to people who report being unable to control their sexual urges , behaviors, or thoughts. Related or synonymous models of pathological sexual behavior include hypersexuality (nymphomania and satyriasis), erotomania , Don Juanism , and paraphilia -related disorders. [3] [4] [5]
The concept of sexual addiction is contentious. [6] [7] There is considerable debate among psychiatrists , psychologists , sexologists , and other specialists whether compulsive sexual behavior constitutes an addiction, and therefore its classification and possible diagnosis. Animal research has established that compulsive sexual behavior arises from the same transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms that mediate drug addiction in laboratory animals; however, as of 2018, [update] sexual addiction is not a clinical diagnosis in either the DSM or ICD medical classifications of diseases and medical disorders. Some argue that applying such concepts to normal behaviors such as sex can be problematic, and suggest that applying medical models such as addiction to human sexuality can serve to pathologise normal behavior and cause harm. [8]
Sinusitis , also known as rhinosinusitis , is inflammation of the mucous membranes that line the sinuses resulting in symptoms that may include thick nasal mucus , a plugged nose , and facial pain . [1] [6] Other signs and symptoms may include fever , headaches , a poor sense of smell , sore throat , and a cough . [2] It is defined as acute sinusitis if it lasts less than 4 weeks, and as chronic sinusitis if it lasts for more than 12 weeks. [1]
Sinusitis can be caused by infection , allergies , air pollution , or structural problems in the nose. [2] Most cases are caused by a viral infection . [2] Recurrent episodes are more likely in persons with asthma , cystic fibrosis , and poor immune function . [1] X-rays are not usually needed unless complications are suspected. [1] In chronic cases, confirmatory testing is recommended by either direct visualization or computed tomography . [1]
Some cases may be prevented by hand washing, avoiding smoking, and immunization . [2] Pain killers such as naproxen , nasal steroids , and nasal irrigation may be used to help with symptoms. [1] [4] Recommended initial treatment for acute sinusitis is watchful waiting . [1] If symptoms do not improve in 7–10 days or get worse, then an antibiotic may be used or changed. [1] In those in whom antibiotics are used, either amoxicillin or amoxicillin/clavulanate is recommended first line. [1] Surgery may occasionally be used in people with chronic disease. [7]
Sleep paralysis is a state, during waking up or falling asleep , in which a person is aware but unable to move or speak. [1] [2] During an episode, one may hallucinate (hear, feel, or see things that are not there), which often results in fear . [1] Episodes generally last less than a couple of minutes. [2] It may occur as a single episode or be recurrent. [1]
The condition may occur in those who are otherwise healthy or those with narcolepsy , or it may run in families as a result of specific genetic changes. [2] The condition can be triggered by sleep deprivation , psychological stress , or abnormal sleep cycles . [2] The underlying mechanism is believed to involve a dysfunction in REM sleep . [2] Sleep paralysis is commonly experienced by lucid dreamers; some lucid dreamers use this as a method of having a lucid dream . [3] Diagnosis is based on a person's description. [2] Other conditions that can present similarly include narcolepsy, atonic seizure , and hypokalemic periodic paralysis . [2]
Treatment options for sleep paralysis have been poorly studied. [1] It is recommended that people be reassured that the condition is common and generally not serious. [1] Other efforts that may be tried include sleep hygiene , cognitive behavioral therapy , and antidepressants . [1]
Somnolence (alternatively " sleepiness " or " drowsiness ") is a state of strong desire for sleep , or sleeping for unusually long periods (compare hypersomnia ). It has distinct meanings and causes. It can refer to the usual state preceding falling asleep , [1] the condition of being in a drowsy state due to circadian rhythm disorders, or a symptom of other health problems. It can be accompanied by lethargy , weakness, and lack of mental agility. [2]
Somnolence is often viewed as a symptom rather than a disorder by itself. However, the concept of somnolence recurring at certain times for certain reasons constitutes various disorders, such as excessive daytime sleepiness , shift work sleep disorder , and others; and there are medical codes for somnolence as viewed as a disorder.
Sleepiness can be dangerous when performing tasks that require constant concentration, such as driving a vehicle. When a person is sufficiently fatigued , microsleeps may be experienced. In individuals deprived of sleep, somnolence may spontaneously dissipate for short periods of time; this phenomenon is the second wind , and results from the normal cycling of the circadian rhythm interfering with the processes the body carries out to prepare itself to rest.

Stevens–Johnson syndrome ( SJS ) is a type of severe skin reaction . [1] Together with toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and Stevens–Johnson/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN), it forms a spectrum of disease , with SJS being less severe. [1] [3] Erythema multiforme (EM) is generally considered a separate condition. [5] Early symptoms of SJS include fever and flu-like symptoms . [1] A few days later, the skin begins to blister and peel, forming painful raw areas. [1] Mucous membranes , such as the mouth, are also typically involved. [1] Complications include dehydration , sepsis , pneumonia and multiple organ failure . [1]
The most common cause is certain medications such as lamotrigine , carbamazepine , allopurinol , sulfonamide antibiotics and nevirapine . [1] Other causes can include infections such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae and cytomegalovirus , or the cause may remain unknown. [2] [1] Risk factors include HIV/AIDS and systemic lupus erythematosus . [1]
Syncope may refer to:

A thought disorder ( TD ) is any disturbance in cognition that adversely affects language and thought content, and thereby communication. [1] [2] A variety of thought disorders were said to be characteristic of people with schizophrenia . [1] A content-thought disorder is typically characterised by the experience of multiple delusional fragments. [3] The term, thought disorder, is often used to refer to a formal thought disorder.
A formal thought disorder ( FTD ) is a disruption of the form or structure of thought. [4] Formal thought disorder, also known as disorganised thinking, results in disorganised speech, and is recognised as a major feature of schizophrenia , and other psychoses . [5] [6] FTD is also associated with conditions including mood disorders , dementia , mania , and neurological diseases . [7] [5]

Tinnitus is the perception of sound when no corresponding external sound is present. [1] Nearly everyone will experience a faint "normal tinnitus" in a completely quiet room but it is only of concern if it is bothersome or interferes with normal hearing or correlated with other problems. [6] While often described as a ringing, it may also sound like a clicking, buzzing, hiss, or roaring. [2] The sound may be soft or loud, low or high pitched , and often appears to be coming from one or both ears or from the head itself. [2] In some people, the sound may interfere with concentration and in some cases it is associated with anxiety and depression. [2] Tinnitus is usually associated with some degree of hearing loss and with decreased understanding in noisy environments. [2] It is common, affecting about 10–15% of people. [5] Most, however, tolerate it well, and it is a significant problem in only 1–2% of people. [5] The word tinnitus comes from the Latin tinnire which means "to ring". [3]
Rather than a disease, tinnitus is a symptom that may result from various underlying causes and can may be generated at any level of the auditory system and structures beyond that system. [2] The most common causes are hearing damage, noise-induced hearing loss or age-related hearing loss, known as presbycusis . [2] Other causes include ear infections , disease of the heart or blood vessels , Ménière's disease , brain tumors , exposure to certain medications, a previous head injury , earwax , and sometimes, the tinnitus is suddenly perceived during a period of emotional stress . [2] [4] It is more common in those with depression. [3]

Vomiting (also known as puking , throwing up , barfing , emesis , among other names) is the involuntary, forceful expulsion of the contents of one's stomach through the mouth and sometimes the nose . [1]
Vomiting can be caused by many conditions; it may be present as a specific response to ailments like gastritis [2] or poisoning , or as a non-specific sequela ranging from brain tumors and elevated intracranial pressure to overexposure to ionizing radiation . The feeling that one is about to vomit is called nausea ; it often precedes, but does not always lead to vomiting. Antiemetics are sometimes necessary to suppress nausea and vomiting. In severe cases, where dehydration develops, intravenous fluid may be required. Self-induced vomiting can be a component of an eating disorder such as bulimia , and is itself now classified as an eating disorder on its own, purging disorder . [3]
