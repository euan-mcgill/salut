Pain is a distressing feeling often caused by intense or damaging stimuli. The International Association for the Study of Pain defines pain as "an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with, or resembling that associated with, actual or potential tissue damage." [1] In medical diagnosis, pain is regarded as a symptom of an underlying condition.
Pain motivates the individual to withdraw from damaging situations, to protect a damaged body part while it heals, and to avoid similar experiences in the future. [2] Most pain resolves once the noxious stimulus is removed and the body has healed, but it may persist despite removal of the stimulus and apparent healing of the body. Sometimes pain arises in the absence of any detectable stimulus, damage or disease. [3]

Abdominal pain , also known as a stomach ache , is a symptom associated with both non-serious and serious medical issues.
Common causes of pain in the abdomen include gastroenteritis and irritable bowel syndrome . [2] About 15% of people have a more serious underlying condition such as appendicitis , leaking or ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm , diverticulitis , or ectopic pregnancy . [2] In a third of cases the exact cause is unclear. [2]

An anesthetic ( American English ) or anaesthetic ( British English ; see spelling differences ) is a drug used to induce anesthesia ⁠— ⁠in other words, to result in a temporary loss of sensation or awareness . They may be divided into two broad classes: general anesthetics , which result in a reversible loss of consciousness , and local anesthetics , which cause a reversible loss of sensation for a limited region of the body without necessarily affecting consciousness.
A wide variety of drugs are used in modern anesthetic practice.  Many are rarely used outside anesthesiology , but others are used commonly in various fields of healthcare. Combinations of anesthetics are sometimes used for their synergistic and additive therapeutic effects. Adverse effects, however, may also be increased. [1] Anesthetics are distinct from analgesics , which block only sensation of painful stimuli.

Fibromyalgia ( FM ) is a medical condition characterized by chronic widespread pain and a heightened pain response to pressure . [3] Other symptoms include tiredness to a degree that normal activities are affected, sleep problems and troubles with memory . [4] Some people also report restless legs syndrome , bowel or bladder problems , numbness and tingling and sensitivity to noise, lights or temperature. [5] Fibromyalgia is frequently associated with depression , anxiety and posttraumatic stress disorder . [4] Other types of chronic pain are also frequently present. [4]
The cause of fibromyalgia is unknown; however, it is believed to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors. [4] [5] The condition runs in families and many genes are believed to be involved. [8] Environmental factors may include psychological stress , trauma , and certain infections . [4] The pain appears to result from processes in the central nervous system and the condition is referred to as a "central sensitization syndrome". [3] [4] Fibromyalgia is recognized as a disorder in both the U.S. by the US National Institutes of Health and the American College of Rheumatology , [5] [9] and in Canada by the Canadian Rheumatology Association and the Canadian Pain Society. [10] There is no specific diagnostic test, [5] although as of 2020, several diagnostic blood tests were in the process of moving towards certification and wider use for diagnosing fibromyalgia in conjunction with a physical examination. [11] [12] Nonetheless, all forms of diagnosis involve first ruling out other potential causes and verifying that a set number of symptoms are present. [4] [5]
Headache is the symptom of pain in the face , head , or neck . It can occur as a migraine , tension-type headache , or cluster headache . There is an increased risk of depression in those with severe headaches. [1]
Headaches can occur as a result of many conditions. There are a number of different classification systems for headaches. The most well-recognized is that of the International Headache Society . Causes of headaches may include dehydration, fatigue, sleep deprivation, stress, the effects of medications, the effects of recreational drugs, viral infections, loud noises, common colds, head injury, rapid ingestion of a very cold food or beverage, and dental or sinus issues (such as sinusitis ). [2]
Treatment of a headache depends on the underlying cause, but commonly involves pain medication . A headache is one of the most commonly experienced of all physical discomforts.

Interstitial cystitis ( IC ), also known as bladder pain syndrome ( BPS ), is a type of chronic pain that affects the bladder and pelvic floor. [1] Together with CP/CPPS , it makes up urologic chronic pelvic pain syndrome (UCPPS) . [2] Symptoms include feeling the need to urinate right away , needing to urinate often , and pain with sex . [1] IC/BPS is associated with depression and lower quality of life . [5] Many of those affected also have irritable bowel syndrome and fibromyalgia . [1]
The cause of IC/BPS is unknown. [1] While it can, it does not typically run in a family. [1] The diagnosis is usually based on the symptoms after ruling out other conditions . [5] Typically the urine culture is negative. [5] Ulceration or inflammation may be seen on cystoscopy . [5] Other conditions which can produce similar symptoms include urinary tract infection (UTI), overactive bladder , sexually transmitted infections , endometriosis , bladder cancer , and prostatitis . [1] [6]

Migraine ( UK : / ˈ m iː ɡ r eɪ n / , US : / ˈ m aɪ -/ ) [12] [13] is a primary headache disorder characterized by recurrent headaches that are moderate to severe. [1] Typically, episodes affect one side of the head, are pulsating in nature, and last from a few hours to three days. [1] Associated symptoms may include nausea , vomiting , and sensitivity to light , sound , or smell . [2] The pain is generally made worse by physical activity, [14] although regular exercise may have prophylactic effects. [15] Up to one-third of people affected have aura : typically a short period of visual disturbance that signals that the headache will soon occur. [14] Occasionally, aura can occur with little or no headache following, but not everyone has this symptom. [16]
Migraine is believed to be due to a mixture of environmental and genetic factors. [3] About two-thirds of cases run in families. [5] Changing hormone levels may also play a role, as migraine affects slightly more boys than girls before puberty and two to three times more women than men. [4] [17] The risk of migraine usually decreases during pregnancy and after menopause . [4] [18] The underlying mechanisms are not fully known. [18] They are, however, believed to involve the nerves and blood vessels of the brain. [5]
Myalgia (also called muscle pain and muscle ache ) is the medical term for muscle pain .  Myalgia is a symptom of many diseases . The most common cause of acute myalgia is the overuse of a muscle or group of muscles; another likely cause is viral infection , especially when there has been no trauma. Long-lasting myalgia can be caused by metabolic myopathy , some nutritional deficiencies, and chronic fatigue syndrome .
The most common causes of myalgia are overuse , injury , or strain . However, myalgia can also be caused by diseases, medications, or as a response to a vaccination . Dehydration at times results in muscle pain as well, for people involved in extensive physical activities such as workout. It is also a sign of acute rejection after heart transplant surgery.
The most common causes are:
Neck pain , also known as cervicalgia , is a common problem, with two-thirds of the population having neck pain at some point in their lives. [1]
Neck pain, although felt in the neck , can be caused by numerous other spinal problems. Neck pain may arise due to muscular tightness in both the neck and upper back, or pinching of the nerves emanating from the cervical vertebrae . Joint disruption in the neck creates pain, as does joint disruption in the upper back.
The head is supported by the lower neck and upper back, and it is these areas that commonly cause neck pain. The top three joints in the neck allow for most movement of the neck and head. The lower joints in the neck and those of the upper back create a supportive structure for the head to sit on. If this support system is affected adversely, then the muscles in the area will tighten, leading to neck pain.
Pain disorder is chronic pain experienced by a patient in one or more areas, and is thought to be caused by psychological stress . The pain is often so severe that it disables the patient from proper functioning. Duration may be as short as a few days or as long as many years. The disorder may begin at any age, and occurs more frequently in girls than boys. [1] This disorder often occurs after an accident, during an illness that has caused pain, or after withdrawing from use during drug addiction, which then takes on a 'life' of its own. [2]
Common symptoms of pain disorder are: negative or distorted cognition, such as feelings of despair or hopelessness; inactivity and passivity, in some cases disability; increased pain, sometimes requiring clinical treatment; sleep disturbance and fatigue; disruption of social relationships; depression and anxiety. [3] Acute conditions last less than six months while chronic pain disorder lasts six or more months. [4] There is no neurological or physiological basis for the pain. Pain is reported as more distressing than it should be had there been a physical explanation.
Pain behavior highlights the psychological aspect of pain disorder. This can be demonstrated how moderate pain symptoms become more painful when rewarded in the form of solicitous and attentive behavior of others, by monetary gain, or by the successful avoidance of distasteful activities. [5] The same can be said about excessive worry. A minor physical symptom can be aggravated or become more harmful and threatening if the person suffering engages in a constant body and symptom appraisal, which can lead to stress and maladaptive behavior when coping with the physical symptom. [6]
Sore throat , also known as throat pain , is pain or irritation of the throat . Sore throat is usually caused by a viral infection or a group A streptococcus (GAS) bacterial infection. [1] Other causes include pharyngitis ( inflammation of the throat), tonsillitis (inflammation of the tonsils), or dehydration , which leads to the throat drying up. It can also result from trauma . The majority of sore throats are caused by a virus, for which antibiotics are not helpful. [1] A strong association between antibiotic misuse and antibiotic resistance has been shown. [2]
For sore throat caused by bacteria (GAS), treatment with antibiotics may help the person get better faster, reduce the risk that the bacterial infection does not spread, prevent retropharyngeal abscesses and quinsy , and reduce the risk of other complications such as rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease . [1] In most developed countries , post-streptococcal diseases have become far less common. For this reason, awareness and public health initiatives to promote minimizing the use of antibiotics for viral infections has become the focus. [1]
Approximately 35% of childhood sore throats and 5-25% of adults sore throats are caused by a bacterial infection from group A streptococcus. [1] Sore throats that are "non-group A streptococcus" are assumed to be caused by a viral infection. Sore throat is a common reason for people to visit their primary care doctors and the top reason for antibiotic prescriptions by primary care practitioners such as family doctors. [1] In the United States, about 1% of all visits to the hospital emergency department, physician office and medical clinics, and outpatient clinics are for sore throat (over 7 million visits for adults and 7 million visits for children per year). [1]
Suffering , or pain in a broad sense, [1] may be an experience of unpleasantness and aversion associated with the perception of harm or threat of harm in an individual. [2] Suffering is the basic element that makes up the negative valence of affective phenomena . The opposite of suffering is pleasure or happiness .
Suffering is often categorized as physical [3] or mental. [4] It may come in all degrees of intensity, from mild to intolerable. Factors of duration and frequency of occurrence usually compound that of intensity. Attitudes toward suffering may vary widely, in the sufferer or other people, according to how much it is regarded as avoidable or unavoidable, useful or useless, deserved or undeserved.
Suffering occurs in the lives of sentient beings in numerous manners, often dramatically. As a result, many fields of human activity are concerned with some aspects of suffering. These aspects may include the nature of suffering, its processes, its origin and causes, its meaning and significance, its related personal, social, and cultural behaviors, [5] its remedies, management, and uses.
Tension headache , also known as stress headache , or tension-type headache (TTH), is the most common type of primary headache . The pain can radiate from the lower back of the head, the neck, eyes or other muscle groups in the body typically affecting both sides of the head. Tension-type headaches account for nearly 90% of all headaches.
Pain medication, such as aspirin and ibuprofen , are effective for the treatment of tension headache. [1] [2] Tricyclic antidepressants appear to be useful for prevention. [3] Evidence is poor for SSRIs , propranolol and muscle relaxants . [4] [5]
As of 2016, tension headaches affect about 1.89 billion people [6] and are more common in women than men (23% to 18% respectively). [7]

Toothache , also known as dental pain , [3] is pain in the teeth or their supporting structures, caused by dental diseases or pain referred to the teeth by non-dental diseases. When severe it may impact sleep, eating, and other daily activities.
Common causes include inflammation of the pulp , (usually in response to tooth decay , dental trauma , or other factors), dentin hypersensitivity , apical periodontitis (inflammation of the periodontal ligament and alveolar bone around the root apex), dental abscesses (localized collections of pus ), alveolar osteitis ("dry socket", a possible complication of tooth extraction ), acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (a gum infection), and temporomandibular disorder .
