SARS coronavirus 2 ( SARS-CoV-2 ) is a positive-sense , single-stranded RNA coronavirus which causes the disease COVID-19 . [2] It used to be known as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by the World Health Organization (WHO). [3] [4]
The virus started the 2019–20 coronavirus outbreak . [5] [6] [7] The first suspected cases were reported to the WHO on December 31, 2019. [8] [9] Many early cases of this new coronavirus were linked to Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, a large seafood and animal market in Wuhan , China. The virus may have come from infected animals. It is not certain that this place was the source of the pandemic . [10]
The genetic material of this virus showed many similarities to SARS-CoV (79.5%) [11] and bat coronaviruses (96%). [11] This means the virus may have originally come from bats . [12] [13] [14] Scientists did more experiments that showed the virus probably went from bats to an intermediate host , meaning another animal in between bats and humans.  The viruses in that other animal changed over time until they could infect humans.  Scientists are close to sure that the original animal was a bat but not sure what the intermediate animal was. [15] Some scientists think it could have been a pangolin because there are coronaviruses that live in pangolins even though they are not exactly the same as SARS-CoV-2 or the ones in bats. [16] Pangolins are an endangered species and buying, selling or moving them from place to place is illegal in China and many other countries.  But their scales are an ingredient in many traditional Chinese medicines , so they are often sold on the black market . [17]
Although SARS-CoV-2 began in bats, scientists noticed that the bats do not get sick and die from it.  They think this is because the bats have very careful immune systems that fight the virus without causing inflammation .  Scientists are studying bats because of this. [18] [19]
Scientists are still looking at SARS-CoV-2 infection in animals, but only a variant strain has been confirmed to spread to minks which has become a huge problem worldwide. [20] It is also inducing fear in humans as there are cases being reported of transmission of COVID-19 from minks to humans. [21] Cats, dogs and other mammals are said to at relative risk but how they can get infected is still a mystery. [22]
In early February 2020, the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses' Coronavirus Study Group gave SARS-CoV-2 its official name, for sudden acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus number two. Before that, people called the virus "2019-nCoV," for "novel (new) coronavirus that appeared in 2019." The study group chose this name because the new virus was so similar to another virus that was already called SARS-CoV with no number. [23] [24]
First, the virus enters the cell with the help of the S protein or spike protein expressed on the surface of the virus beyond its envelope. [25] The spike protein attaches to the human cell receptor hACE2 or  human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 . ACE2 is found on the cells of the epithelial cell linings of the lungs, kidneys, and intestines. [26] After the attachment of the S- protein to the virus, the S protein splits into its two components- S1 head and S2 stalk . The S1 head is now able to bind to the TMPRSS2 receptor which is a serine protease enzyme containing a transmembrane domain. The interaction of TMPRSS2 and S1 trigger the cell membrane of the human cell to merge with that of the virus leading to viral genome entry into cells via endosomes. [27] [28] The viral genome in the endosomes which convert to lysosomes is then processed by cathepsin , which is then replicated in the human cells and released after viral packaging and maturation in the cells to infect others. In October 2020, scientists said they had seen SARS-CoV-2 use another receptor, Neuropilin-1 , to enter cells with the help of the furin cleavage site in its genome which was not found in any of its previous ancestors. [27] [29] [30]
SARS-CoV-2 can infect many kinds of cells, but it mostly infects cells in the respiratory system, such as the cells of the nose, pharynx and lungs.  Because it is in cells inside the nose, it can spread via aerosol or droplets when people breathe, talk, cough or sneeze. [30]
The expanding part of the lungs, pulmonary alveoli , have two main types of cells. One cell, type I , absorbs oxygen from the air, i.e. gas exchange . The other, type II , produces surfactants , that help keep the lungs fluid, clean, infection free, etc. COVID-19 finds a way into a surfactant producing type II cell, and smothers it by reproducing COVID-19 virus within it. Each type II cell which is killed by the virus causes an extreme reaction in the lungs. Fluids, pus, and dead cell material flood the lung, causing the coronavirus pulmonary disease. [31]
Scientists looked at the lungs from people who died of COVID-19. They compared them to lungs from people who died of influenza A and to lungs from people who died but not from any problem with their lungs.  They saw the cells that made up the skins of the blood vessels in the lungs were more badly damaged in the lungs from COVID-19 patients, and there was more blood clotting.  The most important difference the scientists saw was that the lungs had begun to grow new blood vessels . [32] [33]
In February 2020, the World Health Organization announced they had chosen a name for the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2: COVID-19. "Covi" for "coronavirus," "D" for "disease," and "19" for the year 2019.  They said they did not want the name to have any person, place, or animal in it, like "Wuhan," or “pangolin,” because then people might blame the disease on that place, person, or animal.  They also wanted the name to be easy to say out loud. [2]
According to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, COVID-19 makes people feel sick in different ways, but it usually affects the lungs.  People usually cough and have difficulty breathing.  They often also have a fever, chills, headache, pain in their muscles, or trouble tasting or smelling things. [34]
According to an April 2020 study by the American Gastroenterological Association, COVID-19 can make sick people vomit or have diarrhea but this is rare.  They said about 7.7% of COVID-19 patients threw up, about 7.8% had diarrhea and about 3.6% had pain in their stomachs. [35]
A study from the University of Arizona found that SARS-CoV-2 can prevent an infected person from feeling pain.  It does this by giving off vascular endothelial growth factor-A, which binds to the human body's neuropilin receptor .  This way, sick people do not feel pain, do not know they are sick, and spread the virus more than if they could feel pain. [36]
The SARS-CoV-2 virus looks like a round ball with spikes all around it. There are four parts to the virus: the spikes, a membrane, an envelope, and the virus' genetic material, or ribonucleic acid (RNA)  Each of these four parts is a different protein molecule. The spikes, membrane, and envelope are together called the viral envelope , or outer layer, of the virus. [37] [38]
SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-strand RNA virus, meaning that it uses ribonucleic acid (RNA) to hold the patterns to make the proteins it needs instead of using DNA the way humans and other multicellular living things do. [39]
In early 2020, some people began to think that the SARS-CoV-2 may have been made on purpose in a laboratory at the Wuhan Institute of Virology and released in Wuhan like a weapon.  When the leader of Iran , Ayatollah Khamenei , said that he did not want the United States to help his country against coronavirus, he named the idea that Americans had made the virus on purpose to harm Iranains as one of his reasons: "I do not know how real this accusation is but when it exists, who in their right mind would trust you to bring them medication?" said Khamenei. [40]
One survey by Pew Research showed 29% of Americans who answered thought SARS-CoV-2 could have been made in a lab on purpose and 23% thought it could have been made in a lab by accident. [41] A survey of people in the United Kingdom showed many of them thought COVID-19 was caused by 5G wireless networks. [42]
On March 17, 2020, scientists from Columbia University and other places published a paper in Nature Medicine showing that SARS-CoV-2 was almost surely not made by humans in a laboratory.  They did this by comparing the genomes of different viruses to each other. [16] The scientists saw that SARS-CoV-2 did not match any of the viral backbones that already exist for virologists to use. [43] The paper in Nature Medicine soon became one of the most cited scientific papers of all time. [16]
There are no fixed cures for the treatment of COVID-19,  but there are various drugs that have been approved for use such as Hydroxychloroquine and Remdesivir which are detailed below. Other antiviral drugs, interferon therapy and combination of anti-viral and interferons are also being experimented on to get the best possible outcome for patients. These treatments are used to reduce the symptoms and to keep the patients comfortable. [44] [45]
In April 2020, scientists from the University of Pittsburgh said they had made a vaccine, called PittCoVacc and tested it in mice. [46] [47]
Another team of scientists led by Dr. Josef Penninger of the University of British Columbia invented a medicine called  APN01 and tested it in engineered human tissue, meaning human cells put together in a lab to look and act like they were inside a body. The scientists learned that adding human soluble recombinant angiotensin  converting  enzyme 2 (ACE2) to these tissues infected with SARS-CoV-2 made it harder for the virus to reproduce. [48] [49]
In late April 2020, a team from Oxford University announced that they had developed a COVID-19 vaccine.  The United States National Institutes of health tested it in rhesus monkeys, and it worked.  The Oxford scientists said because they had already been working on a vaccine against a different coronavirus, they had a head start working on one for SARS-CoV-2.  The scientists said they would try to test their vaccine on 6000 people by the end of May 2020, and that their vaccine could be ready for people to use in September 2020. [50] [51]
In mid-May 2020, a company called Moderna said they tested their mRNA vaccine in forty-five people and eight of them produced antibodies [52] but they did not publish the specific data or publish an article in a scientific journal. [53] Anna Durbin of Johns Hopkins University said it was too soon to tell if people would keep the antibodies long enough for the vaccine to work. [54] The United States Food and Drug Administration gave Moderna permission to test the vaccine again in more people.  Moderna's chief medical officer said the vaccine could be ready in January 2021. [52]
Some people think hydroxychloroquine , a medicine given to people with malaria, lupus, and arthritis, could work against COVID-19 and some do not.  One study from China showed that COVID-19 patients who took hydroxychloroquine got better faster, but the study was not peer reviewed .  Other studies in France and China seemed to show hydroxychloroquine helped, but the studies did not include control groups, meaning the doctors did not compare patients who took hydroxychloroquine to patients who did not, so they could not be sure it was the hydroxychloroquine that was helping them or whether it was something else. [55] In March, the United States Food and Drug Administration gave doctors permission to give hydroxychloroquine to COVID-19 patients. [56]
United States President Donald Trump suggested the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine could help cure COVID-19, but Dr. Anthony Fauci , who is part of the White House 's official coronavirus team said no one could know if hydroxychloroquine worked against SARS-CoV-2.  In early April, the New York Times reported that President Trump has "a small personal financial interest" in Sanofi, one of the companies that makes hydroxychloroquine, meaning that if the company sold more hydroxychloroquine, he would have more wealth. [56]
In early April, Fauci said, "The data are really just at best suggestive. There have been cases that show there may be an effect and there are others to show there's no effect." [57] Dr. Megan L. Ranney of Brown University said that hydroxychloroquine can cause heart attacks and other problems.  Other doctors worry that if people take hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19, there will not be enough left for people with malaria, lupus, and arthritis.  Still, some hospitals have given hydroxychloroquine to COVID-19 patients who are very sick because the doctors think it is worth the risk. [55]
Scientists in France and China performed more studies on larger groups of patients taking hydroxychloroquine.  They watched patients who were taking the medicine and other treatment together and at patients who were only taking the other treatment.  Both studies showed that hydroxychloroquine did not help and did cause side effects.  Both studies were published in May 2020. [58]
Some scientists thought the drug remdesivir, which was invented as a medicine for Ebola , could work against SARS-CoV-2.  Remdesivir works against some viruses.  Remdesivir had already been tested in humans, so the doctors already knew it would not hurt the patients even if it did not make them better.  Because scientists already knew remdesivir was safe, they were able to start testing it in humans right away. [59] [60]
In one study, doctors gave a drug called remdesivir to 61 COVID-19 patients on a compassionate basis, meaning they gave them the drug because there was no other treatment available.  Scientists studied 53 of these patients and found that 68% of the patients got better, 13% died, and 25% had serious side effects.  But because the study had no control group, meaning these patients were not compared to other COVID-19 patients who were not taking remdesivir, and because only 53 people were in the experiment, scientists must run more studies before they can be sure remdesivir works. [59] [60]
The chairman and CEO of the company that makes remdesivir, David O'Day, said that remdesivir might work better in some patients than in others and asked scientists to perform many different kinds of studies. [59] [60]
In October 2020, the National Institutes of Health told the world the results of its tests: They studied 11,000 people and found that remdesivir did not help keep COVID-19 patients alive. [61]
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic , also called the coronavirus pandemic , is a current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). [1] [6] [b] The outbreak started in Wuhan , Hubei , China, in December 2019. The World Health Organization (WHO) called it a pandemic on 11 March 2020. [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses gave the virus its name. As of February 19, 2021, more than 110 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in more than 188 countries and territories. More than two million people have died of COVID-19, [12] and more than 85 million people have defeated, or recovered from the disease. [12] [13] [14]
The virus usually moves from one person to another with small drops made when coughing [15] [16] or sneezing . [17] It mostly spreads when people are close to each other, which is why social distancing is encouraged. Coronavirus can also spread when people touch a surface with the virus, and then they touch their face. [16] [17] Common symptoms include fever , cough, and trouble breathing. [18] The illness can worsen with pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome . [19] As of January 2021, a number of vaccines for COVID-19 have been developed, but only a few have been approved as safe for use. The first vaccine to be approved was created by Pfizer and BioNTech , [20] followed by the Oxford / AstraZeneca [21] vaccine. Vaccine distribution has begun in many countries in Europe, North America, South America and Asia. [22] The United Kingdom was the first western country to administer a COVID-19 vaccine. [23] No antiviral medicine for COVID-19 is available. [24] Doctors usually give patients supportive therapy instead. [25] People can avoid spreading the virus by regularly washing their hands, covering their mouth when coughing, maintaining distance from other people , staying away from crowds, wearing medical or cloth face coverings, and being alone for people who think they are infected, also known as quarantining . [24]
The outbreak might be from a coronavirus that usually lives in bats . This infected another animal, possibly a pangolin . It then changed inside that other animal until it could infect humans. [26] It originated at a wet market Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market and is linked to China’s wild animal meat trade. Live foxes , crocodiles , wolf pups, giant salamanders , snakes , rats , peacocks , porcupines , koalas and game meats were on the menu at the market. [27] A 55-year-old person from Hubei province was the first human to contract the virus on November 17, 2019. [28] A 61-year-old man who was a regular customer at the market was the first person to die from the virus on January 11, 2020. [29] The exact origin of the virus is still unknown since the market in Wuhan sold a variety of live wild animals in cages. Chinese tourists have spread the virus by traveling to other countries and made it a worldwide pandemic. [30]
Racism and xenophobia against Chinese people and Asians increased during the pandemic.
In November 2020, two companies, Pfizer and Moderna , said they had finished making COVID-19 vaccines . Both are over 90% effective. Two mRNA vaccines, one by Pfizer and one by Moderna, have been tested. Both were over 90% effective. [31] Countries began planning to give the vaccine to many people. [32] [33] [34]
The United States had the most deaths from the virus. More than 600,000 Americans died from the virus. [35] California had the most COVID-19 cases in the country. [36] Los Angeles was the most infected city.
Epidemiology is the study of how diseases affect the health and illness of groups of people.
On 31 December 2019, Chinese health authorities reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) a cluster of viral pneumonia cases of unknown cause in Wuhan , [37] [38] and an investigation was launched in early January 2020. [39]
On 9 June 2020, a Harvard University study suggested that COVID-19 may have been spreading in China as early as August 2019, based on hospital car park usage and web search trends. [40]
Cases means the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and have tested positive. [41] These cases are according to Johns Hopkins University .
Most people who contract COVID-19 recover. For those who do not, the time between the start of symptoms and death usually ranges from 6 to 41 days, but most of the time about 14 days. [42] This data are recorded by the WHO .
On 11 March 2020, the WHO said that the pandemic could be controlled. [7]
According to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, COVID-19 makes people feel sick in different ways, but it usually affects the lungs. People usually cough and have difficulty breathing. They often also have a fever , chills, headache , pain in their muscles, or trouble tasting or smelling things, [44] which can often be confused with the flu virus. [45]
According to an April 2020 study by the American Gastroenterological Association, COVID-19 can make sick people vomit or have diarrhea , but this is rare. They said about 7.7% of COVID-19 patients vomited , about 7.8% had diarrhea and about 3.6% had pain in their stomachs. [46]

In February 2020, the WHO announced a name for the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2: COVID-19. It replaced the name "2019-nCoV." [393] "Covi" is for "coronavirus," "D" for "disease," and "19" for the year 2019-- the year it was first detected. They said they did not want the name to have any person, place, or animal in it because people might blame the disease on that place, person, or animal. For example, it did not use the word "Wuhan." They also wanted the name to be easy to say out loud. [394]
According to an article in Market Watch dated on February 27, 2020, the overall case mortality rate in China was 2.3%. However, these results might be severely different between different age groups and between men and women. People over the age of 70 experienced a rate of mortality 4-5 times that of the average. Men were more likely to die than women (2.8% versus 1.7% for women) possibly due to lifestyle, such as it being more possible in men to drink and smoke, making the risk of having a respiratory illness more possible, and thus more vulnerable. [395] These numbers were the conclusion of a study by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention using 72,314 COVID-19 cases in mainland China as of Feb. 11. At that point this was the largest sample of cases for such a study. [396]
On March 5, 2020, the WHO released the case fatality rate. [397]
COVID-19 did not affect everyone in each country the same way. [398] As of May 2020, APM Research Lab said the death rate among black Americans was 2.4 times as high as for white Americans and 2.2 times as high as for Latino and Asian Americans. [399] In July 2020, The New York Times printed data from the Centers for Disease Control showing that black and Latino Americans were three times as likely to become sick and twice as likely to die as white Americans. This was not only in large cities but also in rural areas. This was not only for old people but for people in all age groups. Native Americans were also more likely than whites to become sick and die. Asian Americans were 1.3 times as likely as whites to become sick. [400]
Camara Jones, an epidemiologist who once worked for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said this was socioeconomic and not because of any natural difference in black and white people's bodies. [401] In the United States, black citizens are more likely to work jobs where they serve the public directly and to ride on public transport rather than take their own cars to work.  This makes them more likely to be infected than people who work in private offices or from home. Sharrelle Barber, an epidemiologist and biostatistician from Drexel University , also said black Americans can live in crowded neighborhoods where social distancing is harder to do and healthy food harder to find. [402] Both Barber and Jones blamed the long history of racism in the United States for these things. Three senators, Kamala Harris , Cory Booker and Elizabeth Warren said the federal government should start recording the race of COVID-19 patients so scientists could study this problem. [402]
In June, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) told the public that people using the United States' government's Medicare health program had different results depending on race. Four times as many black Medicare patients went to hospitals for COVID-19 than white Medicare patients. There were twice as many hospitalized Hispanic patients than white patients. There were three hospitalized Asian patients for every two hospitalized white patients. The head of CMS, Seema Verma, said this was mostly because of socioeconomic status. [403]
In the United Kingdom, twice as many black COVID-19 patients died as white COVID-19 patients. Other non-white people, like people from India and Bangladesh, were also more likely to die of COVID-19 than whites. Britain's Office of National Statistics said that the differences in money and education explained some of this difference but not all of it. They also said they did not know whether non-white patients caught COVID-19 more often or whether they caught more severe cases. Only female Chinese Britons were less likely to die of COVID-19 than white Britons. [404]
Native Americans in the United States have shown more deaths from COVID-19 than the rest of the U.S. [405] As of May, the Navajo Nation had 88 deaths and 2,757 cases, and the money they had been promised by the government arrived several weeks late. Only 30% of the people in the Navajo Nation have pipes with running water, which made it difficult for people to wash their hands. [406]
Scientists from Chapman University made a plan to protect the Tsimane people in Bolivia from COVID-19 and said this plan would also work for other indigenous peoples living on their own land. The scientists said that many indigenous peoples have problems that make COVID-19 more dangerous for them, like poverty, less clean water, and other lung diseases. Hospitals may be a long distance away, and racism can affect the way doctors and nurses react. But they also sometimes have things that help, like traditions of making decisions together and the ability to grow food nearby. [405] The scientists found people who spoke the Tsimane language as a first language and made teams to go to Tsimane towns to warn them about COVID-19. They also used radio stations. They said the best plan was for whole communities to decide to isolate. They found this worked well because the Tsimane already usually made their big decisions together as a community in special meetings and already had a tradition of quarantining new mothers. The Chapman scientists said their plan would also work for other indigenous peoples who also make decisions together, like the Tsimane. [407] [405] The Waswanipi Cree in Canada, the Mapoon people in Australia, and many groups in South America already tried plans like these on their own. [405] [408]
In May 2020, police officers in Minneapolis, Minnesota killed an unarmed black man called George Floyd while they were arresting him. There were weeks of protests all over the world against police brutality and racism. Experts said they were worried protesters and police could spread SARS-CoV-2 to each other. Other experts said some of the reasons that the protests were so big was because non-white people were being killed by COVID-19 more than white people were, because poor leadership in the COVID-19 crisis reminded them of poor leadership about racism, and because the lockdowns shut down workplaces and other things. This meant people had more time to protest. [408] [409] [410] [411]
African Americans are more likely to die from the virus compared to other people in the United States . [412]
Romani people (Gypsies) in Europe were hard-hit by COVID-19. [413]
In early 2020, some people began to think that the SARS-CoV-2 may have been made on purpose in a laboratory and either released by accident or on purpose like a weapon. Some Iranians thought the Americans might have made it. [414] Chinese state media said COVID-19 came from the United States to China and not the other way around. [415] Some Americans thought the Chinese might have made it. [416] Some Britons thought it might have been created by accident by 5G cell phone networks. [417]
On March 17, 2020, scientists from Columbia University and other places published a paper in Nature Medicine showing that SARS-CoV-2 was almost surely not made by humans in a laboratory. They did this by comparing the genomes of different viruses to each other. [26] The scientists saw that SARS-CoV-2 did not match any of the viral backbones that already exist for virologists to use. [418] Within a few weeks, it became one of the most cited scientific papers in history, meaning that other scientists were reading and using it.

On December 31, 2019, China alerted WHO to several cases of unusual pneumonia in Wuhan , Hubei province. [421]
On January 20, 2020, Chinese premier Li Keqiang called for efforts to stop and control the pneumonia epidemic caused by a novel coronavirus. [422] As of February 5, 2020, 24,588 cases have been confirmed, [423] [424] including in every province-level division of China . [423] A larger number of people may have been infected, but not detected (especially mild cases). [425] [426] The first local transmission of the virus outside China occurred in Vietnam between family members, [427] while the first local transmission not involving family occurred in Germany, on January 22, when a German man contracted the disease from a Chinese business visitor at a meeting. [428] As of 5 February 2020 [update] , 493 deaths have been attributed to the virus since the first confirmed death on January 9, with 990 recoveries. [429] [423] The first death outside China was reported in the Philippines, in a 44-year-old Chinese male on February 1. [430] but another source reported:
"The first cases of COVID-19 outside of China were identified on January 13 in Thailand and on January 16 in Japan". [431]
There has been testing which have showed over 6000 confirmed cases in China, [432] some of whom are healthcare workers. [433] [434]
Confirmed cases have also been reported in Thailand , South Korea , Japan , Taiwan , Macau , Hong Kong , the United States ( Everett, Washington and Chicago ), [434] Singapore , [435] Vietnam , [436] France [437] and Nepal . [438]
The World Health Organization declared that this is a Public Health Emergency of International Concern since January 30, 2020.
Bloomberg News and other business publications have reported several plant closures , travel restrictions , and imposed quarantines as a result of this outbreak. [439]
As of February 10, 2020 there have been 40,235 confirmed cases reported of people infected by the virus in China. Also reported were 909 deaths, and 319 cases in 24 other countries, including one death, according to WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus . [440]
On November 14, 2020, there were 53,853,718 global COVID-19 cases and 1,311,524 deaths with cases in 217 countries and territories. [441]
The pandemic made it more difficult for millions of people all over the world to get enough food. People lost their jobs, so they did not have money to buy food. Farms were shut down, so there was less food made. Processing plants and food factories were shut down, so less food was made ready for people to eat. [497]
In April, Arif Husain of the United Nations' World Food Program said that 130 million more people could go hungry, in addition to the 135 million who were already hungry before the pandemic began. He said that poorer countries would be more affected than rich countries because the way they move raw food from farms to cities and other places where people live is less organized and relies more on human beings than on automatic systems . [497]
This hunger crisis is different from crises in other years because it happened to the whole world at the same time. That meant that people working in other countries could not help by sending money home. [497] [498]
All over the world, children who ate meals at school had less access to food when the schools were shut down. [497]
Scientists from the University of Michigan said the pandemic was making it harder for people to find food. In a study published in May, they said out of of seven Americans over age 50 said they had trouble getting enough food before the pandemic, and it got worse when senior centers that provided meals were closed. [499] Federal and state governments started programs to bring food to older people and children. There were also more food donation drives in towns. [498]
In the United States, nursing homes had some of the highest rates of infection and death,
40% of all COVID-19 deaths in the country. Nursing homes are group homes for old people who need medical care, for disabled people who need medical care, and for people recovering from severe sickness or injury, like stroke patients.
Many people who live in nursing homes pay through the government program Medicaid, which pays less than Medicare or regular insurance companies. In June, many American nursing homes were caught throwing their regular patients out so they could make room for COVID-19 patients who could pay them more. Because nursing homes had stopped allowing visitors, it took longer for them to get caught. United States law requires nursing homes to warn patients 30 days before kicking them out, but the nursing homes did not do this.
Some of the nursing homes took the COVID-19 patients because state governments asked them to and they say they sent their elderly residents away because they were worried they would catch COVID-19 from the sick patients. [500]
Because so many governments told people to stay at home, there was less air pollution than usual for that time of year. Pollution in New York fell by 50% and the use of coal in China fell by 40%. [501] The European Space Agency showed pictures taken from a satellite of China's pollution disappearing during quarantine and coming back when everyone went back to work. [502]
The pandemic and shutdowns made people use less electricity. In the United States, people got less of their electricity from coal power but kept using gas and renewable power like wind and solar power. This was because coal plants are more expensive to run, so power companies used them less. [503]
Pollution from before the pandemic also affected what happened after people became sick. Scientists saw that more people died from COVID-19 in places with large amounts of air pollution. One team of scientists from Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg looked at air pollution information from satellites and statistics on COVID-19 deaths in Italy, France, Germany and Spain and saw that places with large amounts of nitrogen dioxide pollution had more people die from COVID-19. Nitrogen dioxide can damage the lungs. [504] [505]
The shutdowns and social distancing also affected animals. Human beings started staying at home about the same time in the spring when sea turtles like to come on land to lay their eggs. Turtle scientists in the United States and Thailand both reported more nests than usual on seashores in Florida and Phuket. They say it is because people are not coming to the beach or bringing their dogs to the beach and because there are fewer boats in the water nearby. Scientists also say they see more dugong and dolphins . [506] [507] [508] With fewer cars driving down roads, salamanders, frogs, and other amphibians were able to cross them for their spring migration. According to citizen scientists from Big Night Maine, a group that watches amphibians, four amphibians made it across the roads alive for every one amphibian killed by cars. Most years, it is only two to one. [509]
Not all ocean mammals did well. According to marine biologists in Florida, manatee deaths in April and May were 20% higher than in 2019. They say this was because many people decided to go boating because other things to do were closed. [510]
Researchers from the San Diego Zoo Global had the idea for a system that people could use to find dangerous germs before they become pandemics or even before they jump from other animals to humans. They said it was important to watch the wildlife trade, like in the Wuhan wet market. The scientists said that over the past eleven years it has gotten easier and easier to sequence viral genomes, and it does not have to be done by a large lab or by a government any more. The scientists said it would be better to spread the work out among more people. [511] [512]
Avoiding traveling and staying home will greatly reduce your risk from catching COVID-19. Staying home doesn't apply if one is sick and needs medical care. Get enough rest and stay hydrated. [513] Wearing a mask and washing your hands can prevent the virus from spreading. [514] Masks should not be placed on children under 2 years of age, people who have trouble breathing, have a respiratory or other medical condition which renders one unable to wear a mask safely, or anyone who is unable to remove the mask without help. Covering coughs and sneezes also reduce the risk of spreading the virus, but one can infect someone else by touching things with coughed/sneezed-in hands. Making sure not to share drinking glasses, cups and particularly other objects which people will drink or eat out of is important if one assumes they are infected or tested positive in the past. Washing eating utensils and other oral eating objects is preferable and cleaning surfaces or possessions which have been repeatedly touched is also important. These include, according to the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention, phones, remote controls, counters, tabletops, doorknobs, bathroom fixtures, toilets, keyboards, tablets, and bedside tables. Avoiding touching your face, nose, or mouth with your hands. Avoiding public transportation, taxis or taking rides with others can stop one's exposure to the virus. [513] Rumors spread about high doses of Vitamin C preventing COVID-19, but these as of October 14, 2020, there has been no conclusive evidence to support this idea. [515] However, there has been evidence pointing to the fact that dosing patients with Vitamin C, either through mouth or IV can reduce time on mechanical ventilators for seriously ill patients by 14%. [516] Drinking tea such as black tea and green tea can inhibit the virus. [517] Staying home for the holidays , having a small gathering of close friends and family members who are consistently taking measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and celebrating virtually through social media can prevent being infected by the virus. Airports, bus stations, train stations, public transport, gas stations, and rest stops are all places travelers can be exposed to catching the virus. [518] Eating a healthy diet that is high in fruits and vegetables, getting rest and sleep, exercising, consuming raw honey, probiotics, garlic, mushrooms and elderberry can boost the immune system. [519] Playing video games to pass time during quarantine can prevent the virus from spreading. [520] Flavanols and proanthocyanidins which are chemicals found in dark chocolate , grapes and green tea may block SARS-CoV-2 proteins. [521] Places you are most likely to catch the virus are churches, hair and nail salons, cruise ships, hospitals and the doctor’s office, restaurants and bars, theaters, sporting events, concert venues, buses, restrooms, elevators, the gym, airplanes, hotels, public swimming pools, nightclubs and the beach. [522] Vaccinated people still need to wear a mask. [523] Flying in a private jet can prevent the spread of coronavirus. [524]

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic , also called the coronavirus pandemic , is a current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). [1] [6] [b] The outbreak started in Wuhan , Hubei , China, in December 2019. The World Health Organization (WHO) called it a pandemic on 11 March 2020. [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses gave the virus its name. As of February 19, 2021, more than 110 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in more than 188 countries and territories. More than two million people have died of COVID-19, [12] and more than 85 million people have defeated, or recovered from the disease. [12] [13] [14]
The virus usually moves from one person to another with small drops made when coughing [15] [16] or sneezing . [17] It mostly spreads when people are close to each other, which is why social distancing is encouraged. Coronavirus can also spread when people touch a surface with the virus, and then they touch their face. [16] [17] Common symptoms include fever , cough, and trouble breathing. [18] The illness can worsen with pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome . [19] As of January 2021, a number of vaccines for COVID-19 have been developed, but only a few have been approved as safe for use. The first vaccine to be approved was created by Pfizer and BioNTech , [20] followed by the Oxford / AstraZeneca [21] vaccine. Vaccine distribution has begun in many countries in Europe, North America, South America and Asia. [22] The United Kingdom was the first western country to administer a COVID-19 vaccine. [23] No antiviral medicine for COVID-19 is available. [24] Doctors usually give patients supportive therapy instead. [25] People can avoid spreading the virus by regularly washing their hands, covering their mouth when coughing, maintaining distance from other people , staying away from crowds, wearing medical or cloth face coverings, and being alone for people who think they are infected, also known as quarantining . [24]
The outbreak might be from a coronavirus that usually lives in bats . This infected another animal, possibly a pangolin . It then changed inside that other animal until it could infect humans. [26] It originated at a wet market Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market and is linked to China’s wild animal meat trade. Live foxes , crocodiles , wolf pups, giant salamanders , snakes , rats , peacocks , porcupines , koalas and game meats were on the menu at the market. [27] A 55-year-old person from Hubei province was the first human to contract the virus on November 17, 2019. [28] A 61-year-old man who was a regular customer at the market was the first person to die from the virus on January 11, 2020. [29] The exact origin of the virus is still unknown since the market in Wuhan sold a variety of live wild animals in cages. Chinese tourists have spread the virus by traveling to other countries and made it a worldwide pandemic. [30]
Racism and xenophobia against Chinese people and Asians increased during the pandemic.
In November 2020, two companies, Pfizer and Moderna , said they had finished making COVID-19 vaccines . Both are over 90% effective. Two mRNA vaccines, one by Pfizer and one by Moderna, have been tested. Both were over 90% effective. [31] Countries began planning to give the vaccine to many people. [32] [33] [34]
The United States had the most deaths from the virus. More than 600,000 Americans died from the virus. [35] California had the most COVID-19 cases in the country. [36] Los Angeles was the most infected city.
Epidemiology is the study of how diseases affect the health and illness of groups of people.
On 31 December 2019, Chinese health authorities reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) a cluster of viral pneumonia cases of unknown cause in Wuhan , [37] [38] and an investigation was launched in early January 2020. [39]
On 9 June 2020, a Harvard University study suggested that COVID-19 may have been spreading in China as early as August 2019, based on hospital car park usage and web search trends. [40]
Cases means the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and have tested positive. [41] These cases are according to Johns Hopkins University .
Most people who contract COVID-19 recover. For those who do not, the time between the start of symptoms and death usually ranges from 6 to 41 days, but most of the time about 14 days. [42] This data are recorded by the WHO .
On 11 March 2020, the WHO said that the pandemic could be controlled. [7]
According to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, COVID-19 makes people feel sick in different ways, but it usually affects the lungs. People usually cough and have difficulty breathing. They often also have a fever , chills, headache , pain in their muscles, or trouble tasting or smelling things, [44] which can often be confused with the flu virus. [45]
According to an April 2020 study by the American Gastroenterological Association, COVID-19 can make sick people vomit or have diarrhea , but this is rare. They said about 7.7% of COVID-19 patients vomited , about 7.8% had diarrhea and about 3.6% had pain in their stomachs. [46]

In February 2020, the WHO announced a name for the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2: COVID-19. It replaced the name "2019-nCoV." [393] "Covi" is for "coronavirus," "D" for "disease," and "19" for the year 2019-- the year it was first detected. They said they did not want the name to have any person, place, or animal in it because people might blame the disease on that place, person, or animal. For example, it did not use the word "Wuhan." They also wanted the name to be easy to say out loud. [394]
According to an article in Market Watch dated on February 27, 2020, the overall case mortality rate in China was 2.3%. However, these results might be severely different between different age groups and between men and women. People over the age of 70 experienced a rate of mortality 4-5 times that of the average. Men were more likely to die than women (2.8% versus 1.7% for women) possibly due to lifestyle, such as it being more possible in men to drink and smoke, making the risk of having a respiratory illness more possible, and thus more vulnerable. [395] These numbers were the conclusion of a study by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention using 72,314 COVID-19 cases in mainland China as of Feb. 11. At that point this was the largest sample of cases for such a study. [396]
On March 5, 2020, the WHO released the case fatality rate. [397]
COVID-19 did not affect everyone in each country the same way. [398] As of May 2020, APM Research Lab said the death rate among black Americans was 2.4 times as high as for white Americans and 2.2 times as high as for Latino and Asian Americans. [399] In July 2020, The New York Times printed data from the Centers for Disease Control showing that black and Latino Americans were three times as likely to become sick and twice as likely to die as white Americans. This was not only in large cities but also in rural areas. This was not only for old people but for people in all age groups. Native Americans were also more likely than whites to become sick and die. Asian Americans were 1.3 times as likely as whites to become sick. [400]
Camara Jones, an epidemiologist who once worked for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said this was socioeconomic and not because of any natural difference in black and white people's bodies. [401] In the United States, black citizens are more likely to work jobs where they serve the public directly and to ride on public transport rather than take their own cars to work.  This makes them more likely to be infected than people who work in private offices or from home. Sharrelle Barber, an epidemiologist and biostatistician from Drexel University , also said black Americans can live in crowded neighborhoods where social distancing is harder to do and healthy food harder to find. [402] Both Barber and Jones blamed the long history of racism in the United States for these things. Three senators, Kamala Harris , Cory Booker and Elizabeth Warren said the federal government should start recording the race of COVID-19 patients so scientists could study this problem. [402]
In June, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) told the public that people using the United States' government's Medicare health program had different results depending on race. Four times as many black Medicare patients went to hospitals for COVID-19 than white Medicare patients. There were twice as many hospitalized Hispanic patients than white patients. There were three hospitalized Asian patients for every two hospitalized white patients. The head of CMS, Seema Verma, said this was mostly because of socioeconomic status. [403]
In the United Kingdom, twice as many black COVID-19 patients died as white COVID-19 patients. Other non-white people, like people from India and Bangladesh, were also more likely to die of COVID-19 than whites. Britain's Office of National Statistics said that the differences in money and education explained some of this difference but not all of it. They also said they did not know whether non-white patients caught COVID-19 more often or whether they caught more severe cases. Only female Chinese Britons were less likely to die of COVID-19 than white Britons. [404]
Native Americans in the United States have shown more deaths from COVID-19 than the rest of the U.S. [405] As of May, the Navajo Nation had 88 deaths and 2,757 cases, and the money they had been promised by the government arrived several weeks late. Only 30% of the people in the Navajo Nation have pipes with running water, which made it difficult for people to wash their hands. [406]
Scientists from Chapman University made a plan to protect the Tsimane people in Bolivia from COVID-19 and said this plan would also work for other indigenous peoples living on their own land. The scientists said that many indigenous peoples have problems that make COVID-19 more dangerous for them, like poverty, less clean water, and other lung diseases. Hospitals may be a long distance away, and racism can affect the way doctors and nurses react. But they also sometimes have things that help, like traditions of making decisions together and the ability to grow food nearby. [405] The scientists found people who spoke the Tsimane language as a first language and made teams to go to Tsimane towns to warn them about COVID-19. They also used radio stations. They said the best plan was for whole communities to decide to isolate. They found this worked well because the Tsimane already usually made their big decisions together as a community in special meetings and already had a tradition of quarantining new mothers. The Chapman scientists said their plan would also work for other indigenous peoples who also make decisions together, like the Tsimane. [407] [405] The Waswanipi Cree in Canada, the Mapoon people in Australia, and many groups in South America already tried plans like these on their own. [405] [408]
In May 2020, police officers in Minneapolis, Minnesota killed an unarmed black man called George Floyd while they were arresting him. There were weeks of protests all over the world against police brutality and racism. Experts said they were worried protesters and police could spread SARS-CoV-2 to each other. Other experts said some of the reasons that the protests were so big was because non-white people were being killed by COVID-19 more than white people were, because poor leadership in the COVID-19 crisis reminded them of poor leadership about racism, and because the lockdowns shut down workplaces and other things. This meant people had more time to protest. [408] [409] [410] [411]
African Americans are more likely to die from the virus compared to other people in the United States . [412]
Romani people (Gypsies) in Europe were hard-hit by COVID-19. [413]
In early 2020, some people began to think that the SARS-CoV-2 may have been made on purpose in a laboratory and either released by accident or on purpose like a weapon. Some Iranians thought the Americans might have made it. [414] Chinese state media said COVID-19 came from the United States to China and not the other way around. [415] Some Americans thought the Chinese might have made it. [416] Some Britons thought it might have been created by accident by 5G cell phone networks. [417]
On March 17, 2020, scientists from Columbia University and other places published a paper in Nature Medicine showing that SARS-CoV-2 was almost surely not made by humans in a laboratory. They did this by comparing the genomes of different viruses to each other. [26] The scientists saw that SARS-CoV-2 did not match any of the viral backbones that already exist for virologists to use. [418] Within a few weeks, it became one of the most cited scientific papers in history, meaning that other scientists were reading and using it.

On December 31, 2019, China alerted WHO to several cases of unusual pneumonia in Wuhan , Hubei province. [421]
On January 20, 2020, Chinese premier Li Keqiang called for efforts to stop and control the pneumonia epidemic caused by a novel coronavirus. [422] As of February 5, 2020, 24,588 cases have been confirmed, [423] [424] including in every province-level division of China . [423] A larger number of people may have been infected, but not detected (especially mild cases). [425] [426] The first local transmission of the virus outside China occurred in Vietnam between family members, [427] while the first local transmission not involving family occurred in Germany, on January 22, when a German man contracted the disease from a Chinese business visitor at a meeting. [428] As of 5 February 2020 [update] , 493 deaths have been attributed to the virus since the first confirmed death on January 9, with 990 recoveries. [429] [423] The first death outside China was reported in the Philippines, in a 44-year-old Chinese male on February 1. [430] but another source reported:
"The first cases of COVID-19 outside of China were identified on January 13 in Thailand and on January 16 in Japan". [431]
There has been testing which have showed over 6000 confirmed cases in China, [432] some of whom are healthcare workers. [433] [434]
Confirmed cases have also been reported in Thailand , South Korea , Japan , Taiwan , Macau , Hong Kong , the United States ( Everett, Washington and Chicago ), [434] Singapore , [435] Vietnam , [436] France [437] and Nepal . [438]
The World Health Organization declared that this is a Public Health Emergency of International Concern since January 30, 2020.
Bloomberg News and other business publications have reported several plant closures , travel restrictions , and imposed quarantines as a result of this outbreak. [439]
As of February 10, 2020 there have been 40,235 confirmed cases reported of people infected by the virus in China. Also reported were 909 deaths, and 319 cases in 24 other countries, including one death, according to WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus . [440]
On November 14, 2020, there were 53,853,718 global COVID-19 cases and 1,311,524 deaths with cases in 217 countries and territories. [441]
The pandemic made it more difficult for millions of people all over the world to get enough food. People lost their jobs, so they did not have money to buy food. Farms were shut down, so there was less food made. Processing plants and food factories were shut down, so less food was made ready for people to eat. [497]
In April, Arif Husain of the United Nations' World Food Program said that 130 million more people could go hungry, in addition to the 135 million who were already hungry before the pandemic began. He said that poorer countries would be more affected than rich countries because the way they move raw food from farms to cities and other places where people live is less organized and relies more on human beings than on automatic systems . [497]
This hunger crisis is different from crises in other years because it happened to the whole world at the same time. That meant that people working in other countries could not help by sending money home. [497] [498]
All over the world, children who ate meals at school had less access to food when the schools were shut down. [497]
Scientists from the University of Michigan said the pandemic was making it harder for people to find food. In a study published in May, they said out of of seven Americans over age 50 said they had trouble getting enough food before the pandemic, and it got worse when senior centers that provided meals were closed. [499] Federal and state governments started programs to bring food to older people and children. There were also more food donation drives in towns. [498]
In the United States, nursing homes had some of the highest rates of infection and death,
40% of all COVID-19 deaths in the country. Nursing homes are group homes for old people who need medical care, for disabled people who need medical care, and for people recovering from severe sickness or injury, like stroke patients.

Turtle scientists in the United States and Thailand both reported more nests than usual on seashores in Florida and Phuket. They say it is because people are not coming to the beach or bringing their dogs to the beach and because there are fewer boats in the water nearby. Scientists also say they see more dugong and dolphins . [506] [507] [508] With fewer cars driving down roads, salamanders, frogs, and other amphibians were able to cross them for their spring migration. According to citizen scientists from Big Night Maine, a group that watches amphibians, four amphibians made it across the roads alive for every one amphibian killed by cars. Most years, it is only two to one. [509]
Not all ocean mammals did well. According to marine biologists in Florida, manatee deaths in April and May were 20% higher than in 2019. They say this was because many people decided to go boating because other things to do were closed. [510]

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARS-CoV-2
SARS coronavirus 2 ( SARS-CoV-2 ) is a positive-sense , single-stranded RNA coronavirus which causes the disease COVID-19 . [2] It used to be known as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by the World Health Organization (WHO). [3] [4]
The virus started the 2019–20 coronavirus outbreak . [5] [6] [7] The first suspected cases were reported to the WHO on December 31, 2019. [8] [9] Many early cases of this new coronavirus were linked to Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, a large seafood and animal market in Wuhan , China. The virus may have come from infected animals. It is not certain that this place was the source of the pandemic . [10]
The genetic material of this virus showed many similarities to SARS-CoV (79.5%) [11] and bat coronaviruses (96%). [11] This means the virus may have originally come from bats . [12] [13] [14] Scientists did more experiments that showed the virus probably went from bats to an intermediate host , meaning another animal in between bats and humans.  The viruses in that other animal changed over time until they could infect humans.  Scientists are close to sure that the original animal was a bat but not sure what the intermediate animal was. [15] Some scientists think it could have been a pangolin because there are coronaviruses that live in pangolins even though they are not exactly the same as SARS-CoV-2 or the ones in bats. [16] Pangolins are an endangered species and buying, selling or moving them from place to place is illegal in China and many other countries.  But their scales are an ingredient in many traditional Chinese medicines , so they are often sold on the black market . [17]
Although SARS-CoV-2 began in bats, scientists noticed that the bats do not get sick and die from it.  They think this is because the bats have very careful immune systems that fight the virus without causing inflammation .  Scientists are studying bats because of this. [18] [19]
Scientists are still looking at SARS-CoV-2 infection in animals, but only a variant strain has been confirmed to spread to minks which has become a huge problem worldwide. [20] It is also inducing fear in humans as there are cases being reported of transmission of COVID-19 from minks to humans. [21] Cats, dogs and other mammals are said to at relative risk but how they can get infected is still a mystery. [22]
In early February 2020, the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses' Coronavirus Study Group gave SARS-CoV-2 its official name, for sudden acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus number two. Before that, people called the virus "2019-nCoV," for "novel (new) coronavirus that appeared in 2019." The study group chose this name because the new virus was so similar to another virus that was already called SARS-CoV with no number. [23] [24]
First, the virus enters the cell with the help of the S protein or spike protein expressed on the surface of the virus beyond its envelope. [25] The spike protein attaches to the human cell receptor hACE2 or  human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 . ACE2 is found on the cells of the epithelial cell linings of the lungs, kidneys, and intestines. [26] After the attachment of the S- protein to the virus, the S protein splits into its two components- S1 head and S2 stalk . The S1 head is now able to bind to the TMPRSS2 receptor which is a serine protease enzyme containing a transmembrane domain. The interaction of TMPRSS2 and S1 trigger the cell membrane of the human cell to merge with that of the virus leading to viral genome entry into cells via endosomes. [27] [28] The viral genome in the endosomes which convert to lysosomes is then processed by cathepsin , which is then replicated in the human cells and released after viral packaging and maturation in the cells to infect others. In October 2020, scientists said they had seen SARS-CoV-2 use another receptor, Neuropilin-1 , to enter cells with the help of the furin cleavage site in its genome which was not found in any of its previous ancestors. [27] [29] [30]
SARS-CoV-2 can infect many kinds of cells, but it mostly infects cells in the respiratory system, such as the cells of the nose, pharynx and lungs.  Because it is in cells inside the nose, it can spread via aerosol or droplets when people breathe, talk, cough or sneeze. [30]
The expanding part of the lungs, pulmonary alveoli , have two main types of cells. One cell, type I , absorbs oxygen from the air, i.e. gas exchange . The other, type II , produces surfactants , that help keep the lungs fluid, clean, infection free, etc. COVID-19 finds a way into a surfactant producing type II cell, and smothers it by reproducing COVID-19 virus within it. Each type II cell which is killed by the virus causes an extreme reaction in the lungs. Fluids, pus, and dead cell material flood the lung, causing the coronavirus pulmonary disease. [31]
Scientists looked at the lungs from people who died of COVID-19. They compared them to lungs from people who died of influenza A and to lungs from people who died but not from any problem with their lungs.  They saw the cells that made up the skins of the blood vessels in the lungs were more badly damaged in the lungs from COVID-19 patients, and there was more blood clotting.  The most important difference the scientists saw was that the lungs had begun to grow new blood vessels . [32] [33]
In February 2020, the World Health Organization announced they had chosen a name for the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2: COVID-19. "Covi" for "coronavirus," "D" for "disease," and "19" for the year 2019.  They said they did not want the name to have any person, place, or animal in it, like "Wuhan," or “pangolin,” because then people might blame the disease on that place, person, or animal.  They also wanted the name to be easy to say out loud. [2]
According to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, COVID-19 makes people feel sick in different ways, but it usually affects the lungs.  People usually cough and have difficulty breathing.  They often also have a fever, chills, headache, pain in their muscles, or trouble tasting or smelling things. [34]
According to an April 2020 study by the American Gastroenterological Association, COVID-19 can make sick people vomit or have diarrhea but this is rare.  They said about 7.7% of COVID-19 patients threw up, about 7.8% had diarrhea and about 3.6% had pain in their stomachs. [35]
A study from the University of Arizona found that SARS-CoV-2 can prevent an infected person from feeling pain.  It does this by giving off vascular endothelial growth factor-A, which binds to the human body's neuropilin receptor .  This way, sick people do not feel pain, do not know they are sick, and spread the virus more than if they could feel pain. [36]
The SARS-CoV-2 virus looks like a round ball with spikes all around it. There are four parts to the virus: the spikes, a membrane, an envelope, and the virus' genetic material, or ribonucleic acid (RNA)  Each of these four parts is a different protein molecule. The spikes, membrane, and envelope are together called the viral envelope , or outer layer, of the virus. [37] [38]
SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-strand RNA virus, meaning that it uses ribonucleic acid (RNA) to hold the patterns to make the proteins it needs instead of using DNA the way humans and other multicellular living things do. [39]
In early 2020, some people began to think that the SARS-CoV-2 may have been made on purpose in a laboratory at the Wuhan Institute of Virology and released in Wuhan like a weapon.  When the leader of Iran , Ayatollah Khamenei , said that he did not want the United States to help his country against coronavirus, he named the idea that Americans had made the virus on purpose to harm Iranains as one of his reasons: "I do not know how real this accusation is but when it exists, who in their right mind would trust you to bring them medication?" said Khamenei. [40]
One survey by Pew Research showed 29% of Americans who answered thought SARS-CoV-2 could have been made in a lab on purpose and 23% thought it could have been made in a lab by accident. [41] A survey of people in the United Kingdom showed many of them thought COVID-19 was caused by 5G wireless networks. [42]
On March 17, 2020, scientists from Columbia University and other places published a paper in Nature Medicine showing that SARS-CoV-2 was almost surely not made by humans in a laboratory.  They did this by comparing the genomes of different viruses to each other. [16] The scientists saw that SARS-CoV-2 did not match any of the viral backbones that already exist for virologists to use. [43] The paper in Nature Medicine soon became one of the most cited scientific papers of all time. [16]
There are no fixed cures for the treatment of COVID-19,  but there are various drugs that have been approved for use such as Hydroxychloroquine and Remdesivir which are detailed below. Other antiviral drugs, interferon therapy and combination of anti-viral and interferons are also being experimented on to get the best possible outcome for patients. These treatments are used to reduce the symptoms and to keep the patients comfortable. [44] [45]
In April 2020, scientists from the University of Pittsburgh said they had made a vaccine, called PittCoVacc and tested it in mice. [46] [47]
Another team of scientists led by Dr. Josef Penninger of the University of British Columbia invented a medicine called  APN01 and tested it in engineered human tissue, meaning human cells put together in a lab to look and act like they were inside a body. The scientists learned that adding human soluble recombinant angiotensin  converting  enzyme 2 (ACE2) to these tissues infected with SARS-CoV-2 made it harder for the virus to reproduce. [48] [49]
In late April 2020, a team from Oxford University announced that they had developed a COVID-19 vaccine.  The United States National Institutes of health tested it in rhesus monkeys, and it worked.  The Oxford scientists said because they had already been working on a vaccine against a different coronavirus, they had a head start working on one for SARS-CoV-2.  The scientists said they would try to test their vaccine on 6000 people by the end of May 2020, and that their vaccine could be ready for people to use in September 2020. [50] [51]
In mid-May 2020, a company called Moderna said they tested their mRNA vaccine in forty-five people and eight of them produced antibodies [52] but they did not publish the specific data or publish an article in a scientific journal. [53] Anna Durbin of Johns Hopkins University said it was too soon to tell if people would keep the antibodies long enough for the vaccine to work. [54] The United States Food and Drug Administration gave Moderna permission to test the vaccine again in more people.  Moderna's chief medical officer said the vaccine could be ready in January 2021. [52]
Some people think hydroxychloroquine , a medicine given to people with malaria, lupus, and arthritis, could work against COVID-19 and some do not.  One study from China showed that COVID-19 patients who took hydroxychloroquine got better faster, but the study was not peer reviewed .  Other studies in France and China seemed to show hydroxychloroquine helped, but the studies did not include control groups, meaning the doctors did not compare patients who took hydroxychloroquine to patients who did not, so they could not be sure it was the hydroxychloroquine that was helping them or whether it was something else. [55] In March, the United States Food and Drug Administration gave doctors permission to give hydroxychloroquine to COVID-19 patients. [56]
United States President Donald Trump suggested the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine could help cure COVID-19, but Dr. Anthony Fauci , who is part of the White House 's official coronavirus team said no one could know if hydroxychloroquine worked against SARS-CoV-2.  In early April, the New York Times reported that President Trump has "a small personal financial interest" in Sanofi, one of the companies that makes hydroxychloroquine, meaning that if the company sold more hydroxychloroquine, he would have more wealth. [56]
In early April, Fauci said, "The data are really just at best suggestive. There have been cases that show there may be an effect and there are others to show there's no effect." [57] Dr. Megan L. Ranney of Brown University said that hydroxychloroquine can cause heart attacks and other problems.  Other doctors worry that if people take hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19, there will not be enough left for people with malaria, lupus, and arthritis.  Still, some hospitals have given hydroxychloroquine to COVID-19 patients who are very sick because the doctors think it is worth the risk. [55]
Scientists in France and China performed more studies on larger groups of patients taking hydroxychloroquine.  They watched patients who were taking the medicine and other treatment together and at patients who were only taking the other treatment.  Both studies showed that hydroxychloroquine did not help and did cause side effects.  Both studies were published in May 2020. [58]
Some scientists thought the drug remdesivir, which was invented as a medicine for Ebola , could work against SARS-CoV-2.  Remdesivir works against some viruses.  Remdesivir had already been tested in humans, so the doctors already knew it would not hurt the patients even if it did not make them better.  Because scientists already knew remdesivir was safe, they were able to start testing it in humans right away. [59] [60]
In one study, doctors gave a drug called remdesivir to 61 COVID-19 patients on a compassionate basis, meaning they gave them the drug because there was no other treatment available.  Scientists studied 53 of these patients and found that 68% of the patients got better, 13% died, and 25% had serious side effects.  But because the study had no control group, meaning these patients were not compared to other COVID-19 patients who were not taking remdesivir, and because only 53 people were in the experiment, scientists must run more studies before they can be sure remdesivir works. [59] [60]
The chairman and CEO of the company that makes remdesivir, David O'Day, said that remdesivir might work better in some patients than in others and asked scientists to perform many different kinds of studies. [59] [60]
In October 2020, the National Institutes of Health told the world the results of its tests: They studied 11,000 people and found that remdesivir did not help keep COVID-19 patients alive. [61]
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specialty_(medicine)
Medicine is a very complex field. In the past, a doctor could learn almost all that we knew about medicine. Now that is impossible. So after finishing medical school , young doctors choose what kind of doctor they wish to be. After school, they usually do more years of training to learn about the kind of medical specialty they want to do.
Some doctors try to learn some about all of the different subjects of medicine and how to treat all patients.  These doctors are called 'primary care' doctors or "primary care physicians" (PCPs). Sometimes they are also called 'generalists' or even 'general practitioners.' In the United States , these kind of doctors are sometimes called family practitioners or family medicine doctors. When a problem is strange or complex, they give it to a specialist.
There are other doctors who are also 'primary care' doctors. Pediatricians are primary care doctors, but only for children . Internists are primary care doctors for adults. Some gynecologists do primary care, but for women only.
Other doctors are called 'specialists'. This means they have learned more about certain types of medical care.  For example:
In the broadest meaning of 'medicine', there are many different specialties. However, within medical circles, there are two broad categories: "Medicine" and " Surgery ."
There are some medical specialties that do not fit into either of these categories, like radiology , pathology , and anesthesia .
In the U.S., all specialties must pass all three steps of the national medical board examinations.  Steps I and II happen during medical school.  Step III happens during intern year, where a person works as a student at a hospital .
After a person passes these exams, they then have to pass more exams that are specifically about their specialty.  These tests are both written and oral.
A doctor is board-certified in their specialty after:
There are only a few training spots per specialty each year, so some specialties can be very competitive . Some medical students do not get to train in the specialty they want. Other specialties do not have nearly enough doctors.  This can happen because not enough doctors apply for training spots; because more training spots are needed; or because many people fail out of their training program.
Surgical training requires at least five years of residency after medical school. Sub-specialties of surgery often require seven or more years. In addition, fellowships can last another one to three years. Because fellowships can be competitive, many trainees spend another two years on research .  Because of this, for some people, their surgical training will not finish until more than a decade after medical school.
Surgical training can be very difficult and can take a lot of time. An average surgical resident works 75 hours per week.
Some subspecialties of surgery, like neurosurgery , require even longer hours.  Residents training in these specialties often work 80 hours a week.  Officially, these specialties only allow their residents to work up to 88 hours per week.  However, many surgical programs still require residents to work more than 88 hours a week.
Attempts to limit the amount of hours that surgical residents work have been difficult, because:
Medical training, unlike surgical training, requires three years of residency training after medical school.  Doctors can then do a one- to two-year fellowship in their subspecialty. In general, medical residents work less hours than surgical residents.
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome_coronavirus_2
SARS coronavirus 2 ( SARS-CoV-2 ) is a positive-sense , single-stranded RNA coronavirus which causes the disease COVID-19 . [2] It used to be known as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by the World Health Organization (WHO). [3] [4]
The virus started the 2019–20 coronavirus outbreak . [5] [6] [7] The first suspected cases were reported to the WHO on December 31, 2019. [8] [9] Many early cases of this new coronavirus were linked to Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, a large seafood and animal market in Wuhan , China. The virus may have come from infected animals. It is not certain that this place was the source of the pandemic . [10]
The genetic material of this virus showed many similarities to SARS-CoV (79.5%) [11] and bat coronaviruses (96%). [11] This means the virus may have originally come from bats . [12] [13] [14] Scientists did more experiments that showed the virus probably went from bats to an intermediate host , meaning another animal in between bats and humans.  The viruses in that other animal changed over time until they could infect humans.  Scientists are close to sure that the original animal was a bat but not sure what the intermediate animal was. [15] Some scientists think it could have been a pangolin because there are coronaviruses that live in pangolins even though they are not exactly the same as SARS-CoV-2 or the ones in bats. [16] Pangolins are an endangered species and buying, selling or moving them from place to place is illegal in China and many other countries.  But their scales are an ingredient in many traditional Chinese medicines , so they are often sold on the black market . [17]
Although SARS-CoV-2 began in bats, scientists noticed that the bats do not get sick and die from it.  They think this is because the bats have very careful immune systems that fight the virus without causing inflammation .  Scientists are studying bats because of this. [18] [19]
Scientists are still looking at SARS-CoV-2 infection in animals, but only a variant strain has been confirmed to spread to minks which has become a huge problem worldwide. [20] It is also inducing fear in humans as there are cases being reported of transmission of COVID-19 from minks to humans. [21] Cats, dogs and other mammals are said to at relative risk but how they can get infected is still a mystery. [22]
In early February 2020, the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses' Coronavirus Study Group gave SARS-CoV-2 its official name, for sudden acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus number two. Before that, people called the virus "2019-nCoV," for "novel (new) coronavirus that appeared in 2019." The study group chose this name because the new virus was so similar to another virus that was already called SARS-CoV with no number. [23] [24]
First, the virus enters the cell with the help of the S protein or spike protein expressed on the surface of the virus beyond its envelope. [25] The spike protein attaches to the human cell receptor hACE2 or  human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 . ACE2 is found on the cells of the epithelial cell linings of the lungs, kidneys, and intestines. [26] After the attachment of the S- protein to the virus, the S protein splits into its two components- S1 head and S2 stalk . The S1 head is now able to bind to the TMPRSS2 receptor which is a serine protease enzyme containing a transmembrane domain. The interaction of TMPRSS2 and S1 trigger the cell membrane of the human cell to merge with that of the virus leading to viral genome entry into cells via endosomes. [27] [28] The viral genome in the endosomes which convert to lysosomes is then processed by cathepsin , which is then replicated in the human cells and released after viral packaging and maturation in the cells to infect others. In October 2020, scientists said they had seen SARS-CoV-2 use another receptor, Neuropilin-1 , to enter cells with the help of the furin cleavage site in its genome which was not found in any of its previous ancestors. [27] [29] [30]
SARS-CoV-2 can infect many kinds of cells, but it mostly infects cells in the respiratory system, such as the cells of the nose, pharynx and lungs.  Because it is in cells inside the nose, it can spread via aerosol or droplets when people breathe, talk, cough or sneeze. [30]
The expanding part of the lungs, pulmonary alveoli , have two main types of cells. One cell, type I , absorbs oxygen from the air, i.e. gas exchange . The other, type II , produces surfactants , that help keep the lungs fluid, clean, infection free, etc. COVID-19 finds a way into a surfactant producing type II cell, and smothers it by reproducing COVID-19 virus within it. Each type II cell which is killed by the virus causes an extreme reaction in the lungs. Fluids, pus, and dead cell material flood the lung, causing the coronavirus pulmonary disease. [31]
Scientists looked at the lungs from people who died of COVID-19. They compared them to lungs from people who died of influenza A and to lungs from people who died but not from any problem with their lungs.

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor
A risk factor in medicine is something that causes, or helps to cause, a medical condition. 
For example, smoking or breathing in somebody else's tobacco smoke (called second-hand smoke) is a risk factor for emphysema and lung cancer .
A trigger factor causes the symptoms of a medical condition to begin in a person who already has that medical condition. Example: Smoking or breathing in someone else's smoke can be a trigger factor for asthma. The person already had asthma but the smoke caused an asthma attack. [1]

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand_washing#Techniques
Hand washing is the process of cleaning hands with water and soap or other special liquids. It is done to take off dirt, germs , and poisons .  Germs and poisons cause diseases and other health problems.  Germs are bacteria , viruses , or fungi .  Some diseases are not stopped by antibiotic drugs. Hand washing prevents lots of new diseases. Not washing hands before cooking or touching food is risky .
Always wash hands:
Use soap and warm (running, if available) water. Wet hands and add soap. Rub wet hands strongly with soap outside running water more than 10 seconds. Rub all parts of the hands again and again. Clean all dirt under fingernails. Then rub hands under running water again and again to take off all soap. Dry hands using a clean cloth or paper. Use moisturizing lotion so hands do not dry if the hands are being washed many times every day.
For a medical worker, doctor, or nurse, not washing hands before touching every new person is dangerous. Use more than enough soap and water and rub each part of the hands again and again. Rub between each finger. Use a brush and clean under fingernails. Use more water to take off the soap and dry hands paper towel.
To scrub the hands for a surgery , water that can  be turned on and off without touching with the hands is needed, a cleaning liquid named "chlorhexidine" or "iodine wash", sterile cloth for drying the hands after washing, a sterile brush for hard washing and another sterile instrument for cleaning under the fingernails. Take off all watches, rings, and other jewels from the hands before washing. Wash the hands  and arms to the elbows again and again. Be strong and serious about the washing.  Use running water again and again to take off all soap. Keep hands up so water does not go from arms to hands. Dry the hands with the sterile cloth and put on surgical shirt or dress. Sterile means nothing on it that could cause a disease.

An asymptomatic carrier ( healthy carrier or just carrier ) is a person or other animal which has become infected with a pathogen , but who shows no signs or symptoms . Although unaffected by the pathogen themselves, carriers can transmit it to others. [1]
Mary Mallon , known as "Typhoid Mary", was an asymptomatic carrier of Salmonella enterica , the causative agent of typhoid fever . [2] She worked as a cook for several families in New York City at the beginning of the twentieth century and she also cooked for the soldiers. Several cases of typhoid fever in members of those families were traced to her by the Health Department. It appeared that she "carried" the infectious agent without becoming sick. At the time, there was no way of eradicating the disease.
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_disease
Infection is the invasion of an organism's body tissues by disease -causing agents. The disease is caused by the invading agents multiplying. As they multiply, they produce toxins and damage host tissues . [1] [2] Infectious disease , also known as 'transmissible disease' or 'communicable disease', is illness resulting from an infection.
Some infections are caused by different infectious agents at different times. For example, some diarrhea is caused by bacteria. Some is caused by viruses.
This is a very short list. There are many more diseases from infection and other causes: common diseases .
Some diseases can be passed from one person to another easily. Other infectious diseases are harder to get. If a person kisses or touches another person who is infected with the flu, a cold, measles , or a sore throat, he or she may get their disease. They may also give the person their disease if they cough on them. Other medical conditions such as AIDS, herpes , and hepatitis B, are only passed by closer contact. Having sex with an infected person, blood transfusions, or touching their blood or urine can sometimes pass on these conditions or diseases.
People can stop disease by:
Bacteria are usually treated with antibiotic medicines like Tetracycline and Penicillin. Viruses will not be killed by antibiotics. They must be treated with special medicines called antivirals. Medicines to treat HIV/AIDS like zidovudine are antivirals. Antifungals like miconazole and fluconazole treat infections from fungus. Anti-parasitic medicines like Praziquantel and mebendazole.
Some infectious diseases have no treatments that work well. For example, there is no medicine that works well to cure West Nile Virus and Rabies. So it is important to avoid getting these diseases. Some infectious disease goes away on its own. These mild diseases do not need to be treated. For example, colds are caused by viruses and they do not need medicines.
Some diseases can be prevented by immunizations . Immunizations try to make a person have an immune reaction to an infectious agent. This is usually done before the person gets the disease. Examples of diseases prevented by immunizations are: polio , tetanus , and pertussis . In some cases, if all of the disease can be removed from society, we can get rid of the disease completely. An example of this is smallpox . This virus used to kill people, cause blindness, and bad scars. Now there has not been a person who had smallpox in over thirty years.
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome_coronavirus_2
SARS coronavirus 2 ( SARS-CoV-2 ) is a positive-sense , single-stranded RNA coronavirus which causes the disease COVID-19 . [2] It used to be known as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by the World Health Organization (WHO). [3] [4]
The virus started the 2019–20 coronavirus outbreak . [5] [6] [7] The first suspected cases were reported to the WHO on December 31, 2019. [8] [9] Many early cases of this new coronavirus were linked to Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, a large seafood and animal market in Wuhan , China. The virus may have come from infected animals. It is not certain that this place was the source of the pandemic . [10]
The genetic material of this virus showed many similarities to SARS-CoV (79.5%) [11] and bat coronaviruses (96%). [11] This means the virus may have originally come from bats . [12] [13] [14] Scientists did more experiments that showed the virus probably went from bats to an intermediate host , meaning another animal in between bats and humans.  The viruses in that other animal changed over time until they could infect humans.  Scientists are close to sure that the original animal was a bat but not sure what the intermediate animal was. [15] Some scientists think it could have been a pangolin because there are coronaviruses that live in pangolins even though they are not exactly the same as SARS-CoV-2 or the ones in bats. [16] Pangolins are an endangered species and buying, selling or moving them from place to place is illegal in China and many other countries.  But their scales are an ingredient in many traditional Chinese medicines , so they are often sold on the black market . [17]
Although SARS-CoV-2 began in bats, scientists noticed that the bats do not get sick and die from it.  They think this is because the bats have very careful immune systems that fight the virus without causing inflammation .  Scientists are studying bats because of this. [18] [19]
Scientists are still looking at SARS-CoV-2 infection in animals, but only a variant strain has been confirmed to spread to minks which has become a huge problem worldwide. [20] It is also inducing fear in humans as there are cases being reported of transmission of COVID-19 from minks to humans. [21] Cats, dogs and other mammals are said to at relative risk but how they can get infected is still a mystery. [22]
In early February 2020, the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses' Coronavirus Study Group gave SARS-CoV-2 its official name, for sudden acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus number two. Before that, people called the virus "2019-nCoV," for "novel (new) coronavirus that appeared in 2019." The study group chose this name because the new virus was so similar to another virus that was already called SARS-CoV with no number. [23] [24]
First, the virus enters the cell with the help of the S protein or spike protein expressed on the surface of the virus beyond its envelope. [25] The spike protein attaches to the human cell receptor hACE2 or  human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 . ACE2 is found on the cells of the epithelial cell linings of the lungs, kidneys, and intestines. [26] After the attachment of the S- protein to the virus, the S protein splits into its two components- S1 head and S2 stalk . The S1 head is now able to bind to the TMPRSS2 receptor which is a serine protease enzyme containing a transmembrane domain. The interaction of TMPRSS2 and S1 trigger the cell membrane of the human cell to merge with that of the virus leading to viral genome entry into cells via endosomes. [27] [28] The viral genome in the endosomes which convert to lysosomes is then processed by cathepsin , which is then replicated in the human cells and released after viral packaging and maturation in the cells to infect others. In October 2020, scientists said they had seen SARS-CoV-2 use another receptor, Neuropilin-1 , to enter cells with the help of the furin cleavage site in its genome which was not found in any of its previous ancestors. [27] [29] [30]
SARS-CoV-2 can infect many kinds of cells, but it mostly infects cells in the respiratory system, such as the cells of the nose, pharynx and lungs.  Because it is in cells inside the nose, it can spread via aerosol or droplets when people breathe, talk, cough or sneeze. [30]
The expanding part of the lungs, pulmonary alveoli , have two main types of cells. One cell, type I , absorbs oxygen from the air, i.e. gas exchange . The other, type II , produces surfactants , that help keep the lungs fluid, clean, infection free, etc. COVID-19 finds a way into a surfactant producing type II cell, and smothers it by reproducing COVID-19 virus within it. Each type II cell which is killed by the virus causes an extreme reaction in the lungs. Fluids, pus, and dead cell material flood the lung, causing the coronavirus pulmonary disease. [31]
Scientists looked at the lungs from people who died of COVID-19. They compared them to lungs from people who died of influenza A and to lungs from people who died but not from any problem with their lungs.  They saw the cells that made up the skins of the blood vessels in the lungs were more badly damaged in the lungs from COVID-19 patients, and there was more blood clotting.  The most important difference the scientists saw was that the lungs had begun to grow new blood vessels . [32] [33]
In February 2020, the World Health Organization announced they had chosen a name for the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2: COVID-19. "Covi" for "coronavirus," "D" for "disease," and "19" for the year 2019.  They said they did not want the name to have any person, place, or animal in it, like "Wuhan," or “pangolin,” because then people might blame the disease on that place, person, or animal.  They also wanted the name to be easy to say out loud. [2]
According to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, COVID-19 makes people feel sick in different ways, but it usually affects the lungs.  People usually cough and have difficulty breathing.  They often also have a fever, chills, headache, pain in their muscles, or trouble tasting or smelling things. [34]
According to an April 2020 study by the American Gastroenterological Association, COVID-19 can make sick people vomit or have diarrhea but this is rare.  They said about 7.7% of COVID-19 patients threw up, about 7.8% had diarrhea and about 3.6% had pain in their stomachs. [35]
A study from the University of Arizona found that SARS-CoV-2 can prevent an infected person from feeling pain.  It does this by giving off vascular endothelial growth factor-A, which binds to the human body's neuropilin receptor .  This way, sick people do not feel pain, do not know they are sick, and spread the virus more than if they could feel pain. [36]
The SARS-CoV-2 virus looks like a round ball with spikes all around it. There are four parts to the virus: the spikes, a membrane, an envelope, and the virus' genetic material, or ribonucleic acid (RNA)  Each of these four parts is a different protein molecule. The spikes, membrane, and envelope are together called the viral envelope , or outer layer, of the virus. [37] [38]
SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-strand RNA virus, meaning that it uses ribonucleic acid (RNA) to hold the patterns to make the proteins it needs instead of using DNA the way humans and other multicellular living things do. [39]
In early 2020, some people began to think that the SARS-CoV-2 may have been made on purpose in a laboratory at the Wuhan Institute of Virology and released in Wuhan like a weapon.  When the leader of Iran , Ayatollah Khamenei , said that he did not want the United States to help his country against coronavirus, he named the idea that Americans had made the virus on purpose to harm Iranains as one of his reasons: "I do not know how real this accusation is but when it exists, who in their right mind would trust you to bring them medication?" said Khamenei. [40]
One survey by Pew Research showed 29% of Americans who answered thought SARS-CoV-2 could have been made in a lab on purpose and 23% thought it could have been made in a lab by accident. [41] A survey of people in the United Kingdom showed many of them thought COVID-19 was caused by 5G wireless networks. [42]
On March 17, 2020, scientists from Columbia University and other places published a paper in Nature Medicine showing that SARS-CoV-2 was almost surely not made by humans in a laboratory.  They did this by comparing the genomes of different viruses to each other. [16] The scientists saw that SARS-CoV-2 did not match any of the viral backbones that already exist for virologists to use. [43] The paper in Nature Medicine soon became one of the most cited scientific papers of all time. [16]
There are no fixed cures for the treatment of COVID-19,  but there are various drugs that have been approved for use such as Hydroxychloroquine and Remdesivir which are detailed below. Other antiviral drugs, interferon therapy and combination of anti-viral and interferons are also being experimented on to get the best possible outcome for patients. These treatments are used to reduce the symptoms and to keep the patients comfortable. [44] [45]
In April 2020, scientists from the University of Pittsburgh said they had made a vaccine, called PittCoVacc and tested it in mice. [46] [47]
Another team of scientists led by Dr. Josef Penninger of the University of British Columbia invented a medicine called  APN01 and tested it in engineered human tissue, meaning human cells put together in a lab to look and act like they were inside a body. The scientists learned that adding human soluble recombinant angiotensin  converting  enzyme 2 (ACE2) to these tissues infected with SARS-CoV-2 made it harder for the virus to reproduce. [48] [49]
In late April 2020, a team from Oxford University announced that they had developed a COVID-19 vaccine.  The United States National Institutes of health tested it in rhesus monkeys, and it worked.  The Oxford scientists said because they had already been working on a vaccine against a different coronavirus, they had a head start working on one for SARS-CoV-2.  The scientists said they would try to test their vaccine on 6000 people by the end of May 2020, and that their vaccine could be ready for people to use in September 2020. [50] [51]
In mid-May 2020, a company called Moderna said they tested their mRNA vaccine in forty-five people and eight of them produced antibodies [52] but they did not publish the specific data or publish an article in a scientific journal. [53] Anna Durbin of Johns Hopkins University said it was too soon to tell if people would keep the antibodies long enough for the vaccine to work. [54] The United States Food and Drug Administration gave Moderna permission to test the vaccine again in more people.  Moderna's chief medical officer said the vaccine could be ready in January 2021. [52]
Some people think hydroxychloroquine , a medicine given to people with malaria, lupus, and arthritis, could work against COVID-19 and some do not.  One study from China showed that COVID-19 patients who took hydroxychloroquine got better faster, but the study was not peer reviewed .  Other studies in France and China seemed to show hydroxychloroquine helped, but the studies did not include control groups, meaning the doctors did not compare patients who took hydroxychloroquine to patients who did not, so they could not be sure it was the hydroxychloroquine that was helping them or whether it was something else. [55] In March, the United States Food and Drug Administration gave doctors permission to give hydroxychloroquine to COVID-19 patients. [56]
United States President Donald Trump suggested the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine could help cure COVID-19, but Dr. Anthony Fauci , who is part of the White House 's official coronavirus team said no one could know if hydroxychloroquine worked against SARS-CoV-2.  In early April, the New York Times reported that President Trump has "a small personal financial interest" in Sanofi, one of the companies that makes hydroxychloroquine, meaning that if the company sold more hydroxychloroquine, he would have more wealth. [56]
In early April, Fauci said, "The data are really just at best suggestive. There have been cases that show there may be an effect and there are others to show there's no effect." [57] Dr. Megan L. Ranney of Brown University said that hydroxychloroquine can cause heart attacks and other problems.  Other doctors worry that if people take hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19, there will not be enough left for people with malaria, lupus, and arthritis.  Still, some hospitals have given hydroxychloroquine to COVID-19 patients who are very sick because the doctors think it is worth the risk. [55]
Scientists in France and China performed more studies on larger groups of patients taking hydroxychloroquine.  They watched patients who were taking the medicine and other treatment together and at patients who were only taking the other treatment.  Both studies showed that hydroxychloroquine did not help and did cause side effects.  Both studies were published in May 2020. [58]
Some scientists thought the drug remdesivir, which was invented as a medicine for Ebola , could work against SARS-CoV-2.  Remdesivir works against some viruses.  Remdesivir had already been tested in humans, so the doctors already knew it would not hurt the patients even if it did not make them better.  Because scientists already knew remdesivir was safe, they were able to start testing it in humans right away. [59] [60]
In one study, doctors gave a drug called remdesivir to 61 COVID-19 patients on a compassionate basis, meaning they gave them the drug because there was no other treatment available.  Scientists studied 53 of these patients and found that 68% of the patients got better, 13% died, and 25% had serious side effects.  But because the study had no control group, meaning these patients were not compared to other COVID-19 patients who were not taking remdesivir, and because only 53 people were in the experiment, scientists must run more studies before they can be sure remdesivir works. [59] [60]
The chairman and CEO of the company that makes remdesivir, David O'Day, said that remdesivir might work better in some patients than in others and asked scientists to perform many different kinds of studies. [59] [60]
In October 2020, the National Institutes of Health told the world the results of its tests: They studied 11,000 people and found that remdesivir did not help keep COVID-19 patients alive. [61]
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome
Severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) [1] was an atypical pneumonia . [2] It started in November 2002 in Guangdong Province , in the city of Foshan, of the People's Republic of China . The disease was caused by the SARS coronavirus (SARS CoV), a new coronavirus . It was also a part-time STD , it can be spread through both sexual and casual contact.
SARS is a zoonosis : it is a disease which comes from animals: it came from  Asian palm civets to cave-dwelling horseshoe bats . Exactly how the virus got to humans is not known.
SARS was first reported in Asia in February 2003. Over the next few months, the illness spread to more than 24 countries in Asia, North America , South America , and Europe before the SARS global outbreak of 2003 was contained. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), a total of 8098 people worldwide became sick with SARS during the 2003 outbreak; 774 of these died.
After the Chinese government suppressed news of the SARS outbreak, the disease spread rapidly, reaching Hong Kong and Vietnam in late February 2003, and then to other countries via international travellers. The last case in this outbreak occurred in June 2003. There were a total of 8437 known cases of the disease, with 813 deaths (a mortality rate of 9.636%).
In May 2005 the disease itself was declared 'eradicated' by the WHO and it became the second disease in mankind to receive this label (the other was smallpox ). The New York Times reported that "not a single case of severe acute respiratory syndrome has been reported this year or in late 2004. It is the first winter without a case since the initial outbreak in late 2002. Also, the epidemic strain of SARS that caused at least 813 deaths worldwide by June of 2003 has not been seen outside a laboratory since then." [3]
In late 2019, a new strian of SARS emerged in Wuhan, China and turn out to be a global pandemic in the year 2020 .
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic , also called the coronavirus pandemic , is a current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). [1] [6] [b] The outbreak started in Wuhan , Hubei , China, in December 2019. The World Health Organization (WHO) called it a pandemic on 11 March 2020. [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses gave the virus its name. As of February 19, 2021, more than 110 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in more than 188 countries and territories. More than two million people have died of COVID-19, [12] and more than 85 million people have defeated, or recovered from the disease. [12] [13] [14]
The virus usually moves from one person to another with small drops made when coughing [15] [16] or sneezing . [17] It mostly spreads when people are close to each other, which is why social distancing is encouraged. Coronavirus can also spread when people touch a surface with the virus, and then they touch their face. [16] [17] Common symptoms include fever , cough, and trouble breathing. [18] The illness can worsen with pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome . [19] As of January 2021, a number of vaccines for COVID-19 have been developed, but only a few have been approved as safe for use. The first vaccine to be approved was created by Pfizer and BioNTech , [20] followed by the Oxford / AstraZeneca [21] vaccine. Vaccine distribution has begun in many countries in Europe, North America, South America and Asia. [22] The United Kingdom was the first western country to administer a COVID-19 vaccine. [23] No antiviral medicine for COVID-19 is available. [24] Doctors usually give patients supportive therapy instead. [25] People can avoid spreading the virus by regularly washing their hands, covering their mouth when coughing, maintaining distance from other people , staying away from crowds, wearing medical or cloth face coverings, and being alone for people who think they are infected, also known as quarantining . [24]
The outbreak might be from a coronavirus that usually lives in bats . This infected another animal, possibly a pangolin . It then changed inside that other animal until it could infect humans. [26] It originated at a wet market Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market and is linked to China’s wild animal meat trade. Live foxes , crocodiles , wolf pups, giant salamanders , snakes , rats , peacocks , porcupines , koalas and game meats were on the menu at the market. [27] A 55-year-old person from Hubei province was the first human to contract the virus on November 17, 2019. [28] A 61-year-old man who was a regular customer at the market was the first person to die from the virus on January 11, 2020. [29] The exact origin of the virus is still unknown since the market in Wuhan sold a variety of live wild animals in cages. Chinese tourists have spread the virus by traveling to other countries and made it a worldwide pandemic. [30]
Racism and xenophobia against Chinese people and Asians increased during the pandemic.
In November 2020, two companies, Pfizer and Moderna , said they had finished making COVID-19 vaccines . Both are over 90% effective. Two mRNA vaccines, one by Pfizer and one by Moderna, have been tested. Both were over 90% effective. [31] Countries began planning to give the vaccine to many people. [32] [33] [34]
The United States had the most deaths from the virus. More than 600,000 Americans died from the virus. [35] California had the most COVID-19 cases in the country. [36] Los Angeles was the most infected city.
Epidemiology is the study of how diseases affect the health and illness of groups of people.
On 31 December 2019, Chinese health authorities reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) a cluster of viral pneumonia cases of unknown cause in Wuhan , [37] [38] and an investigation was launched in early January 2020. [39]
On 9 June 2020, a Harvard University study suggested that COVID-19 may have been spreading in China as early as August 2019, based on hospital car park usage and web search trends. [40]
Cases means the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and have tested positive. [41] These cases are according to Johns Hopkins University .
Most people who contract COVID-19 recover. For those who do not, the time between the start of symptoms and death usually ranges from 6 to 41 days, but most of the time about 14 days. [42] This data are recorded by the WHO .
On 11 March 2020, the WHO said that the pandemic could be controlled. [7]
According to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, COVID-19 makes people feel sick in different ways, but it usually affects the lungs. People usually cough and have difficulty breathing. They often also have a fever , chills, headache , pain in their muscles, or trouble tasting or smelling things, [44] which can often be confused with the flu virus. [45]
According to an April 2020 study by the American Gastroenterological Association, COVID-19 can make sick people vomit or have diarrhea , but this is rare. They said about 7.7% of COVID-19 patients vomited , about 7.8% had diarrhea and about 3.6% had pain in their stomachs. [46]

In February 2020, the WHO announced a name for the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2: COVID-19. It replaced the name "2019-nCoV." [393] "Covi" is for "coronavirus," "D" for "disease," and "19" for the year 2019-- the year it was first detected. They said they did not want the name to have any person, place, or animal in it because people might blame the disease on that place, person, or animal. For example, it did not use the word "Wuhan." They also wanted the name to be easy to say out loud. [394]
According to an article in Market Watch dated on February 27, 2020, the overall case mortality rate in China was 2.3%. However, these results might be severely different between different age groups and between men and women. People over the age of 70 experienced a rate of mortality 4-5 times that of the average. Men were more likely to die than women (2.8% versus 1.7% for women) possibly due to lifestyle, such as it being more possible in men to drink and smoke, making the risk of having a respiratory illness more possible, and thus more vulnerable. [395] These numbers were the conclusion of a study by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention using 72,314 COVID-19 cases in mainland China as of Feb. 11. At that point this was the largest sample of cases for such a study. [396]
On March 5, 2020, the WHO released the case fatality rate. [397]
COVID-19 did not affect everyone in each country the same way. [398] As of May 2020, APM Research Lab said the death rate among black Americans was 2.4 times as high as for white Americans and 2.2 times as high as for Latino and Asian Americans. [399] In July 2020, The New York Times printed data from the Centers for Disease Control showing that black and Latino Americans were three times as likely to become sick and twice as likely to die as white Americans. This was not only in large cities but also in rural areas. This was not only for old people but for people in all age groups. Native Americans were also more likely than whites to become sick and die. Asian Americans were 1.3 times as likely as whites to become sick. [400]
Camara Jones, an epidemiologist who once worked for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said this was socioeconomic and not because of any natural difference in black and white people's bodies. [401] In the United States, black citizens are more likely to work jobs where they serve the public directly and to ride on public transport rather than take their own cars to work.  This makes them more likely to be infected than people who work in private offices or from home. Sharrelle Barber, an epidemiologist and biostatistician from Drexel University , also said black Americans can live in crowded neighborhoods where social distancing is harder to do and healthy food harder to find. [402] Both Barber and Jones blamed the long history of racism in the United States for these things. Three senators, Kamala Harris , Cory Booker and Elizabeth Warren said the federal government should start recording the race of COVID-19 patients so scientists could study this problem. [402]
In June, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) told the public that people using the United States' government's Medicare health program had different results depending on race. Four times as many black Medicare patients went to hospitals for COVID-19 than white Medicare patients. There were twice as many hospitalized Hispanic patients than white patients. There were three hospitalized Asian patients for every two hospitalized white patients. The head of CMS, Seema Verma, said this was mostly because of socioeconomic status. [403]
In the United Kingdom, twice as many black COVID-19 patients died as white COVID-19 patients. Other non-white people, like people from India and Bangladesh, were also more likely to die of COVID-19 than whites. Britain's Office of National Statistics said that the differences in money and education explained some of this difference but not all of it. They also said they did not know whether non-white patients caught COVID-19 more often or whether they caught more severe cases. Only female Chinese Britons were less likely to die of COVID-19 than white Britons. [404]
Native Americans in the United States have shown more deaths from COVID-19 than the rest of the U.S. [405] As of May, the Navajo Nation had 88 deaths and 2,757 cases, and the money they had been promised by the government arrived several weeks late. Only 30% of the people in the Navajo Nation have pipes with running water, which made it difficult for people to wash their hands. [406]
Scientists from Chapman University made a plan to protect the Tsimane people in Bolivia from COVID-19 and said this plan would also work for other indigenous peoples living on their own land. The scientists said that many indigenous peoples have problems that make COVID-19 more dangerous for them, like poverty, less clean water, and other lung diseases. Hospitals may be a long distance away, and racism can affect the way doctors and nurses react. But they also sometimes have things that help, like traditions of making decisions together and the ability to grow food nearby. [405] The scientists found people who spoke the Tsimane language as a first language and made teams to go to Tsimane towns to warn them about COVID-19. They also used radio stations. They said the best plan was for whole communities to decide to isolate. They found this worked well because the Tsimane already usually made their big decisions together as a community in special meetings and already had a tradition of quarantining new mothers. The Chapman scientists said their plan would also work for other indigenous peoples who also make decisions together, like the Tsimane. [407] [405] The Waswanipi Cree in Canada, the Mapoon people in Australia, and many groups in South America already tried plans like these on their own. [405] [408]
In May 2020, police officers in Minneapolis, Minnesota killed an unarmed black man called George Floyd while they were arresting him. There were weeks of protests all over the world against police brutality and racism. Experts said they were worried protesters and police could spread SARS-CoV-2 to each other. Other experts said some of the reasons that the protests were so big was because non-white people were being killed by COVID-19 more than white people were, because poor leadership in the COVID-19 crisis reminded them of poor leadership about racism, and because the lockdowns shut down workplaces and other things. This meant people had more time to protest. [408] [409] [410] [411]
African Americans are more likely to die from the virus compared to other people in the United States . [412]
Romani people (Gypsies) in Europe were hard-hit by COVID-19. [413]
In early 2020, some people began to think that the SARS-CoV-2 may have been made on purpose in a laboratory and either released by accident or on purpose like a weapon. Some Iranians thought the Americans might have made it. [414] Chinese state media said COVID-19 came from the United States to China and not the other way around. [415] Some Americans thought the Chinese might have made it. [416] Some Britons thought it might have been created by accident by 5G cell phone networks. [417]
On March 17, 2020, scientists from Columbia University and other places published a paper in Nature Medicine showing that SARS-CoV-2 was almost surely not made by humans in a laboratory. They did this by comparing the genomes of different viruses to each other. [26] The scientists saw that SARS-CoV-2 did not match any of the viral backbones that already exist for virologists to use. [418] Within a few weeks, it became one of the most cited scientific papers in history, meaning that other scientists were reading and using it.

On December 31, 2019, China alerted WHO to several cases of unusual pneumonia in Wuhan , Hubei province. [421]
On January 20, 2020, Chinese premier Li Keqiang called for efforts to stop and control the pneumonia epidemic caused by a novel coronavirus. [422] As of February 5, 2020, 24,588 cases have been confirmed, [423] [424] including in every province-level division of China . [423] A larger number of people may have been infected, but not detected (especially mild cases). [425] [426] The first local transmission of the virus outside China occurred in Vietnam between family members, [427] while the first local transmission not involving family occurred in Germany, on January 22, when a German man contracted the disease from a Chinese business visitor at a meeting. [428] As of 5 February 2020 [update] , 493 deaths have been attributed to the virus since the first confirmed death on January 9, with 990 recoveries. [429] [423] The first death outside China was reported in the Philippines, in a 44-year-old Chinese male on February 1. [430] but another source reported:
"The first cases of COVID-19 outside of China were identified on January 13 in Thailand and on January 16 in Japan". [431]
There has been testing which have showed over 6000 confirmed cases in China, [432] some of whom are healthcare workers. [433] [434]
Confirmed cases have also been reported in Thailand , South Korea , Japan , Taiwan , Macau , Hong Kong , the United States ( Everett, Washington and Chicago ), [434] Singapore , [435] Vietnam , [436] France [437] and Nepal . [438]
The World Health Organization declared that this is a Public Health Emergency of International Concern since January 30, 2020.
Bloomberg News and other business publications have reported several plant closures , travel restrictions , and imposed quarantines as a result of this outbreak. [439]
As of February 10, 2020 there have been 40,235 confirmed cases reported of people infected by the virus in China. Also reported were 909 deaths, and 319 cases in 24 other countries, including one death, according to WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus . [440]
On November 14, 2020, there were 53,853,718 global COVID-19 cases and 1,311,524 deaths with cases in 217 countries and territories. [441]
The pandemic made it more difficult for millions of people all over the world to get enough food. People lost their jobs, so they did not have money to buy food. Farms were shut down, so there was less food made. Processing plants and food factories were shut down, so less food was made ready for people to eat. [497]
In April, Arif Husain of the United Nations' World Food Program said that 130 million more people could go hungry, in addition to the 135 million who were already hungry before the pandemic began. He said that poorer countries would be more affected than rich countries because the way they move raw food from farms to cities and other places where people live is less organized and relies more on human beings than on automatic systems . [497]
This hunger crisis is different from crises in other years because it happened to the whole world at the same time. That meant that people working in other countries could not help by sending money home. [497] [498]
All over the world, children who ate meals at school had less access to food when the schools were shut down. [497]
Scientists from the University of Michigan said the pandemic was making it harder for people to find food. In a study published in May, they said out of of seven Americans over age 50 said they had trouble getting enough food before the pandemic, and it got worse when senior centers that provided meals were closed. [499] Federal and state governments started programs to bring food to older people and children. There were also more food donation drives in towns. [498]
In the United States, nursing homes had some of the highest rates of infection and death,
40% of all COVID-19 deaths in the country. Nursing homes are group homes for old people who need medical care, for disabled people who need medical care, and for people recovering from severe sickness or injury, like stroke patients.
Many people who live in nursing homes pay through the government program Medicaid, which pays less than Medicare or regular insurance companies. In June, many American nursing homes were caught throwing their regular patients out so they could make room for COVID-19 patients who could pay them more. Because nursing homes had stopped allowing visitors, it took longer for them to get caught. United States law requires nursing homes to warn patients 30 days before kicking them out, but the nursing homes did not do this.
Some of the nursing homes took the COVID-19 patients because state governments asked them to and they say they sent their elderly residents away because they were worried they would catch COVID-19 from the sick patients. [500]
Because so many governments told people to stay at home, there was less air pollution than usual for that time of year. Pollution in New York fell by 50% and the use of coal in China fell by 40%. [501] The European Space Agency showed pictures taken from a satellite of China's pollution disappearing during quarantine and coming back when everyone went back to work. [502]
The pandemic and shutdowns made people use less electricity. In the United States, people got less of their electricity from coal power but kept using gas and renewable power like wind and solar power. This was because coal plants are more expensive to run, so power companies used them less. [503]
Pollution from before the pandemic also affected what happened after people became sick. Scientists saw that more people died from COVID-19 in places with large amounts of air pollution. One team of scientists from Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg looked at air pollution information from satellites and statistics on COVID-19 deaths in Italy, France, Germany and Spain and saw that places with large amounts of nitrogen dioxide pollution had more people die from COVID-19. Nitrogen dioxide can damage the lungs. [504] [505]
The shutdowns and social distancing also affected animals. Human beings started staying at home about the same time in the spring when sea turtles like to come on land to lay their eggs. Turtle scientists in the United States and Thailand both reported more nests than usual on seashores in Florida and Phuket. They say it is because people are not coming to the beach or bringing their dogs to the beach and because there are fewer boats in the water nearby. Scientists also say they see more dugong and dolphins . [506] [507] [508] With fewer cars driving down roads, salamanders, frogs, and other amphibians were able to cross them for their spring migration. According to citizen scientists from Big Night Maine, a group that watches amphibians, four amphibians made it across the roads alive for every one amphibian killed by cars. Most years, it is only two to one. [509]
Not all ocean mammals did well. According to marine biologists in Florida, manatee deaths in April and May were 20% higher than in 2019. They say this was because many people decided to go boating because other things to do were closed. [510]
Researchers from the San Diego Zoo Global had the idea for a system that people could use to find dangerous germs before they become pandemics or even before they jump from other animals to humans. They said it was important to watch the wildlife trade, like in the Wuhan wet market. The scientists said that over the past eleven years it has gotten easier and easier to sequence viral genomes, and it does not have to be done by a large lab or by a government any more. The scientists said it would be better to spread the work out among more people. [511] [512]
Avoiding traveling and staying home will greatly reduce your risk from catching COVID-19. Staying home doesn't apply if one is sick and needs medical care. Get enough rest and stay hydrated. [513] Wearing a mask and washing your hands can prevent the virus from spreading. [514] Masks should not be placed on children under 2 years of age, people who have trouble breathing, have a respiratory or other medical condition which renders one unable to wear a mask safely, or anyone who is unable to remove the mask without help. Covering coughs and sneezes also reduce the risk of spreading the virus, but one can infect someone else by touching things with coughed/sneezed-in hands. Making sure not to share drinking glasses, cups and particularly other objects which people will drink or eat out of is important if one assumes they are infected or tested positive in the past. Washing eating utensils and other oral eating objects is preferable and cleaning surfaces or possessions which have been repeatedly touched is also important. These include, according to the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention, phones, remote controls, counters, tabletops, doorknobs, bathroom fixtures, toilets, keyboards, tablets, and bedside tables. Avoiding touching your face, nose, or mouth with your hands. Avoiding public transportation, taxis or taking rides with others can stop one's exposure to the virus. [513] Rumors spread about high doses of Vitamin C preventing COVID-19, but these as of October 14, 2020, there has been no conclusive evidence to support this idea. [515] However, there has been evidence pointing to the fact that dosing patients with Vitamin C, either through mouth or IV can reduce time on mechanical ventilators for seriously ill patients by 14%. [516] Drinking tea such as black tea and green tea can inhibit the virus. [517] Staying home for the holidays , having a small gathering of close friends and family members who are consistently taking measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and celebrating virtually through social media can prevent being infected by the virus. Airports, bus stations, train stations, public transport, gas stations, and rest stops are all places travelers can be exposed to catching the virus. [518] Eating a healthy diet that is high in fruits and vegetables, getting rest and sleep, exercising, consuming raw honey, probiotics, garlic, mushrooms and elderberry can boost the immune system. [519] Playing video games to pass time during quarantine can prevent the virus from spreading. [520] Flavanols and proanthocyanidins which are chemicals found in dark chocolate , grapes and green tea may block SARS-CoV-2 proteins. [521] Places you are most likely to catch the virus are churches, hair and nail salons, cruise ships, hospitals and the doctor’s office, restaurants and bars, theaters, sporting events, concert venues, buses, restrooms, elevators, the gym, airplanes, hotels, public swimming pools, nightclubs and the beach. [522] Vaccinated people still need to wear a mask. [523] Flying in a private jet can prevent the spread of coronavirus. [524]

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever
A fever is when a person's body temperature is hotter than 37.5 degrees Celsius (99.5 Fahrenheit ). Normal body temperature for humans varies based on a variety of factors, including age and level of physical activity. [1] It is typically cited as 37 degrees Celsius (98.6 F), but naturally varies from person to person by at least .5 degrees Celsius. The actual measurement of body temperature will vary based on the location of the measurement.  For a temperature taken from under the tongue , the measurement may be lower. Rectal temperatures will read about 0.3 C (0.55 F) higher, and armpit temperatures will read about the same amount lower.
When people are ill, their body's immune system fights the disease , and so the body temperature rises. Fever is a defensive measure of the body against the germs: the life cycles of the germs are disrupted when the body temperature rises.
About 38 °C (100.4 F) degrees is called a low-grade fever, and above 39.5 °C (103 F) degrees is a high-grade fever.
Children usually have a higher fever than adults; their immune system is less mature. Infants have the highest normal temperature, which decreases as people age. Some animals, especially small ones like rabbits and cats , also have a higher normal temperature than humans.
Sometimes, high-grade fever can be a medical emergency . At or above 42 °C (107.6 F) organs start taking damage that may not be repairable. While most fevers are caused by Infection , whether bacterial or viral, some fevers can be caused by cancers, including leukemia , [2] lymphoma , [3] and renal cell carcinoma . [4]

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cough
A cough , also known as tussis , is an action the body takes to get rid of anything that irritates the lungs or throat. To do this, muscles in the thoracic cavity contract to make air leave the lungs with a lot of force. Coughs often happen quickly and more than once, and are usually accompanied by a unique sound, also called a cough.
Coughs are more likely to happen when a person is sick, because infections often irritate breathing passages. Another cause of coughs is a person breathing air that is not clean like dust .

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue
Fatigue or tiredness is a physical or mental feeling. It happens when someone is ready to sleep or has done a lot of physical exercise . The person may feel weak, slow or sleepy. They may yawn , and may find it difficult to keep the eyes open. Usual fatigue goes away when you rest or sleep.
Fatigue may also be caused by physical or mental illness , jet lag , drug or alcohol use, medications , blood loss , malnutrition , starvation, stress or boredom .

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runny_nose
Mucus (mucous), or slime, is a slippery liquid. It is made by many living things as a kind of biological lubricant . It plays the role in living things which oil plays in machines.
Mucus is mainly composed of polysaccharides , which are long-chain carbohydrates . These molecules are stiff when dry, and sticky and slippery when wet. They are present in all types of organisms from bacteria to humans.
In vertebrates mucus is made by mucous membranes . Mucus may have antiseptic enzymes (such as lysozymes ) and immunoglobulins ( antigens ). [1] A major function of this mucus is to protect against infection by fungi , bacteria and viruses .
Mucus protects epithelial cells in the lungs , gut , genital , visual, and auditory systems in mammals ; the epidermis in amphibians ; and the gills in fish . Snails , slugs , hagfish , and certain invertebrates also produce external mucus. As well as a protective function, slime helps movement and plays a role in communication.
Mucus is produced in many parts of the body. All the alimentary canal , nose, and sexual organs have mucus glands which pass the mucus to the surfaces. The surfaces are mostly internal surfaces, though in some animals mucus covers the outside of the animal. Slugs are an example of this. Mucus glands are exocrine glands , so they pass their mucus to the surface along ducts .
In the human digestive system , mucus is used as a lubricant for materials that must pass over membranes , such as food passing down the oesophagus .
A layer of mucus along the inner walls of the stomach is vital to protect the cell linings from the highly acidic environment inside the stomach. [2] Mucus is not digested in the intestinal tract.
Alkaline mucus is also found in other places, such as eyes , saliva and cervix . [3]
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell
The job of white blood cells (also called leukocytes ) is to fight infections and cancer . They also remove poison, waste and damaged cells from the body. [1] [2]
The number of white blood cells increases when a person is fighting infection or disease and decrease when a person is healthy.
Lymphocytes are round white blood cells a bit bigger than a red blood cell . Their center is round and they have little cytoplasm . Part of the lymphatic system , these target specific germs or poisons using their antibodies . There are three known types of lymphocytes, called T-cells , B-cells , and natural killer cells (NK cells).
B-cells make antibodies , which are little molecules that attach to viruses or bad cells. These tell other cells to destroy the viruses or bad cells, like a flag.
T-cells can either help make more B-cells, or kill cells with antibodies. [1]
Natural killer cells kill cells in the body that have been infected by a virus or that are part of a tumor. They are part of the innate immune system .
Monocytes are reserve cells which turn into macrophages and dendritic cells , which work together in tissues to fight disease. Monocytes have a kidney bean shaped center and lots of cytoplasm . They may appear as macrophages in a non-round shape when they pass through tissue to eat germs , "junk" cells, and dead cells.
The next three types of white blood cells are referred to as granulocytes since they all contain rough, grain-like particles that assist in attacking viruses and bacteria . Granulocytes are also called polymorphonuclear leukocytes because of the shape of the nucleus , which has three segments.
Neutrophils are the most abundant type of white blood cells in mammals , 70% of leukocytes. They are an essential part of the immune system . They get to the site of an injury within minutes, and make up much of the content of pus . They have a short life-span of a couple of days.
The nucleus , which looks like a string of beads , does not take up stain strongly. Like phagocytes , they actually eat the bacteria and dead cells. They also release a bunch of proteins which work to damage the bacteria.
Basophils , or basophil granulocytes, are rare granulocytes. If you collected 1000 white blood cells, only 1–3 of them would be basophils. Their nucleus is hidden by granules which turn dark blue in color when stained. Basophils carry histamine and heparin . They appear at the sites of ecto parasite infection, or allergies . We don't know exactly how they work. [1]
Eosinophils , or acidophils , are leukocytes. They are one of the immune system components which combat parasites and certain infections. As with mast cells and basophils , they part causes of allergy and asthma . Eosinophils are round cells with a lobed nucleus and granules which turn red when stained. These granules are packed with proteins that can be poured out to help destroy invaders.
A test called a differential count shows how many white blood cells there are in a person's blood, and how many of each type are there.
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_failure
Kidney failure (also called renal failure ) is a term used to describe when a person's kidneys stop working properly, or fail. Kidney failure can be divided into two categories: chronic renal failure, and acute renal failure.
Chronic renal failure develops slowly, and there are not many noticeable symptoms at first.
Chronic renal failure can be a sign of other diseases, like IgA nephritis , glomerulonephritis , chronic pyelonephritis , and urinary retention .
Chronic renal failure will eventually develop into end-stage renal failure if it is left untreated. End-stage renal failure can only be treated with dialysis or a kidney transplant .
Acute renal failure develops in a short time, and symptoms are more noticeable. Symptoms include:
The cause of acute renal failure needs to be found quickly. Dialysis is often needed to prevent permanent damage to the body while the cause is being found.
It is possible to have acute renal failure on top of chronic renal failure. This is called "acute-on-chronic renal failure."
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia
Pneumonia is a disease of the lungs and the respiratory system . The lung contains many small bulbs, or sacs, called alveoli . These help to take out oxygen from the air . In the case of pneumonia, these bulbs become inflamed . They fill up with a fluid which is called pus , and can no longer absorb as much oxygen as before. This makes it hard for the person with pneumonia to breathe. They may feel out of breath, or like they are drowning.  They may also feel pain when they breathe.  Sometimes people die of pneumonia, even when they go to a hospital and take medicine.
Pneumonia can be caused by bacteria , viruses , fungi or parasites . It can also be caused by chemical or physical damage done to the lungs. Other illnesses, like alcohol abuse or lung cancer , can also result in pneumonia.
People with pneumonia usually have difficulty breathing . They may also cough , or have pains in the chest area. The treatment of pneumonia depends on how the illness was caused. If it was caused by bacteria, antibiotics can be used to treat it.
People of all ages can have pneumonia. The disease is dangerous. Many people die from pneumonia, especially old people, or people with a weak immune system .
According to some research in 2010, in some parts of the world where people are very poor like India , Nigeria , and Pakistan , pneumonia was the cause of death for more children under the age of five than any other disease.  Statistically, however, for every 2,000 children in the developing world who die of pneumonia, only one child in the developed world dies from the disease.  This is because of differences in health care and because of differences in rates of breastfeeding , not because of differences in children.  Breastfeeding newborn babies greatly increases their ability to survive pneumonia, but some cultures think of breastfeeding as taboo . [1]
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_organ_dysfunction_syndrome
Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome ( MODS ), previously known as multiple organ failure ( MOF ), Total organ failure ( TOF ) or multisystem organ failure ( MSOF ), is when the organ function is acutely ill and the patient is required medical intervention to achieve homeostasis . It usually involves two or more organ systems. [1]
The use of "multiple organ failure" or "multisystem organ failure" should be avoided since that phrase was based upon physiological parameters to determine whether or not a particular organ was failing. [1]
The condition usually results from infection, injury (accident, surgery), hypoperfusion and hypermetabolism . The primary cause triggers an uncontrolled inflammatory response . Sepsis is the most common cause in operative and non-operative patients. Sepsis may result in septic shock .
Four clinical phases have been suggested:
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_cold
The common cold [1] is caused by viruses . It spreads easily, so it is very infectious .  The symptoms are mostly in the upper respiratory system . Its damage is mostly felt in the nose and throat. The symptoms include coughs , painful throat, runny nose and fever . These symptoms usually last seven to ten days, but sometimes up to three weeks. Over two hundred different viruses can cause the common cold : [2] that is why the details vary so much. Rhinoviruses are the most common cause.
The common cold mostly hurts the nose, pharynx , throat, and the sinuses ( sinusitis ). The symptoms come from the immune system 's response to the infection, not from direct destruction by the viruses themselves. Hand washing is good, but the viruses also spread through moist air. Close contact with infected people is common in many cities. Wearing face masks might help, especially on any mass transit system (railways, underground, buses...).
There is no cure for the common cold, but the symptoms can be treated. It is the most frequent infectious disease in humans. The average person gets two to three colds every year. The average child gets between 6 and 12 colds every year. These colds have been with humans for as long as we have a history.
The most common symptoms of a cold are a cough, runny nose, a stuffy nose, and a sore throat. Other issues are sore muscles , feeling tired , headache , and not wanting to eat. [3] Around 40% of people with colds have a sore throat, while around 50% have a cough. [4] Muscle ache happens in about half of the cases. [5] A fever is an uncommon symptom in adults, but it is common in infants and young children. [5] The cough caused by a cold is usually mild compared to a cough caused by influenza (the flu). [5] A cough and a fever indicate a higher likelihood of the flu in adults. [6] A number of the viruses that cause the common cold may also result in no symptoms. [7] [8] The color of the mucus that is coughed up from the lungs (sputum) may vary in color from clear to yellow to green. This color does not indicate if an infection is caused by viruses or bacteria . [9]
A cold usually begins with feeling tired, a feeling of being chilled, sneezing , and a headache. Additional symptoms such as runny nose and cough follow within two or more days. [3] Symptoms typically reach their worst two to three days after the infection begins. [5] Symptoms usually end after seven to ten days, but can last up to three weeks. [10] The cough lasts for more than ten days in 35% to 40% of cases involving children. It lasts for more than 25 days in 10% of cases involving children. [11]
The common cold is an easily spread infection of the upper respiratory tract. Rhinoviruses cause 30% to 80% of all cases. A rhinovirus is an RNA-containing virus . There are 99 known types of this kind of virus. [12] [13]
Other viruses can also cause the common cold. Coronavirus causes 10% to 15% of cases. The flu causes 5% to 15% of cases. [5] Often, more than one virus is present and causing the infection. [14] In total, over two hundred different viruses are associated with colds. [5] [15]
The common cold virus is usually spread in one of two main ways. By breathing or swallowing droplets in the air containing the virus; or by contacting infected nasal mucus or contaminated objects. [4] [16] The most common method of transmitting the cold virus has not been determined. [17] The viruses may survive for a long time in the environment. Viruses may then be transmitted from the hands to the eyes or nose where infection occurs. [16] People sitting close together appear at greater risk of becoming infected. [17] Transmission is common in day cares and at schools, due to the closeness of many children with little immunity and frequently poor hygiene . [18] These infections are then brought home to other members of the family. [18] There is no evidence that the air on commercial flights transmits cold viruses. [16] Rhinoviruses are most infectious in the first three days of cold symptoms. They are much less infectious afterwards. [19]
The traditional theory was that the disease spread to someone staying too long in cold weather , rain, or winter conditions. This is how the disease got its name. [20] The role of body cooling as a risk factor for the common cold is controversial. [21] Some common cold viruses are seasonal, found more often in cold or wet weather. [22] This is believed to mostly be due to more time spent indoors, close to each other; [23] specifically children returning to school. [18] Still, changes in the respiratory system may result in easier infections. [23] Dry air may increase transmission rates by allowing small easily spread droplets to spread farther and stay in the air longer. [24]
Herd immunity , immunity that occurs when an entire group of people become immune to a particular infection, occurs from previous exposure to cold viruses. Thus younger populations have greater rates of respiratory infections and older populations have lower rates of respiratory infections. [25] Poor immune function is also a risk factor for disease. [25] [26] Lack of sleep and poor nutrition have also been associated with a greater risk of developing infection following rhinovirus exposure. This is believed to be due to their effects on immune function. [27] [28]
The symptoms of the common cold are believed to be mostly related to the immune response to the virus. [29] The mechanism of this immune response is virus-specific. For example, the rhinovirus is typically acquired by direct contact. It binds to human ICAM-1 receptors through unknown methods to trigger the release of inflammatory mediators. [29] These inflammatory mediators then produce the symptoms. [29] It does not generally cause damage to the nasal epithelium . [5]
In contrast, the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is contacted by both direct contact and airborne droplets. It then replicates in the nose and throat before frequently spreading to the lower respiratory tract. [30] RSV does cause epithelium damage. [30]
Human parainfluenza virus typically results in inflammation of the nose, throat, and airways. [31] In young children, when it affects the trachea it may produce croup , a hoarse cough and difficulty breathing . This is due to the small size of the airway in children. [31]
The distinction between different upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) is loosely based on the location of the symptoms. The common cold primarily affects the nose, pharyngitis primarily affects the throat, and bronchitis primarily affects the lungs. [4] The common cold is frequently defined as inflammation of the nose and may include varying amounts of throat inflammation. [32] Self- diagnosis is common. [5] Isolation of the actual viral agent involved is rarely performed. [32] It is generally not possible to identify the specific virus through symptoms. [5]
The only effective way to prevent the common cold is by physically preventing the spread of the viruses. [33] This primarily includes hand washing and wearing face masks. In the health care environment, gowns and disposable gloves are also worn. [33] Isolating infected individuals is not possible because the disease is so widespread and symptoms are not specific. Vaccination has proved difficult because there are so many viruses involved and the viruses undergo rapid change. [33] Developing a broadly effective vaccine is very unlikely. [34]
Regular hand washing reduces the spread of cold viruses. It is most effective and is especially recommended for use in children, due to a lack of evidence supporting the effectiveness of over-the-counter cold medicines for children, and due to the risk for harm from those medicines. [35] [36] In 2009, Canada restricted the use of over-the-counter cough and cold medication in children six years old and younger due to concerns regarding risks and unproven benefits. [35] The misuse of dextromethorphan (an over-the-counter cough medicine) has led to its ban in a number of countries. [37]
In adults, the symptoms of a runny nose can be reduced by first-generation antihistamines . However, first-generation antihistamines are associated with adverse side effects such as drowsiness. [38] Other decongestants such as pseudoephedrine are also effective in adults. [39] Ipratropium nasal spray may reduce the symptoms of a runny nose, but there is little effect on stuffiness. [40] Second-generation antihistamines do not appear to be effective. [41]
Due to the lack of studies, it is not known whether drinking more fluids improves symptoms or shortens respiratory illness. [42] A similar lack of data exists for the use of heated humidified air. [43] One study found chest vapor rub to be effective in providing some symptomatic relief of night-time cough, congestion, and sleep difficulty. [44]
Antibiotics have no effect against viral infections and thus have no effect against the common cold. [45] Antibiotics are often prescribed even though antibiotic side effects cause overall harm. [45] [46] Antibiotics are commonly prescribed because people expect doctors to prescribe them, and doctors want to help people. Prescribing antibiotics also happens because it is difficult to exclude causes of infection that may be managed by antibiotics. [47] There are no effective antiviral drugs for the common cold, even though some preliminary research has shown benefit. [38] [48]
While there are many alternative treatments used for the common cold, there is not enough scientific evidence to support the use of most treatments. [38] As of 2010, there is not enough evidence to recommend for or against either honey or nasal irrigation. [49] [50] Zinc supplements may reduce the severity and duration of symptoms when taken within 24 hours of their onset. [51] The effect of vitamin C on the common cold, while extensively researched, is disappointing. [52] [53] Evidence about the usefulness of echinacea is inconsistent. [54] [55] Different types of echinacea supplements may vary in their effectiveness. [54]
The common cold is generally mild and goes away on its own with most symptoms improving in one week. [4] Severe complications, if they occur, are usually in the very old, the very young, or those who are immunosuppressed (have a weakened immune system). [56] Secondary bacterial infections may occur resulting in sinusitis, pharyngitis, or an ear infection . [57] It is estimated that sinusitis occurs in 8% of cases. Ear infections occur in 30% of cases. [58]
The common cold is the most common human disease [56] and people are affected all around the world. [18] Adults typically have two to five infections per year. [4] [5] Children may have six to ten colds per year (and up to twelve colds per year for school children). [38] Rates of symptomatic infections increase in the elderly due to a weakening immune system. [25]
While the cause of the common cold has been known since only the 1950s, the disease has been with humanity since ancient times . [59] Its symptoms and treatment are described in the Egyptian Ebers papyrus , the oldest existing medical text, written before the 16th century BC . [60] The name "common cold" came into use in the 16th century , due to the similarity between its symptoms and those of exposure to cold weather. [61]
In the United Kingdom , the Common Cold Unit (CCU) was set up by the Medical Research Council in 1946, and it was here that the rhinovirus was discovered in 1956. [62] In the 1970s, the CCU demonstrated that treatment with interferon during the incubation phase of rhinovirus infection provided some protection against the disease. [63] No practical treatment could be developed. The unit was closed in 1989, two years after it completed research of zinc gluconate lozenges in the prevention and treatment of rhinovirus colds. Zinc was the only successful treatment developed in the history of the CCU. [64]
The economic impact of the common cold is poorly understood in much of the world. [58] In the United States, the common cold leads to 75 million to 100 million physician visits annually, costing at least $7.7 billion per year (by conservative cost estimates). Americans spend $2.9 billion on over-the-counter (OTC) drugs. Americans spend an additional $400 million on prescription medicines for symptomatic relief. [65] More than one-third of people who saw a doctor received an antibiotic prescription. The use of antibiotic prescriptions has implications for antibiotic resistance . [65] An estimated 22 million to 189 million school days are missed each year due to a cold. As a result, parents missed 126 million workdays to stay home to care for their children. When added to the 150 million workdays missed by employees suffering from a cold, the total economic impact of cold-related work loss exceeds $20 billion per year. [15] [65] This accounts for 40% of time lost from work in the United States. [66]
A number of antivirals have been tested for effectiveness in the common cold.  As of 2009, none have been both found effective and licensed for use. [48] There are ongoing trials of the antiviral drug pleconaril. It shows promise against picornaviruses. There are also ongoing trials of BTA-798. [67] The oral form of pleconaril had safety issues and an aerosol form is being studied. [67]
Researchers from the University of Maryland , College Park and the University of Wisconsin–Madison have mapped the genome for all known virus strains that cause the common cold. [68]
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measles
Measles is an infectious disease , caused by a virus . People catch measles from other people. It is passed on in tiny drops of water when people breathe . People with measles have a sore throat , a fever , a cough , red eyes and a runny nose . They also have a bumpy red rash all over their body. These rashes will cause a high irritation of itching.
Measles is very infectious, which means it is easy to catch. If someone in a house has measles, it is very likely that other people in the house will also get it. In developed countries , lots of children have a vaccination ( injection ) to stop them from getting measles. Often they are given the MMR vaccine , to stop them getting measles, mumps and rubella . The three vaccinations are all in one injection.
Measles is sometimes also called rubeola , but it is not the same as rubella (German measles). The German Measles (rubella) was discovered by German scientists.
There is no cure for measles. People with measles may rest and take medicines to make them feel better, to stop pain and make fevers go away. Most people that have measles recover, but some people die from it.
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization
The World Health Organization ( WHO ) is part of the United Nations (UN), working on international public health , with its headquarters in Geneva , Switzerland . The WHO was established by the UN on April 7, 1948. In the previous year they had already started an epidemiology service. WHO World Health Day is celebrated on April 7.

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_exchange
Exchange of gases or gas exchange is carried out by organisms , where different gases move in different directions. Animals , microorganisms and plants breathe out carbon dioxide and breathe in oxygen . To balance the composition of air , plants use carbon dioxide to carry out photosynthesis , so oxygen is made. Plants only carry this out during the day, when there is sunlight. Plants respire all day and night.
In humans, gas exchange happens in the alveolus ( alveoli for plural). These are in the lungs and help with diffusion. Oxygen diffuses into the bloodstream, from the air. Oxygen is used in aerobic respiration . Carbon dioxide diffuses out of the bloodstream, into the air. Carbon dioxide is a waste product made by respiration .
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surfactant
A surfactant is a chemical that lowers the surface tension of a liquid . Less surface tension lets the liquid soak into things better, and can also let bubbles form easier. A liquid that bubbles and soaks into things is better at cleaning, so surfactants are used in soap .
Every year, 15 million tons of surfactants are made. Half of them are used in soap; the rest are used in many different ways including making toothpaste and concrete . [1]
One popular surfactant is sodium laurel sulfate, also called sodium dodecyl sulfate or SDS. SDS is a cheap, commonly used surfactant that is used in almost every toothpaste and many shampoos, body washes, and shaving creams.
Small amounts of most common surfactants are usually not harmful to people or animals, although if they get into eyes they can be painful.  Very large amounts of surfactants can kill animals, but the amount varies depending on the surfactant.
Larger amounts of surfactants can be a problem in the environment , where they let the soil hold more water than usual, but this problem usually goes away in a few days.
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A
Bird flu (also called avian influenza , avian flu , bird influenza , or grippe of the birds ), is an illness caused by a virus . The virus, called influenza A or type A , usually lives in birds , but sometimes infects mammals , including humans . It is called influenza when it infects humans.
There are many types of influenza A, which was first found in a bird in Italy in 1878. Most types have weak symptoms , such as breathing problems, similar to the common cold .
But some types kill birds, and a few kill humans and other mammals. One type of bird flu, called Spanish flu , killed 50 to 100 million people [1] in 1918/1920. Another type, called Asian Flu killed one million in 1957, and another one, called Hong Kong Flu , also killed one million people in 1968.
A subtype, called H5N1 , killed six people in Hong Kong in 1997, but did not kill again until 2003, this time in China . Until the middle of 2005, it was primarily found in southeast Asia but since then has spread to parts of Africa and Europe . It has killed tens of millions of birds and resulted in the slaughter of hundreds of millions of other birds to limit its spread. So far it is mostly a bird disease and rarely infects humans. The concern about H5N1 is that it is constantly evolving at a very fast rate and could create a human flu pandemic that could kill many millions of people. Governments around the world are spending billions of dollars to deal with this problem: studying H5N1, creating vaccines, conducting pandemic practice exercises, stockpiling useful flu medication, and many other important activities.

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelial_cells
Epithelium (plural: epithelia) is one of the four main types of tissue in the body of animals . It is made up of one or more layers of cells .
The outermost layer of the skin is a special type of epithelium. It has an important function : it forms a mechanical defence against infection : see innate immunity .
Epithelia are found on the surface of organs and many other parts of the body. One main function of epithelia is moving fluids into or out of an organ or body part. It also protects organs and carries sense organs .
There are many different types of epithelium that do different things in the body, including the excretory system. The epithelium covers blood vessels and hollow organs such as the stomach and kidneys.  All glands are made from epithelial cells. In some areas, the epithelium secretes sweat, oil, or mucus .
Functions of epithelial cells include secretion, selective absorption, protection, transcellular transport, and sensing. Epithelial layers have no blood vessels: they get oxygen and nourishment from the underlying connective tissue , through the basement membrane. [1] [2]

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University
Columbia University (officially Columbia University in the City of New York ) is a research university in the United States . It is an Ivy League university and often considered one of the best in the world. It is the fifth oldest college in the United States.
It was ranked 2nd best college in the United States by Times Higher Education in 2017. It was ranked 8th best university in the world by U.S. News & World Report.
The university was founded as King's College by royal charter from King George II of Great Britain . It was the first college in New York , and the fifth college in the Thirteen Colonies . A lot of the money that paid for the school came from slavery . [1] After the American Revolution it was renamed "Columbia College" in 1784 and renamed once again to "Columbia University" in 1896 when it moved to its current location in Morningside Heights.
Ninety-Six Nobel Prize winners have been produced by Columbia, the second most in the United States after Harvard University . Five Founding Fathers attended Columbia: Alexander Hamilton , John Jay , Robert Livingston, Gouverneur Morris and Egbert Benson. Three U.S. Presidents have attended Columbia: Barack Obama , Franklin D. Roosevelt , and Theodore Roosevelt . Ten Supreme Court Justices have attended Columbia including the most recent Associate Justice, Neil Gorsuch , and the first Chief Justice, John Jay. Other famous alumni include: Warren Buffett , Madeline Albright , and Lou Gehrig .
Columbia is home to the Pulitzer Prize for good work in journalism , literature and music .  Columbia is where FM radio was created. The school is where the foundation of modern genetics was discovered. Its Morningside Heights campus was the first North American site where the uranium atom was split.
Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons and College of Dental Medicine are located in Washington Heights in Northern Manhattan .

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johns_Hopkins_University
The Johns Hopkins University is a private research university in Baltimore, Maryland in the United States. Johns Hopkins opened in 1876 as part of a seven million dollar donation to start a number of institutions under his name. Johns Hopkins does more than 1.5 billion dollars of science research every year. [5] During the pandemic , the university has been doing researching on the outbreak .

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone
Hormones are the chemical messengers of the endocrine system . Hormones are the signals which adjust the body's internal working, together with the nervous system . [1] Every multicellular organism has hormones. The cells which react to a given hormone have special receptors for that hormone. When a hormone attaches to the receptor protein a mechanism for signalling is started. [2] The cell or tissue that gets the message is called the 'target'. Hormones only act on cells which have the right receptors.
Many different kinds of cells can send a message. There are some cells whose main job is to make hormones. When many of these cells are together, they are called a gland . Glands are groups of cells that make something and release it (put it outside the cell). Many glands make hormones.
"Endocrine" means secreting directly into the blood. Most internal secretions are from endocrine glands . The opposite word is "exocrine", which means secreting through a duct or tube. Some hormones are produced by exocrine glands , and some exocrine secretions release outside the body. Sweat glands and salivary glands are examples of exocrine glands whose products are released outside the body.
The first discovery of a hormone was made in 1902. The hormone was secretin . The word 'hormone' was first used in 1905. [3]
Hormones do many things. They regulate metabolism . Metabolism is the chemical and energy reactions that happen in a living thing. Hormones cause the growth and death of cells and of whole organisms. Hormones also start and control sexual development. For example, the hormones estrogen and progesterone make girls go through puberty . Hormones help keep homeostasis in an organism. Homeostasis means to keep a constant state inside the body like temperature, amount of water and salts, and amount of sugar. Hormones released by one gland can also tell other glands to make different hormones.
There are four types of hormones in most vertebrates . They are grouped by the chemicals from which they are made.
In biology regulation means to control something. So regulating hormones means controlling how much hormones are made and released from cells.
Hormone regulation is mostly done by negative feedback . In negative feedback, a hormone causes an effect. The cells that make the hormone detect this effect and its production ceases.
A good example of negative feedback is with the hormone insulin . Insulin is produced by the pancreas . Insulin is released by the pancreas in response to consumption of glucose . The amount of glucose in the blood rises, and the pancreas detects the increase. It then secretes insulin into the blood. Insulin increases glucose uptake in target cells. Some glucose is used by the cells but some is also converted to and stored in the form of glycogen .  Glucose uptake by cells decreases blood glucose levels. This decrease is detected by the pancreas and in response, it stops secreting insulin in to the bloodstream. As insulin levels in the blood decrease, so does glucose uptake by cells.
This negative feedback therefore helps to maintain normal blood glucose levels and prevents extreme changes.
There are three main types of hormones. Steroid hormones are non-polar and do not need a receptor. The second type is peptide hormones.  The third is Tyrosine derived hormones. An example is the T3 and T4 hormones produced by the thyroid gland .
Often two hormones control the same product, one increasing and the other decreasing the target. Blood glucose is very important to an organism, and is controlled by more than one hormone. Other hormones also make the glucose level go up or down. If the glucose level gets too low, the body releases hormones that do the opposite of insulin. They do not tell the cells in the body to take up glucose from the blood. They tell the cells to put glucose back into the blood. These kind of hormones that work opposite of other hormones are called counter-regulatory hormones. Counter-regulatory hormones for insulin are glucagon and epinephrine .
Most important things in an organism are kept in homeostasis by negative feedback and counter-regulatory hormones. However a few things are controlled in different ways. One rare way is positive feedback. In negative feedback, the hormone's effect makes a gland stop making hormones. In positive feedback the opposite happens. The effect of the hormone tells the gland to make even more hormones.
An example of positive feedback is the hormone that causes childbirth (when babies are born.) The hormone that causes this is oxytocin . This hormone is made by the pituitary gland . When the baby starts coming out, it stretches the muscle in the cervix (the bottom of the uterus ). Nerves in the cervix send a message to the pituitary. This message makes the pituitary release more oxytocin. The oxytocin then causes the muscles of the uterus to contract, or squeeze. This causes more stretching in the cervix. This stretching then tells the pituitary to make even more oxytocin. So levels of oxytocin keep rising until the squeezing or contractions of the uterus force the baby out.
There are clear distinctions between hormones and neurotransmitters :
Most hormones start a cellular response by binding to cell membranes or receptors inside the cell. A cell may have several different receptor types that recognize the same hormone but activate different signal transduction pathways, or a cell may have several different receptors that recognize different hormones and activate the same biochemical pathway.
Hormones are defined functionally, not structurally. They may have various chemical structures. Hormones occur in multicellular organisms ( plants , animals , fungi , brown algae and red algae ). These compounds occur also in unicellular organisms , and may act as signalling molecules, [5] [6]
Peptide hormones are hormones with a short chain of amino acids.

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosterone
Testosterone is an androgen sex hormone . A hormone is one that is made from cholesterol . A sex hormone is one that regulates sexual changes in the body. An androgen is the male type of sex hormone.
The testicles of men make lots of testosterone. Ovaries and adrenal glands make testosterone too. But they make much less than the testicles do. So men have much higher testosterone levels than women. The process takes place during the ages of puberty for both males and females
Testosterone has two different kinds of effects. One effect is anabolic . This effect causes growth of muscle and bone. The other effect of testosterone is androgenic . These effects make the body look male. This includes the effects that boys have at puberty: growing a beard, making the penis and testicles bigger, and making the voice deeper.

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pollution
Air pollution is a type of environmental pollution that affects the air and is usually caused by smoke or other harmful gases, mainly oxides of carbon , sulphur and nitrogen .
In other words, air pollution is the contamination of air due to the presence or introduction of a substance which has a poisonous effect.
Many of the world's large cities today have polluted air or low air and complain about it daily quality . [1]
Even 2,000 years ago, the Romans were complaining about the polluted air in their cities. At that time, the air was thick with smoke from fires and the smell of sewers . [1] Air pollution has been classified as a danger to human health and Earth 's many ecosystems for a long time.
Pollution can be gas or liquid or solid . It can also be classified chemically, such as:- oxide, hydrocarbon, acid or other kinds. Pollution can also be classified by what makes it.
Many pollutants go into the air from natural sources . These pollutants include dust, sea salt , volcanic ashes and gases , smoke from forest fires, pollen , and many other materials . [1] In fact, there are many more natural pollutants than pollutants that humans make. [1] However, humans and other living things have adapted to most of these natural pollutants. [1]
Air pollution is usually described as either primary pollutants or secondary pollutants .Primary pollutants are pollutants that are put directly into the air by humans or natural sources. Examples of primary pollutants are exhaust fumes ( gas ) from cars , soot from smoke, dust storms and ash from volcanic eruptions (as seen in the picture on the left). [1]
Secondary pollutants are pollutants that are made from chemical reactions when pollutants mix with other primary pollutants or natural substances like water vapor . [1] Many secondary pollutants are made when a primary pollutant reacts with sunlight . Ozone and smog are secondary pollutants. Ozone is a gas that stops harmful ultraviolet rays from the sun .  When it is near the ground, though, it can poison people and other organisms. [1]
Human-made air pollution comes from many things. Most air pollution made by humans today is because of transportation . Automobiles , for instance, make about 60% of the human-made air pollution. The gases inside car exhaust, like nitrogen oxide , make smog and acid rain .
Farmlands and forests sometimes burn in wildfires producing soot (a black powder composed mainly of carbon, produced when coal, grasses, wood etc. is burned) from smoke. Soot can affect people and other life. People start many of those fires.
Many industrial power plants burn fossil fuels to get their energy. However, burning fossil fuels can make a lot of oxides ( chemical compounds that have oxygen and other elements inside). In fact, the burning of fossil fuels makes 96% of the sulphur oxides in the atmosphere . Some industries also make chemicals that make poisonous fumes (smoke).
Air pollution is not only on the outside. Homes, schools, and buildings can also have air pollution. Sometimes the air inside a building is even worse than the air outside. [1] Many things which humans use every day can pollute the air. Compounds inside carpets, paints, building materials and furniture also pollute the air, especially when they are new.
In buildings where the windows are tightly shut to stop air leaks, the air inside can be polluted more than the air outside. [1]
Acid precipitation is precipitation , like rain , sleet , or snow , that contains acids from air pollution. When fossil fuels are burned, they let out oxides into the air. When these oxides mix with water in the atmosphere, they make acid, which fall as precipitation. [1] Acid precipitation can kill living things like fish and trees, by making the place where they live too acidic . Acid rain can also damage buildings made of limestone and concrete .
A global concern is the hole in the ozone layer in the stratosphere .  The Earth's ozone layer protects life from the Sun's harmful ultraviolet rays, but in the 1970s, scientists found out that some chemicals let out into the atmosphere makes the ozone turn into oxygen .  This lets more ultraviolet rays reach the Earth.  During the 1980s, scientists found that the ozone layer above the South Pole had thinned by 50 to 98%.
On March 17, 1992, in Mexico City , all children under the age of 14 could not go to school because of air pollution. This does not often happen, but being exposed to air pollution every day can make people have many health problems. Children, elderly (old) people, and people with allergies especially, can have a lot of problems because of air pollution. Studies from the University of Birmingham showed that deaths because of pneumonia and air pollution from motor vehicles like cars are related . [2]
The World Health Organization said that 2.4 million people died because of the direct problems of air pollution. [3] [4] Some of the problems include: [1]
In India in 2014, it was reported that air pollution had cut crop yields in the most affected areas by almost half in 2010 when compared to 1980 levels. There can also be increased yield of crops due to some air quality conditions.
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_dioxide
Nitrogen dioxide is a chemical compound . Its chemical formula is NO 2 . It contains nitrogen and oxide ions . The nitrogen is in the +4 oxidation state .
Nitrogen Dioxide is a reddish-brown gas with a distinct, pungent odor similar to that of Chlorine. It causes significant and damaging pulmonary effects when it is inhaled, due to the formation of both Nitric (HNO3) & Nitrous (HNO2) acids when it reacts with Water present in the lungs. When Nitrogen Dioxide is compressed or cooled to near 0° C, two molecules of the Dioxide bond, forming the colorless Dinitrogen Tetroxide . It is a strong oxidizing agent . Upon heating, Nitrogen Dioxide decomposes back into lower oxides of Nitrogen (NO) as well as Oxygen. It reacts with iodides to form nitrites and elemental iodine . The presence of NO2 in concentrated Nitric acid causes the acid to take on a yellow color, depending on the concentration of the dissolved gas.
Nitrogen dioxide is normally made by oxidation of nitric oxide by oxygen in air. It can also be made by heating some nitrates . It can be made by reacting concentrated nitric acid with copper or tin .
It is used to make nitric acid by dissolving it in water. Nitric oxide is also released.
Nitrogen dioxide is very toxic. It has a foul odor, which aids in its detection. Much care should be taken to avoid contact with this compound.
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_mask
A surgical mask , also known as a procedure mask , medical mask or simply as a face mask , [1] [2] is a  mask. It is intended to be worn by health professionals during surgery and during nursing . Such masks are used to catch the bacteria shed in liquid droplets and aerosol s from the wearer's mouth and nose. They are not designed to protect the wearer from inhaling airborne bacteria or virus particles and are less effective than respirators , which provide better protection.
There are different qualities of such mask. Despite their name, not all surgical masks should be used during surgeries. Chinese health officials distinguish between medical (non-surgical) and surgical masks. [3]
Surgical masks are made of a nonwoven fabric created using a melt blowing process.  They came into use in the 1960s and largely replaced cloth facemasks in developed countries .  A shortage of surgical masks is a central issue of the ongoing 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic . [4] [5]
Surgical masks are popularly worn by the general public all year round in East Asian countries like China , Japan and South Korea to reduce the chance of spreading airborne diseases to others, and to prevent the breathing in of airborne dust particles created by air pollution . [6] Additionally, surgical masks have become a fashion statement, particularly in contemporary East Asian culture bolstered by its popularity in Japanese and Korean pop culture which have a big impact on East Asian youth culture . [7] [8]
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public
In communication science and public relations, "public" mostly means people. [1] [2] The meaning of this is different than other ideas, such as gatherings in social life to talk about people (public sphere). [1] The meaning of this is also talked about in the learning of government (political science), the learning of how humans think (psychology), and the learning of giving things to people (marketing). This word's meaning is very hard to make, as people think that public has different meanings. [3]
The word "public" comes from the Latin publicus , or "of the people".
In the learning of government (politics), "public" means a group of people who are related to government (leader group). In psychology and public relations, public has even more different meanings.
In the year of 1929, John Dewey had [4] the meaning of "public" as a group of people who answer the same problem. This means that this meaning is about problems (situational). [3] This definition of "public" with "problem" is so misunderstood that people made a whole new learning place, called as "the idea of the public being about problems" (situational theory of publics) created by James E Gruning, [5] who was so into "the idea of the public being about problems” that he also thought of “the idea of the public not being about problems", and so made sets that put the ideas of the meaning of public in order. This includes "the idea of a public without a problem" (nonpublics), "the idea of public with a problem" (latent publics), and "the idea of public who know they have a problem" (active publics). [6]
In this meaning, the meaning of “public” is not someone who likes business (stakeholder) or a system of getting and giving things for money (market). This meaning of "public" here is that it is a part of a group of multiple people who like business (stakeholder) who all need to solve a problem. This is not a market because it does not have any money moving system (exchange system), and that a "public" is created by itself (self-forming) and puts itself in order by itself (self-organizing). [2] The people who are in public relations do things for the "public". People who are needed to make a group's dreams come true are named as "target publics", and people that help the target publics are named as "influentials". Influentials are important, because they give answers to the target public's problems. The "target publics" are also important, because their answers to the government problems (like electoral votes) are very important. [7]
The public also has rules of being in the public ("social norms"), that play a major role in how information is moved.
Public relations theory shows that the meaning of publics is situational, according to John Dewey and James E. Gruning, and is simply a group of people. According to Gabriel M. Vasquez, a public has people that all know about their common problem and all try to solve that problem (“homo narrans” [Latin for "storytelling human"]), and create a list of problems to be solved (agenda-building). [8] For example, Schools are commonly talked about for their agenda-building, on whether they should teach about religion or not (secular). [9] Some people think publics are about the government (political) and last forever.
But, other people think that the meaning of public is non-situational. Kirk Hallahan, professor at Colorado State University , thinks that the meaning of public is about another organization, and has public as that it is people who are about (relate) to an organization, who show different amounts of activity—passivity (getting information without giving it), and who might (or might not) talk with others about their relationship with the group. [ source? ]
Social publics are people who like the same ideas or hobbies.
Networked publics are social publics who are organized by the new technology. Because of this, networked publics are the result of technologies that connect people (networked technologies, like social media), and the whole result from a combination of the people in the networked public, their technologies, and their ideas. [10]
The situational theory of publics, is about the idea that publics can be used and organized by how much they know (are aware of) their common problem , and how much action the group has taken to resolve that problem.  This theory shows when people communicate ideas and when the ideas are about the people who are important in solving the common problem.  This theory is almost the same as John Dewey's theory of publics and Blumer's theory of publics.
The five key concepts in this theory are:
This theory comes from James E. Grunig's writing, "The Role of Information in Economic Decision Making" in 1966. This writing was the beginning of the situational theory of publics, as it had the first key idea, problem recognition, in the writing. Then, when he wrote about the decisions of people who own land in Columbia to become a professor, he also wrote about the second key idea, constraint recognition. He then added Herbert Krugman's idea of the third key idea, level of involvement, to explain the difference between the fourth and fifth key ideas, information seeking and information processing. After that, he wrote a book in 1984 which was named "Managing Public Relations", which further made the situational theory of publics make more sense, based on John Dewey's book, which was named "The Public and Its Problems".
People who use the theory created equations which used the theory to organize the different types of publics, and the most real effects of communication for each public. Because these math rules were created, it made the theory more understandable and became used in a more common way in learning the theory (academic studies) and in some professional learning. This theory is like the learning of the actions of people buy things (consumer behavior), health communication, how media works (media exposure), and the communication of government related ideas (political communication), which are common in other parts of the learning of communication (communication research). But, this theory has more common key ideas and a more developed system of learning and analysis because of the equations. Because of this, it can become more common (popular) and include other smaller less common theories inside it (subsume).
Even though the theory is well developed, it develops even more common. The theory has been used to show why people join groups who really want things to happen (activist groups), to organize the external (real, actual) and internal (perceived) parts (dimensions) of problem recognition, and to learn whether information that is used in information processing (processed information) can create publics. Also, some more research was done on the internal and external dimensions of problem recognition, constraint recognition, and level of involvement (Grunig & Hon, 1988; Grunig, 1997). The research is about whether the ideas are internal or external. The research shows that if the concepts are internal, they can be changed by communication, and that if they are external, then the holdable things that are around the person need to be changed in order for the person's concept of the variables to change (Grunig, 1997, p. 25). But, there is a small amount of research on the internal and external dimensions of the three key concepts, so there can be more studies on these concepts (Grunig, 1997). Then, in 2011, Jeong-Nam Kim and Grunig extended the theory to the situational theory of problem solving .
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong
Hong Kong ( / ˌ h ɒ ŋ ˈ k ɒ ŋ / ( listen ) ; Chinese : 香港 , Hong Kong Cantonese : [hœ́ːŋ.kɔ̌ːŋ] ( listen ) , literally "Fragrant Port"), officially The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of The People's Republic of China , is one of two Special Administrative Regions (SARs) of the People's Republic of China (the other is Macau ). It is one of the richest and most highly developed parts of China. Hong Kong grew quickly in the decades after World War II . It is now a famous world class financial center. Hong Kong was one of the last territories of the British Empire before China obtained it and granted it special status in 1997.
The population of Hong Kong is more than seven million. The economy has rapidly grown from a trading port to a very rich city. Hong Kong also has the world's largest number of skyscrapers.
Hong Kong is divided into 3 main parts:
Hong Kong was a British colony from 1842 to 1997 because China lost the Second Opium War . After the handover , Hong Kong became under Chinese control  but with a lot of autonomy.
Hong Kong has its own constitution that is different from that of the People's Republic of China (PRC).
Hong Kong is in a tropical area, and has monsoon winds. It is cool and wet in winter (Jan-Mar), hot and rainy from spring through summer (Apr-Sep), and warm, sunny and dry in the autumn (Oct-Dec). The rainy season is from May until September. In summer and early autumn, there is a frequent threat of typhoons .
As Hong Kong is located nearly at the centre of the Eurasian Plate , there are sometimes tsunamis and earthquakes.
The population of Hong Kong reached 7 million (7,496,98) in 2020. Most of the people in Hong Kong are Chinese . Hong Kong is one of the most densely populated countries in the world. It has an overall density of 6,300 people per square kilometre.
Hong Kong has one of the world’s lowest birth rates—1.11 per woman at an age of being capable to give birth as of 2012. This is far below the rate needed to replace each person, 2.1.
People from Hong Kong mainly speak Cantonese . Students are required to learn English at school. Ever since Hong Kong became a part of China , the number of people who speak Mandarin has increased because Mandarin is the official language of the PRC.
17 days of the year are public holidays in Hong Kong:
There are coins from 10 cents to 10 Hong Kong Dollars; and bank-notes (paper money bills) from $10 to $1000. One American dollar is equal to about $7.75 in Hong Kong Dollars, at the official bank exchange rate.
Hong Kong's education system is mostly based off the English system. Children are required to be in school from age 6 until completing secondary school (high school) at age 18.
Hong Kong has 11 Universities:

Thailand ( / ˈ t aɪ l æ n d / TY -land or / ˈ t aɪ l ə n d / TY -lənd ; [8] Thai : ประเทศไทย , RTGS : Prathet Thai), officially the Kingdom of Thailand ( Thai : ราชอาณาจักรไทย , RTGS : Ratcha Anachak Thai; IPA: [râːt.tɕʰā ʔāːnāːtɕàk tʰāj] ( listen ) ), is a country in Southeast Asia .  Its neighbours are Laos , Cambodia , Malaysia , and Myanmar . Its name was Siam until June 1939 [9] and between 1945 and May 11 1949 . The word Thai (ไทย) comes from the ethnic group in the center of Thailand.
Thailand is a constitutional monarchy . It has a King as a head of state , who is Vajiralongkorn at the moment.
Most people here (95%) follow the philosophy called Buddhism . Smaller number of people (4.4%), mostly to the south, follow Islam . Other religions in Thailand are Christianity , Hinduism , and Sikhism . Some Muslims in the south have begun fighting the government because they want to be more independent .
A Buddhist kingdom named Sukhothai was founded here in 1238 .
A century later, a bigger kingdom named Ayuthaya appeared south of Sukhothai. Later Sukhothai became a part of Ayuthaya. Ayuthaya existed for more than 400 years before its fall by the attack of a Burmese kingdom.
A soldier of Chinese origin then founded a new capital city at Thonburi , and became King Tāksin .
The current era, Rattanakosin, started on founding Bangkok as the capital city by King Rama I of Chakri Dynasty .
Before 1932 , Thailand was an absolute monarchy . On June 24 , 1932, a group of people did a coup and changed Thailand to a constitutional monarchy . It was not until 1973 that Thai people voted for a Prime Minister in an election . There were coups both before and after this year.
In 1951, there was a failed coup - the Manhattan Rebellion . [10] On September 19 , 2006 , the army did a coup d'état and took control from Thaksin Shinawatra 's government.
In May 2014, a new military coup d'état removed another government.
In October 2016 , Rama X become the new king.
Between 1932 and 2014, Thailand had 12 coup d'etats.
Thailand is made up of 76 provinces (จังหวัด, changwat), put into 5 groups. There are 2 specially governed districts: the capital Bangkok and Pattaya. The 76 provinces including Bangkok are as follows:
NOTE : In italics [1], that province is about the Greater Bangkok sub-region; in italics [2], that province is about the West sub-region.
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semen
Semen (pronounced SEE -men or SEE -mən ) is the fluid that comes out from the end of a man's penis when he has an orgasm (the height of sexual excitement) and ejaculates . It is usually a white or yellowish, sticky substance made up of sperm (male cells for sexual reproduction ) floating in a fluid called seminal plasma that has water and different chemicals in it. Normally, an ejaculation makes between 1.5 and 5 millilitres (up to one teaspoonful ) of semen.
Many cultures around the world once thought or still think that semen has special or even magical qualities. Showing semen in forms of popular culture such as art and movies has for a long time been taboo , that is, not generally accepted by society . However, since the late 20th century, artists and moviemakers have done so more often.
The English word semen comes from the Latin word sēmen , which means " seed ". [1] In fact, seed was an old-fashioned name for semen. [2] The Latin word sēmen itself came from another Latin word, serěre , which means "to plant (a plant into the ground) or to sow (seeds in the earth)". [1] It was once thought that semen was like a seed that grew into a baby after being "planted" inside a woman's body.
Another name for semen is ejaculate . Some slang words for semen are cream , cum , jism , jizz , jazz load , spooge , spunk , nut , or wad . [ original research? ]
Semen is the fluid that comes out from the end of a man's penis when he has an orgasm (the height of sexual excitement) and ejaculates . It is usually white, but may also be slightly grey or yellow. [3] If there is blood in the semen, it can look pink or reddish. This is a condition called hematospermia, and may be because of some blockage, inflammation , infection or injury to some part of the male sex organs , such as the urethra , epididymis , prostate or testicles . A doctor should be seen if the pink or reddish colour does not go away after a few days. [4]
Men ejaculate different amounts of semen. Normally, an ejaculation makes between 1.5 and 5 millilitres (up to one teaspoonful ) of semen. [5] More semen usually comes out if a man has not ejaculated for many days, or if he has been stimulated (made sexually excited) for a long time. Older men make less semen. If a man ejaculates an unusually small amount of semen, this is a medical condition called hypospermia .
After a man has ejaculated, semen first becomes slightly thick and sticky, and may feel a bit like jelly and clump together in globs. Scientists think that semen does this so that if the man has had sex with a woman and has ejaculated inside her vagina , the semen stays in her vagina for longer and does not leak out. Between five and 40 minutes after this, semen becomes more liquid and watery. This probably allows the sperm in the semen to move through the vagina and into the woman's uterus and Fallopian tubes to try and fertilize an ovum (egg cell). If semen is ejaculated outside the body, after becoming watery it eventually dries up. [3]
Semen is made up of sperm (male cells for sexual reproduction ) floating in a fluid called seminal plasma. Sperm, also called spermatozoa, are made by a man's testicles and mature (grow up) in the epididymis . The fluids in seminal plasma come from different glands in the man's body: the seminal vesicles , prostate and bulbourethral glands (also called the Cowper's glands). (Glands are special organs in the body that make chemicals .) The table below shows the substances that make up semen and the glands that produce them: [3]
Seminal plasma protects and provides food for sperm as they travel inside a woman's body. The inside of a woman'a vagina does not suit sperm cells as it is acidic . To protect the sperm from the acid, seminal plasma is alkaline . A woman's immune system also tries to kill organisms (living things) that are not part of her body. Seminal plasma has chemicals called prostaglandins in it to stop the woman's body from killing the sperm.
Semen that does not have any germs in it (see below ) is not harmful if it is swallowed, for example after a person has had oral sex with a man and the man ejaculates in that person's mouth.
Semen quality refers to how well the sperm in a man's semen can fertilize a woman's ova. The better a man's semen quality is, the better chances he has to make a woman pregnant. A 1992 World Health Organization book said that an ejaculation of normal human semen has: [6]
The number of sperm in an ejaculation of semen depends on many things. There may be more sperm if:
If there are an unusually low number of sperm in an ejaculation, this is called oligospermia. If there are no sperm at all, this is called azoospermia. A man with oligospermia or azoospermia is usually infertile , and cannot or finds it very hard to make a woman pregnant by having sex with her.
If the semen does not have infections, it is okay to swallow semen. A woman cannot get pregnant from swallowing semen in her mouth. It is okay if a man swallows his own semen. Two doctors say it is good if a woman swallows semen often. They say women get breast cancer less if they swallow semen. [7] The doctors don't know why. Other doctors must do more tests.
Studies seem to say that semen is an anti-depressant . This means that it causes women not to feel depressed or sad. The studies found that when men had sex with women without using condoms , and the men's semen was taken into the women's vaginas , the women had better moods and felt happier. Scientists do not yet know if the same thing happens when semen is swallowed after oral sex , but some of them think it may. [8]
If a man has a sexually transmitted infection or STI (an infection that is passed from one person to another by sex), the germs that cause the disease can appear in his semen. If the person that the man has sex with touches the semen, he or she can become infected by the germs and pick up the disease. HIV , chlamydia, gonorrhea , hepatitis B , herpes and syphillis are examples of STIs. One of the ways for a man to lower the chance of passing on an STI to his sexual partner is to wear a condom on his penis when having sex. Getting semen in the mouth can be bad if the penis or semen has infections .
If semen gets in the eye, the eye will hurt. Wash the eye with warm water. Wash the eye for a few minutes. Some doctors say to get tested for infections . [9]
Some scientists think that parts of semen, such as sperm and seminal plasma, can make another person's immune system weaker. Experiments show that when substances in a man's semen enter another person's body, that person's body makes antibodies . Antibodies are large Y-shaped proteins used by the body's immune system to stop foreign objects from harming the body. However, the antibodies made in response to substances in semen attack one of the body's own cells , called T lymphocytes . [10] This weakens the body's immune system.
In a very small number of cases, people have experienced allergic reactions when they touched semen. This is called human seminal plasma hypersensitivity. The symptoms (signs of the medical problem) can either be near the part of the body which touched the semen, or all over the body. They may include itching of the vagina, redness, swelling or blisters within 30 minutes of contact. They may also include itching and hives (large, red, itchy patches) all over the body, and even difficulty breathing. [11]
The best way to test for human seminal plasma hypersensitivity is for a man to use a condom when having sex. When a condom is used, after ejaculation the man's semen stays inside the condom and does not touch the body of the person he is having sex with. If the man's sexual partner usually has allergic symptoms to semen but does not have any when a condom is used, this may show that his partner's body is extra-sensitive to semen. A person can often get over a mild semen allergy by coming into contact with semen often. [12] If the allergic reaction is very bad, the person should see a doctor, especially if she is a woman trying to get pregnant. In such cases, it may be necessary for the woman to have a baby through artificial insemination. This is a medical way of fertilizing a woman's ova using a man's sperm without the man and the woman having sexual intercourse .
Many cultures around the world once thought or still think that semen has special or even magical qualities. Some examples are set out below:
Displaying semen in forms of popular culture such as art and movies has for a long time been taboo , that is, not generally accepted by society . However, since the late 20th century artists and moviemakers have done so more often.
The American photographer Andres Serrano sometimes takes photographs of body fluids and displays them as artworks. One example is Blood and Semen II (1990), which is a picture of blood and semen mixed together. Some people are shocked by such pictures and think it is wrong of him to make them, while others think that as an artist he is free to create such works. [19] Another of Serrano's pictures, Blood and Semen III , was featured on the cover of the 1996 music album Load by the American heavy metal band Metallica . [20]
The United Kingdom -based artists Gilbert Proesch and George Passmore, better known as Gilbert and George, have also used semen and other body fluids to create artworks. [21]
Apart from pornographic movies showing people having sex, semen is usually not shown in movies as many people think that doing so is obscene (not decent). However, some movies that have shown semen are the American comedy movies There's Something about Mary (1998), [22] American Pie (1999), [23] Scary Movie (2000) [24] and Scary Movie 2 (2001). [25] In the Spanish movie Y tu mamá también ( And Your Mother Too , 2001), there is a scene where two high-school boys who are friends lie on diving boards over a swimming pool and masturbate (make themselves sexually excited). Semen is later shown floating on the water. [26] Such movies are usually not thought to be suitable for children to watch.
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_intercourse
Sexual intercourse (or simply called sex ) is the insertion and thrusting of a male's penis into a female's vagina . [1] [2] People and animals that sexually reproduce use sexual intercourse to have an offspring . Sometimes sexual intercourse is called coitus or copulation and is more casually known as having sex or sleeping together . The two animals may be of opposite sexes or they may be hermaphroditic , as is the case with snails . [3] Sexual intercourse may also be between individuals of the same sex .
Humans sometimes engage in behaviors that do not include the penetration of sexual organs , such as oral intercourse or anal intercourse or by non-sexual organs ( fingering , fisting ). These behaviors are sometimes included in the definition of sexual intercourse. [2] Sex is usually teleiophilic (between adults). [4]
Two animals coming together for the purposes of sexual reproduction is called mating . Most mammals only mate when the female is at the point of estrus , which is the most fertile period of time in its reproductive cycle. [5] [6] In certain animals, sexual intercourse is not only used for reproduction, but has taken other functions as well. These animals include bonobos , [7] dolphins , [8] and chimpanzees which also have sexual intercourse even when the female is not in estrus, and to engage in sex acts with same-sex partners. [9] In most instances, humans have sex primarily for pleasure. [10] This behavior in the above mentioned animals is also presumed to be for pleasure, [11] which in turn strengthens social bonds.
Many governments have laws relating to sex. Forcing someone to have sex who does not want to, called rape , is a serious crime in many countries. There are other forms of sex that may also be against the law, such as incest , sex with minors , sex outside of a marriage , prostitution , homosexual sex , sex with animals , as well as others.
Sexual intercourse is the natural and most common way to make a baby . It involves a man and woman having sex without birth control until the man ejaculates , or releases, semen from his penis into the woman's vagina .  The semen, which has sperm in it (which is made in his testicles ), moves to the Fallopian tubes , and if it finds an ovum on its way, it will try to fertilize it. If this works, the now fertilized ovum sticks to the side of the uterus and the woman becomes pregnant . The fertilized ovum then develops into a human. Medically , it is called a pregnancy until birth .
Certain species of animals also have sex for other purposes than to bear offspring. These include Humans , bonobos , [7] chimpanzees and dolphins . [8] These species also are among those known to engage in homosexual behaviors. [9] In both humans and bonobos, the female has a relatively concealed ovulation .  Neither male or female partners commonly know whether she is fertile at any given moment. One reason for this may be that sex partners of these species form strong emotional bonds. The partners come together for more than just sexual intercourse. In the case of humans, long-term partnership is more important than immediate sexual reproduction. [10]
Humans, bonobos and dolphins show cooperative behaviour. In many cases, this behaviour has shown better results than what an individual can achieve alone.  In these animals, the use of sex has evolved beyond reproduction and has taken additional social functions. Sex reinforces intimate social bonds between individuals. Overall, such cooperation also benefits each member of the group in that they are better able to survive.
In humans, sexual intercourse seems to serve three types of purposes,which do not exclude one another:
In the late 20th century, very effective forms of contraception (birth control) were developed allowing a man and women to help prevent a baby from being made when they have sex. One type of contraception is a condom . This is a piece of rubber that covers the penis that a man can wear during intercourse, which stops the man's semen from going into the woman's vagina. This does not always work though because the condom may rip or tear. Another well-known type of contraception is called the Pill , which a woman takes every day. When a woman is "on the Pill," she and her partner may have sex any time they wish with very little chance of making a baby. It is recommended that a couple who have a sexual relationship use two forms of contraception. That way if one fails the other is a 'backup'. Contraception allows people to keep "sex for fun" separate from "sex to make children". For example, a fertile couple may use contraception to experience sexual pleasure (recreational). At the same time, this experience may strengthen their relationship, and a stronger relationship may mean that they will better be able to raise children in the future.
Who people like to have sex with depends on their sexuality . Men who like to have sex with women, and women who like to have sex with men are heterosexual or " straight ". Men who only like to have sex with other men, and women who only like to have sex with other women are homosexual or " gay ". A different word to describe a woman who only likes to have sex with other women is " lesbian ". Some people like both men and women, which is called being bisexual . Others do not feel sexual attraction at all, and are referred to as asexual .
Approximately 1.5% of the UK's population in 2010 was bisexual or gay. [13]
Some diseases can be caught by having sex. These diseases are called sexually-transmitted infections (STIs). [14]
Some examples of STIs include chlamydia infection , syphilis and gonorrhoea . A virus called HIV causes AIDS , which cannot be cured and can lead to death.
Using Latex condoms or oral dams reduce the chance that a few types of diseases will be passed on, but it not entirely effective for all STIs. Birth control (like " the Pill ") can prevent pregnancy, but won't prevent sexual infections.
Some STIs can also be spread in ways other than having sex. For example, herpes simplex and hepatitis B could be caught by a virgin without having sex, but can also be caught through sex. Some types of STIs can spread from contact between the genitals, mouth, anus, skin, eyes, and (rarely) infected surfaces; this depends a lot on the type of STI and how it spreads. Some common diseases like HPV can cause warts and cancer in the genitals or anus or throat .
There exists an HPV vaccine that prevents some sexually-transmitted strains of HPV; however, the vaccine only works if you get vaccinated before becoming infected. The vaccine is approved of for both men and women, but is often not required in the U.S. due to politics .
There are many other kinds of sex. Two of them are oral sex and anal sex .
Oral sex is when one partner uses the tongue, mouth, or throat to excite the other partner's sex organs.
Slangs for oral sex is common in Western cultures, for example: "going down on", "giving a blowjob ", "giving head", or "eating out".  The technical term for oral sex is fellatio if performed on a male and cunnilingus if performed on a female. When a man performs fellatio on himself, it is called autofellatio , and autocunnilingus if a woman performs cunnilingus on herself. Few men and women are able to do this.
People can get sexually transmitted infections from oral sex, such as herpes (which can be passed between the mouth and groin), HIV and even oral cancer.
Anal sex is when an erect penis or other device made for sexual pleasure is inserted into the sexual partner's anus . Anal sex with a female does not lead to pregnancy by itself, however, semen can leak out of the anus and enter into the vagina, and pregnancy may rarely occur. Anal sex can still pass sexually transmitted diseases from one partner to another. It can also be very unhealthy for the body because the skin around the anus can tear, bleed and get infected with bacteria. [15] For safety and pleasure partners often use condoms, female condoms and/or lubrication .
A painful sexual act is a condition of repeated or persistent genital pain before, during, or after sexual intercourse due to physical, psychogenic and emotional causes. Doctors call the condition as "dyspareunia". It occurs in women and men. The condition affects up to one-fifth of women at some point in their lives. [16]
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_testing
COVID-19 testing can help find the SARS-CoV-2 virus. There are two types of test; one can find the virus (i.e. Polymerase chain reaction , also called PCR) and the other that can find antibodies produced in response to infection .
An accurate mortality rate of the disease and the level of herd immunity in the population can be found from the results of these tests. However, it is still not known how long immunity will last, and how effective it will be. [1]
Due to limited testing, as of March 2020, no countries had reliable data of the virus. [2]

As of 7 April 2020, the WHO had accepted two diagnostic tests under the Emergency Use Listing procedure (EUL) for use during the COVID‑19 pandemic. [11] Both in vitro diagnostics, the tests are genesig Real-Time PCR Coronavirus (COVID‑19) created by Primerdesign , and cobas SARS-CoV-2 Qualitative assay for use on the cobas® 6800/8800 Systems by Roche Molecular Systems . Approval means that these tests can also be given away by the United Nations .
In March 2020 China [12] reported problems with accuracy in their test kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDC had "flaws". [13]
80% of test kits the Czech Republic purchased from China gave wrong results. [14] [15]
A group of scientists from Hokkaido University developed an antibody test that could detect avian flu antibodies in only 20 minutes.  They said their test could be changed to detect SARS-CoV-2. [16] [17]
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_flu
Bird flu (also called avian influenza , avian flu , bird influenza , or grippe of the birds ), is an illness caused by a virus . The virus, called influenza A or type A , usually lives in birds , but sometimes infects mammals , including humans . It is called influenza when it infects humans.
There are many types of influenza A, which was first found in a bird in Italy in 1878. Most types have weak symptoms , such as breathing problems, similar to the common cold .
But some types kill birds, and a few kill humans and other mammals. One type of bird flu, called Spanish flu , killed 50 to 100 million people [1] in 1918/1920. Another type, called Asian Flu killed one million in 1957, and another one, called Hong Kong Flu , also killed one million people in 1968.
A subtype, called H5N1 , killed six people in Hong Kong in 1997, but did not kill again until 2003, this time in China . Until the middle of 2005, it was primarily found in southeast Asia but since then has spread to parts of Africa and Europe . It has killed tens of millions of birds and resulted in the slaughter of hundreds of millions of other birds to limit its spread. So far it is mostly a bird disease and rarely infects humans. The concern about H5N1 is that it is constantly evolving at a very fast rate and could create a human flu pandemic that could kill many millions of people. Governments around the world are spending billions of dollars to deal with this problem: studying H5N1, creating vaccines, conducting pandemic practice exercises, stockpiling useful flu medication, and many other important activities.

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine
A vaccine is medicine given by a doctor or nurse and makes a person less likely to get a disease or virus . It gives immunity to an infectious disease caused by a particular germ ( bacteria or virus ). For example, the flu vaccine makes it less likely that a person will get the flu. A flu vaccine is often called a flu shot .
Vaccines are usually made from something that is alive , or was alive.
The word "vaccine" comes from the Latin words vaccīn-us (from the word vacca , meaning " cow ").  In 1796, Edward Jenner used cows infected with cowpox ( variolae vaccinae ) to protect people against smallpox . [1] The use of vaccines is called vaccination .
Scientist Edward Jenner created the first vaccine in the 1770s. At this time, smallpox was a deadly disease. Jenner noticed that people who had already had cowpox (a disease that is related to smallpox) usually did not get smallpox . He thought that getting cowpox protected people against smallpox.
To test this idea, Jenner gave a boy cowpox . Then he infected the boy with smallpox. The boy did not get sick because he had already had cowpox. Jenner was right: having cowpox protected people against smallpox.
Because cowpox protection made fewer people sick than smallpox protection, England made smallpox protection illegal in 1840. In 1853, they made another law that said every child had to be vaccinated against smallpox using Jenifer vaccine.
In the 19th century, Louis Pasteur made a rabies vaccine.
In the 20th century, scientists created vaccines to protect people against diphtheria , measles , mumps , and rubella . In the 1950s, Jonas Salk created the polio vaccine .
However, vaccines still do not exist for many important diseases, like malaria and HIV . [1]
Many countries have passed compulsory vaccination laws - laws that require certain people to get vaccinated. [1] For example, in many countries, children have to be vaccinated against certain diseases in order to go to public school .
There are many different types of vaccines. [2]
One common type of vaccine is a "live vaccine."  This type of vaccine contains a small amount of a live virus or bacteria.  Before the vaccine is given, scientists weaken the virus or bacteria so it cannot make a person sick.  When a person gets a live vaccine, their immune system learns to recognize and fight off that virus or bacteria.  Then, if the person is exposed to the virus or bacteria in the future, their immune system will already "know" how to fight it off.  Examples of live vaccines include vaccines for measles, mumps, and chickenpox .
Another common type of vaccine is an "inactivated vaccine."  These vaccines contain dead viruses or bacteria.  These do not cause the immune system to react as strongly as live vaccines.  Because of this, people may need "booster shots" - extra doses of the vaccine, given at certain times, so their immune system can "learn" how to fight off the infection.  Examples of inactivated vaccines include vaccines for pertussis (whooping cough), rabies , and hepatitis B .
In other vaccines, only a protein molecule from the virus or bacterium is injected into the patient.  The protein is enough for the patient's immune system to recognize the whole germ.
With messenger RNA vaccines , only the messenger RNA (mRNA), which acts as a blueprint or recipe for the protein, is injected into the patient.  The first mRNA vaccines were made in the 1990s, but scientists did not make large numbers of them until the 2010s.  Some mRNA vaccines work against cancer and can make tumors smaller. [3] [4]
Scientists can make some types of vaccines in a laboratory .
Vaccines do not guarantee complete protection from a disease. [5] In other words, a person can get a disease that they were vaccinated against.
Sometimes, this happens because the person's immune system did not respond to the vaccine (it did not "learn" how to fight off the disease after the person got the vaccine). This may happen because the person's immune system is already weak (for example, because of diabetes , HIV infection , old age, or steroid use). It may also happen because the person's immune system cannot make the particular B cells which make the antibodies that stick to the pathogen.
Some vaccines work better than others at protecting people from diseases.  There are many reasons for this:
Since vaccines first existed, there have been people who did not agree with the idea of using vaccines. [8] Around the world, most scientists and doctors agree that the benefits of using vaccines are much greater than the risks.  The adverse effects from vaccines are rare.  Not vaccinating people is a much greater risk, because vaccines prevent suffering and death from infectious diseases . [9] [10]
There have been controversies over using vaccines such as whether vaccines are safe, the amount of research and whether it is morally right to force people to get vaccinated.
Some religious groups do not allow uses of vaccines. [10] [11]
Some political groups argue that people should be able to choose whether or not to get vaccinated.  They argue that laws requiring people to get vaccinated violate individual rights . [8] In response, one study says: "Vaccine refusal not only increases the individual risk of disease but also increases the risk for the whole community". [12]
Some parents choose not to follow the regular vaccine schedule for their children.  One study looked at parents of children ages six months to six years old.  It found that 13% of these parents reported following an alternative vaccination schedule.  However, of these parents, less than 1 out of every 5 reported refusing all vaccines.  Most refused only certain vaccines, and/or delayed some vaccines until the child was older.
Parents who delay vaccines until their children are older are often concerned about their child's immune system being too young and weak to handle getting many vaccines at once.
One challenge in developing vaccines is economic . The diseases that most need vaccines today - HIV , malaria , and tuberculosis - exist mostly in poor countries . Companies that make vaccines would not make much money because many of the people who need them are too poor to pay for them.  There would also be financial and other risks to these companies if they tried making new vaccines for these diseases. [13]
Throughout history, most vaccines have been developed by governments , universities , and non-profit organizations . [14] Many vaccines have been highly cost-effective and good for public health . [13] In recent decades, the number of vaccines given throughout the world has increased dramatically. This increase, particularly in the number of different vaccines given to children before they start school, [15] may be due to laws and support from governments.
Another obstacle to making new vaccines is that when a new vaccine is made, the maker often files a patent on their vaccine.  These patents can keep the process used to make the vaccine secret.  That can make it harder to make other vaccines using the same process. [16]
Vaccines often contain other things besides the active vaccine (the weakened or dead virus or bacteria).  For example, vaccines may contain: [17]
Preservatives in vaccines, such as thiomersal , phenoxyethanol , and formaldehyde , prevent serious adverse effects. Thiomersal is more effective against bacteria, lasts longer in storage, and makes the vaccine stronger, safer, and more stable (less likely to be changed by things like heat).  However, in the United States, the European Union , and a few other developed countries , it is no longer used as a preservative in childhood vaccines because it contains mercury. [18] Some people have argued that thimerosal contributes to autism .  However, no convincing scientific evidence says this is true. [19]
If no preservative is added to a vaccine, harmful bacteria may grow in the vaccine.  For example, in 1928, Staphylococcus bacteria grew in a diphtheria vaccine that had no preservative in it.  Of 21 children who got that vaccine, 12 died. [20]
Animals are vaccinated to keep them from getting diseases, and to keep them from infecting humans with diseases. [21] Pets as well as livestock are routinely vaccinated.
In some instances, populations of wild animals may be vaccinated.  Sometimes, wild animals are vaccinated by spreading vaccine-laced food in a disease-prone area.  This method has been used to try to control rabies in raccoons . Where rabies occurs, laws may require dogs to get rabies vaccinations.
Dogs can also be vaccinated against many other diseases, including canine distemper , canine parvovirus , infectious canine hepatitis , adenovirus-2 , leptospirosis , bordatella , canine parainfluenza virus , and Lyme disease .
Scientists are also working on vaccines against many noninfectious human diseases, such as cancers and autoimmune disorders. [25] For example, the experimental vaccine CYT006-AngQb has been investigated as a possible treatment for high blood pressure . [26]
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_vaccine
A COVID-19 vaccine is any of the vaccines used against the Coronavirus Disease 2019 ( COVID-19 pandemic ). In July 2020, more than 150 vaccines were being developed in different laboratories. [1] Two mRNA vaccines , one by Pfizer and one by Moderna , were approved late in 2020. Both are over 90% effective. [2] A few vaccines also went into use in early 2021.
Several countries plan to give the vaccine to many people, but their plans are different. The United Kingdom plans to use its National Health Service .  Canada plans to use its military. The United States plans to send vaccine to all fifty states and then let the state governments each make their own system. [3]
The United Kingdom approved the Pfizer vaccine before the European Union or United States did. They began giving it to people on December 8. [4] The United States began giving people the vaccine on December 14, starting with health care workers in New York City . [5] By April 2021, several vaccines were in use around the world and hundreds of millions of people had been vaccinated.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect a vaccine against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative virus, to become available in less than 18 months. [6] The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) – which is organizing a US$2 billion worldwide fund for fast investment and creation of vaccine candidates [7] – indicated in April that a vaccine may be available under emergency use protocols in less than 12 months or by early 2021. [8] On 4 May 2020, the WHO organized a telethon (fundraising event broadcasted via televisions) to raise US$8 billion from forty countries to support rapid development of vaccines to prevent COVID-19 infections and deaths. [9] The United States government started Operation Warp Speed to develop a vaccine by January 2021. [1]
PittCoVacc is a vaccine invented by scientists from the University of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania in the United States . [10] It was invented to protect people from SARS-CoV-2 , the virus that causes COVID-19 . It was the first vaccine candidate, meaning vaccine that scientists thought would work well, published in a peer-reviewed study, meaning a scientific paper that other vaccine experts had read and approved before it was printed for people to read. [11] [12]
As of April 2020, it has been tested in mice but not in human beings. [10] [11] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19]
PittCoVacc is short for "Pittsburgh coronavirus vaccine." [10]
One of the head scientists, Dr. Andrea Gambotto, said they made the vaccine so quickly because they had worked on other coronaviruses before: "We had previous experience on SARS-CoV in 2003 and MERS-CoV in 2014. These two viruses, which are closely related to SARS-CoV-2, teach us that a particular protein, called a spike protein, is important for inducing immunity against the virus. We knew exactly where to fight this new virus.  That's why it's important to fund vaccine research. You never know where the next pandemic will come from."
The researchers used laboratory equipment to make pieces of the same proteins that are in SARS-CoV-2. They put the proteins inside the bodies of laboratory mice using a microneedle array , meaning a small patch with about 400 tiny needles made out of other protein and sugar. One of the scientists, Dr. Emrullah Korkmaz, said these needles melt away inside the skin after they release the vaccine.  The skin is a good place to put a vaccine because it has many immune cells in it. Then the mice made antibodies, or protective molecules, in their blood. The scientists measured the amount of antibodies and guessed it would be enough to fight off the SARS-CoV-2 virus if the mice were exposed to it.  It took about two weeks for the mice to make lots of antibodies. [10]
The scientists said it would be easy to make large amounts of vaccine and large numbers of microneedle arrays to use on people.
Another team of scientists led by Dr. Josef Penninger of the University of British Columbia invented a medicine called  APN01. They tested APN01 in engineered human tissue. This is human cells put together to act like part of the body, but it is not a whole animal or person. They added a protein called "human recombinant soluble angiotensin converting  enzyme 2" (hrsACE2) and saw that it stopped the virus from taking over cells.  They named their hrsACE2 APN01. [20] [21]
Other scientists have developed vaccines that use messenger RNA to teach the body to recognize the virus.  They say mRNA vaccines take less time to develop and make, than protein or whole-virus vaccines. [22] [23]
Messenger RNA vaccine s need to be stored at very cold temperatures.  Ordinary refrigerators are not cold enough. [24]
In mid-May 2020, a company called Moderna said they tested their mRNA vaccine in forty-five people and eight of them produced antibodies [25] but they did not publish the specific data or publish an article in a scientific journal. [26] Anna Durbin of Johns Hopkins University said it was too soon to tell if people would keep the antibodies long enough for the vaccine to work. [27] The United States Food and Drug Administration gave Moderna permission to test the vaccine again in more people. Moderna's chief medical officer said the vaccine could be ready in January 2021. [25]
The Moderna vaccine entered stage-three clinical trials on June 27, 2020.  That means it is being tested on humans.  Dr. Anthony Fauci said he did not think the vaccine would be dangerous. [28]
On November 16, Moderna said its vaccine was 94.5% effective.  The vaccine has to kept colder than freezing but it does not have to be kept as cold as the Pfizer vaccine. [2] Distribution began in February 2021. [29]
The German company BioNTech and Pfizer made a deal with the United States government to make 100 million doses of mRNA vaccine by December 2020.  The vaccine completed phase I trials and started its next trial on July 27, 2020.  Instead of being a phase II trial or a phase III trial, Pfizer's team is trying to do both phases at once.  If the companies can make the vaccine on time, the U.S. government will give them almost US$2 billion.  The vaccine is called BNT162b2. [1] BioNTech paid its employees overtime to do extra work.  They called this "Project Lightspeed" because they wanted to develop the vaccine quickly. [24] [30]
Because they wanted people to trust the virus Pfizer published the study protocols publicly.  That means they told everyone exactly how they were testing the virus.  This is information that companies usually keep secret so no one can steal their work. [24]
On November 9, 2020, Pfizer announced that BNT162 was 90% effective at preventing people from catching COVID-19.  They asked the FDA to approve the vaccine for emergency use.  The company had not yet published the results of the study in a formal scientific paper, so the FDA said they needed time to look at the results for themselves. [24]
The adenovirus is the virus that causes the common cold. [1] It does not harm the human body much.  Scientists have used the adenovirus in vaccines for many years against many diseases.  Scientists take pieces of dangerous viruses and attach them to adenovirus.  Then they inject the adenovirus into a human body.  The human immune system learns to recognize the pieces of dangerous viruses.  Then it can fight off the real dangerous viruses if the human is ever exposed to them.
In late April 2020, a team from the University of Oxford said that they had developed a COVID-19 vaccine.  The United States National Institutes of Health tested it in rhesus monkeys , and it worked.  Because they had already been working on a vaccine against a different coronavirus, they had a head start working on one for SARS-CoV-2. They would try to test their vaccine on 6000 people by the end of May 2020, and that their vaccine could be ready for people to use in September 2020. [31] [32]
The team took the spike protein from SARS-CoV-2 and put it on an adenovirus.  Then they injected that virus into test patients.  The idea is that the patients' immune systems will learn to attack the spike protein no matter what virus it is on.  This vaccine completed phase I trials and as of July 2020 is entering phase III trials.  The vaccine is called ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. [1]
The Chinese company CanSino Biologics is making a viral vector vaccine.  This vaccine uses an adenovirus that has the spike protein from SARS-CoV-2 on it.  Then the immune system learns to recognize the spike protein.  As of July 2020, this vaccine is in phase II trials, but the Chinese government gave CanSino Biologics permission to give it to people anyway.  They are allowed to give it to people in the Chinese military. [1]
The Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine is made from the Johnson & Johnson company. Unlike many vaccines, it doesn't need special, unusual refrigeration.
The company Sinovac in China and Bututan research center in Brazil worked together.  This is an inactivated virus vaccine .  This means the team took SARS-CoV-2 and changed it to make it harmless.  The patient's body learns to recognize the harmless virus and then it can recognize the harmful, wild virus too.  The company got permission to start phase III trials on July 3.  This virus is called CoronaVac. [1]
The company Sinopharm belongs to the government of China.  It is an inactivated virus vaccine. [33] This vaccine started phase III trials in the middle of July 2020. This vaccine does not have a name. [1]
The University of Melbourne and Murdoch Children's Research Institute are studying a vaccine that works against tuberculosis , the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccine.  It is a live-bacterium vaccine.  That means weak but not dead Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria are injected into the patient.  Then their immune system learns to fight it.  Over the years, scientists saw that the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccine did not only protect people from tuberculosis.  It protected them from other diseases too.  The scientists at the Murdoch Children's Research Institute and University of Melbourne are studying the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccine to see if it will protect people from COVID-19.  Because this vaccine has already been used for other diseases for more than one hundred years, doctors already knew it was safe to use.  As of July 2020, this vaccine is in phase III trials to see if it works on COVID-19. [1]
Scientists believe a vaccine that doctors spray into the patient's nose would work better than a vaccine injected into the patient's veins.  After a nasal vaccine, the body's immune cells look for the virus in the nose and mouth.  The nose and mouth are where most people are infected with SARS-CoV-2.  Scientists are not sure why this works.  As of July 2020, teams in the Netherlands, the United States, and Canada are making nasal vaccines. [34]
As of January 27th, Israel is currently the leader in percentage of people vaccinated, followed by the USA and then the United Kingdom. Israel has reportedly vaccinated about 20% of it's population, or 2 million people. [35]

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_British_Columbia
The University of British Columbia ( UBC ) is a major public university located in Vancouver , British Columbia , Canada , with another location in Kelowna .  It was started in 1908 and moved to its current location in Point Grey in 1925.  It is one of the largest universities in Canada, with a student population of over 60,000. UBC has a 1,000-acre campus, a part of which has been set aside for an endowment fund which generates $1.6 billion for the university. [2]
The Vancouver location is in the University Endowment Lands, about 10 km (6 mi) west of Downtown Vancouver. [3] UBC is home to TRIUMF, Canada's national workplace for particle and nuclear physics . It has the world's largest cyclotron . UBC also has the Peter Wall Institute for Advanced Studies and Stuart Blusson Quantum Matter Institute. UBC and the Max Planck Society founded the first Max Planck Institute in North America, which studies quantum materials. [4] The UBC Library system has over 9.9 million books in its 21 locations and is one of the largest research libraries in Canada. [5] [6] The Okanagan campus, added in 2005, is located in Kelowna, British Columbia.
Three Canadian prime ministers, including Canada's first female prime minister Kim Campbell and current prime minister Justin Trudeau , went to UBC. [7]


https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand_washing
Hand washing is the process of cleaning hands with water and soap or other special liquids. It is done to take off dirt, germs , and poisons .  Germs and poisons cause diseases and other health problems.  Germs are bacteria , viruses , or fungi .  Some diseases are not stopped by antibiotic drugs. Hand washing prevents lots of new diseases. Not washing hands before cooking or touching food is risky .
Always wash hands:
Use soap and warm (running, if available) water. Wet hands and add soap. Rub wet hands strongly with soap outside running water more than 10 seconds. Rub all parts of the hands again and again. Clean all dirt under fingernails. Then rub hands under running water again and again to take off all soap. Dry hands using a clean cloth or paper. Use moisturizing lotion so hands do not dry if the hands are being washed many times every day.
For a medical worker, doctor, or nurse, not washing hands before touching every new person is dangerous. Use more than enough soap and water and rub each part of the hands again and again. Rub between each finger. Use a brush and clean under fingernails. Use more water to take off the soap and dry hands paper towel.
To scrub the hands for a surgery , water that can  be turned on and off without touching with the hands is needed, a cleaning liquid named "chlorhexidine" or "iodine wash", sterile cloth for drying the hands after washing, a sterile brush for hard washing and another sterile instrument for cleaning under the fingernails. Take off all watches, rings, and other jewels from the hands before washing. Wash the hands  and arms to the elbows again and again. Be strong and serious about the washing.  Use running water again and again to take off all soap. Keep hands up so water does not go from arms to hands. Dry the hands with the sterile cloth and put on surgical shirt or dress. Sterile means nothing on it that could cause a disease.
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic
A pandemic (from Greek παν pan all + δήμος demos people) is an epidemic (an outbreak of an infectious disease ) that spreads across a large region (for example a continent), or even worldwide.
According to the World Health Organization , a pandemic can start when three conditions have been met:
A disease or condition is not a pandemic merely because it is widespread or kills many people; it must also be infectious. For example cancer is responsible for many deaths but is not considered a pandemic because the disease is not infectious (although certain causes of some types of cancer might be).
The World Health Organization (WHO) has developed a plan to prepare globally the fight against influenza . It defines the stages of a pandemic and makes recommendations for national measures before and during a pandemic. The phases are:
Interpandemic period:
Pandemic alert period:

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_University
The University of Oxford is a university in Oxford , England . It is the oldest university in the English-speaking world. The Times Higher Education World University Rankings said it is the best university in the world.
The university is 38 colleges and six private halls.  All of these colleges have their own buildings and their own staff. Oxford is quite different from most modern universities where all the students live on a campus . Oxford does not have a campus, although it does have some central places where students from different colleges can come together (for example, libraries).
The Bodleian Library (founded in 1602) is the main library of the University of Oxford, and one of the oldest libraries in Europe. It is the second largest library in the United Kingdom after the British Library .
Oxford is the world's third-oldest university after the University of Bologna , and the world's second-oldest surviving university. [10]
There is no known date of foundation, but there is evidence of teaching as far back as 1096. [2] It grew rapidly from 1167 when Henry II banned English students from attending the University of Paris . [2] English students were not allowed to continue studying in Paris after Thomas Becket was murdered.
There were fights between the students in Oxford and the people who lived there in the early 13th century. Some students and teachers left the university in 1209, and made a new university in Cambridge .  These two universities are now great rivals, and together are sometimes known as " Oxbridge ".
Until 1920, women were not allowed to take degrees at Oxford, although some women studied at Oxford before that time. Nowadays, all the colleges allow both men and women as students, and the number of male and female students is roughly equal.
One of the most famous teachers at the university was Lewis Carroll , author of Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass , stories for children.
There are 38 colleges at Oxford and 6 permanent private halls.
A college will normally offer the students accommodation (a room to sleep and study in) for the first and last years of their time at University. Many also offer accommodation for other years. A college will also have space for teaching and socializing. When most of the older colleges started they were only for people of one sex, but St Hilda's College, the last college to allow only women to study there, recently allowed men as well.
A permanent private hall is slightly different to a college. They were normally started by religious groups to educate their members in philosophy and theology , but some have since grown and offer a broader range of subjects. Some halls are run by monks, and one of them – St Benet's Hall – will only accept male students.
Most colleges will teach at both undergraduate (the more basic first degree that a student takes) and postgraduate (a higher level of study) level. There are also some special colleges that are more restrictive. Five colleges only offer space to postgraduate students. Harris Manchester College is only for "mature students" (those who are over 21 when they start their degree). All Souls College does not take students – all of its members teach students or do research.
Oxford, like Cambridge , is very popular, but there are only a limited number of spaces for students. It is therefore harder for students to get into these universities. The colleges look for the students with the best school results in the subjects for which they are applying, typically A marks on A-levels .
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhesus_macaque
The rhesus macaque ( Macaca mulatta ), often called the rhesus monkey and Indian monkey , is one of the best known species of Old World monkeys.
It lives in a wide area, and has an unknown but quite large population. It lives in a broad range of habitats. Native to South , Central and Southeast Asia , troops of Macaca mulatta inhabit a great variety of habitats from grasslands to arid and forested areas, but also close to human settlements. [1]
Rhesus macaques are native to northern India , Bangladesh , Pakistan , Nepal , Burma , Thailand , Afghanistan , Vietnam , southern China , and some neighboring areas. They have the widest geographic ranges of any nonhuman primate. He is also known as national mammal of Pakistan.
They are regular swimmers. Babies as young as a few days old can swim, and adults are known to swim over a half mile between islands. Rhesus macaques are noted for their tendency to move from rural to urban areas, where they rely on handouts or refuse from humans. [2]
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA_vaccines
Messenger RNA vaccines or mRNA vaccines is a type of vaccine that protect the body from certain viruses .  Some mRNA vaccines help the body kill cancer . [1] [2] Like all vaccines , mRNA vaccines increase the body's immunity so the patient is less likely to catch an infectious disease .
Almost all cells make and use their own mRNA.  They use it to make proteins.  Each mRNA is like a blueprint or recipe for one kind of protein.
Most vaccines work by taking something from a harmful germ and putting it inside the patient's body without any parts of the germ that cause harm.  Then the patient's own cells learn to identify the germ using its other parts.  Then, if a living germ ever attacks the body, the patient's cells fight it off without having to learn what it is first.  Some vaccines do this by putting a dead, weak germ inside the patient's body.  Other vaccines do this by putting lots of proteins that the germ makes inside the body but not any germs themselves.  mRNA vaccines work by putting mRNA inside the body instead of protein.  Then the body uses the mRNA to make protein itself.
mRNA vaccines can be injected into the skin or muscle with a needle. [2] Some mRNA vaccines can be inhaled into the patient's nose.  Anti-cancer mRNA vaccines can be injected into the tumor.
Scientists think mRNA vaccines are safer than other vaccines because it is easy to make only the mRNA that makes the germ's proteins and easy to leave out the part of the mRNA that makes the harmful parts of the germ.  This way, the mRNA does not make whole germs inside the body.  Some proteins can be harmful to the body, but mRNA itself is not. [2]
The first mRNA vaccine was used in mice around 1990 but it was a long time before large numbers of scientists started to work making mRNA vaccines. [2]
The first mRNA vaccines used on people were made to work against cancer in the late 1990s.  Doctors found out which proteins only tumor cells make and used mRNA for those proteins as a vaccine so the patient's own immune systems would kill some of the tumor cells. [1] [2]

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland
– on the European continent ( green & dark grey ) – in the United Kingdom ( green )
Northern Ireland ( Irish : Tuaisceart Éireann , Ulster Scots : Norlin Airlann ) is a constituent country of the United Kingdom , which is on the island of Ireland .
The whole island of Ireland used to be a kingdom , called the Kingdom of Ireland but after the Act of Union in the year 1800, it became part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland . This stayed until 1922, after a civil war , when Ireland was divided into the Republic of Ireland , the sovereign state that takes up the southern part of the island, and Northern Ireland, which stayed as part of the UK .
About 1.8 million people live in Northern Ireland, which has the capital and largest city is Belfast . The historic administrative roles of its 6 counties have since 1972 been replaced by 26 unitary authorities Counties of Northern Ireland .
Sometimes people use other names for Northern Ireland. Some call it Ulster , even though some parts of Ulster are actually in the Republic of Ireland. Others call it "the North" or "the Six Counties", because they do not want to recognize that a part of the island of Ireland is not fully independent and the north of it is actually in the United Kingdom. Northern Ireland is the smallest part of the United Kingdom at 5,345 sq mi.
The only official flag in Northern Ireland is the Union Flag of the United Kingdom. The Ulster Banner, however, is still used as the flag of Northern Ireland by loyalists and unionists, and to represent Northern Ireland internationally in some sporting competitions.
English is spoken by almost everyone in Northern Ireland. Another important language is Irish (sometimes called "Irish Gaelic") and a language known as Ulster Scots , which comes from Eastern Ulster and Lowland Scotland. The Irish language became less widely spoken in the 20th century, but a revival has led to increased usage, especially in Belfast, the Glens of Antrim and counties Tyrone and Fermanagh. This revival has been driven largely through the creation of Irish-language schools. The Irish language is spoken by some nationalists (whether Catholic or Protestant ) people. Ulster Scots is almost exclusive to areas of North Antrim and the Ards Peninsula.
Some languages like Chinese , Urdu or Polish are becoming more common in Northern Ireland as people from other countries move to Northern Ireland.
Christianity is the largest religion in Northern Ireland, with over 80% of the population identifying themselves with a Christian denomination at the 2011 census. Almost 42% of these people identify as Protestant , 41% as Roman Catholic , and just over 17% as nothing or another religion. The largest Protestant churches are the Presbyterian Church in Ireland , the Church of Ireland and the Methodist Church in Ireland .
Since the Belfast Agreement (sometimes called the Good Friday Agreement) of Friday, 10 April 1998 , there has been mainly peace between the two communities in Northern Ireland, the Protestants and Catholics. This agreement was agreed by most of the people in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland , as well as the Irish and British governments. It allows for the self-government of Northern Ireland and greater North-South co-operation and co-operation between Britain and the Republic of Ireland. Additionally, it makes clear the right of the people of Northern Ireland to decide their constitutional future and select whether they are British citizens, Irish citizens or both.
The most popular sports in Northern Ireland are association football , gaelic football and rugby union . Athletics , boxing , cricket , golf , hockey , hurling , snooker and motor sports are also common. Most sports are organised on an all-Ireland basis, and in international competitions, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland compete together as Ireland (e.g. Ireland national rugby union team, Ireland national cricket team). The main exception is football.
Football in Northern Ireland is governed by the Irish Football Association (IFA). In international competitions Northern Ireland has its own team - the Northern Ireland national football team . The Northern Ireland team has qualified for three FIFA World Cups (in 1958 , 1982 and 1986 ). Perhaps the most famous player from Northern Ireland was George Best .
Track and field athletes from Northern Ireland can choose to compete either with athletes from Great Britain (as the team "Great Britain & Northern Ireland"), or with athletes from the rest of Ireland (as "Ireland").
Belfast is home to the Ulster Rugby team (which competes in the Pro 12 league and Heineken Cup ), and the Belfast Giants ice-hockey team.
Trains are run by NI Railways which run from Belfast to Portrush, Londonderry, Bangor, Larne, Portadown and Newry.  The Enterprise is run by both NI Railways and Irish Rail and links Belfast to Dublin.
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon
Interferons ( IFN s) are proteins released by body cells in response to pathogens such as viruses , bacteria , parasites or to tumor cells. They allow cells to trigger the defenses of the immune system .
IFNs belong to the large class of glycoproteins known as cytokines .  Interferons are named after their ability to "interfere" with virus replication inside host cells.
IFNs also have other functions:
About ten distinct IFNs have been identified in mammals ; seven of these have been described for humans. All IFNs are very important for fighting viral infections.

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo
A placebo is a treatment for a disease or condition which is deliberately ineffective. The motive usually is that if a person believes that a medicine, diet , or other treatment is good for himself or herself, then it is good for the person.
Sometimes sick people who receive a placebo feel like they are getting better, and sometimes their bodies actually do get better. When patients have that response, it is called the "placebo effect". The term placebo effect (or placebo response ) was introduced in 1920. It is the response of the subject which causes the observed effect, not the substance,.
John Haygarth tested a placebo effect in the 18th century. [1] It showed " to a degree which has never been suspected, what powerful influence upon diseases is produced by mere imagination ". [2]
Émile Coué , a French apothecary , working  between 1882 and 1910, discovered what later came to be known as the "Placebo effect". He reassured his clients by praising each remedy's efficiency and leaving a small positive notice with each medication. In 1901 Coué began to study under hypnosis. In 1913, Coué and his wife founded La Société Lorraine de Psychologie appliquée . [3] His book Self-mastery through conscious autosuggestion was published in England (1920) and in the United States (1922).
Placebos are used as part of blind trials. Blind trials work like this: Some people are given the medicine or treatment being tested, and others are given the placebo. No one knows who gets the real treatment and who gets the placebo. They are "blind" to their treatment.
If researchers notice that the "treatment group" is different from the "placebo group" they will know that the difference is because of the treatment. Without a "placebo group" then researchers cannot know if those changes would have happened anyway, no matter which medicine people had taken.
Placebos can have real effects on patients: that is what "placebo effect" means. Since a landmark paper in 1955 the placebo effect has been recognised and accepted by some, [4] and denied by others. [5] However, there is no doubt that for certain conditions, the placebo effect does exist. Examples are:
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria
Malaria is an infectious disease caused by a parasite : it is spread by the bite of an infected mosquito . People catch malaria when the parasite enters the blood . The parasite causes a deadly infection which kills many people each year (from 75 million cases in 1950s to 0.1 million cases in 1960s). However, due to the development of insecticide resistance among mosquitoes and other factors, it staged a comeback in the mid 1970s (6.47 million cases in 1976), and continues to prevail in endemic/subendemic proportions, so that 80% indian population lives in malaria risk areas.
Malaria is produced by 4 species of the protozoal parasite Plasmodium, is endemic in many tropical countries. It is one of the most common health problems . As per latest WHO estimates (2011)* between 149–274 (median 216) million clinical cases and ~ 0.655 million deaths occur globally due to malaria each year, 90% of which are in Africa. This amounts to one malaria death every minute. In India, the National Malaria Eradication Programme (NMEP), started in 1958, achieved near complete disappearance of the disease in 1960s (from 75 million cases in 1950s to 0.1 million cases in 1960s).
The parasite that causes malaria is a protozoan called ' Plasmodium' . Protozoa are organisms with only one cell , but they are not bacteria . Bacteria are smaller and simpler than protozoans.
People usually get malaria from the Anopheles or Culex mosquitoes Archived 2019-02-28 at the Wayback Machine : they are the vectors of the disease. The Plasmodium gets into people by the bites of mosquitoes. The Plasmodium is in the mosquito's special saliva. [1] The mosquito's saliva injects an anticoagulant into the person to prevent their blood from clotting. The person is then infected with Plasmodium as a by-product. This makes the person have the disease we call malaria.
Only the female mosquito gives people malaria, because only the female mosquito consumes blood. The male mosquito lives on the nectar of flowers. The female uses blood as a source of protein for its eggs.
Some people do not get malaria from mosquitoes. A baby can get it while inside its mother. This is called maternal-foetal transmission . People can also get malaria from a blood transfusion . This is when someone gives blood to another person. Another way people can catch malaria is by using a needle that someone with the disease used before them.
The red blood cells are infected next, at this stage symptoms of malaria appear.

There are several species (kinds) of Plasmodium that cause malaria in humans:
P. vivax and P. falciparum cause the most malaria in people. Falciparum malaria is the worst kind, and kills the most people.
When Plasmodium enters the blood, they are then called sporozoites . Sporozoites go to the liver , where they make many more sporozoites. Then they change into a different form of Plasmodium . This form is the merozoite . The merozoites go into the red blood cells , then they make many more merozoites.
The merozoites break out of the red blood cells again and again. When they do this, the person gets very sick, and shows symptoms of malaria. This happens every few days, and is called a paroxysm.
P. vivax and P. ovale can live in the liver for a long time. A person can look well, but still have the Plasmodium in the liver. This is called a dormant phase . Weeks or months later, the Plasmodium can leave the liver to the blood, and the person will get sick again.
P. falciparum is the most dangerous type of malaria. It makes people sicker than those with other types of malaria, because there are more of them in the blood. Also, with falciparum malaria, the red blood cells are sticky. This makes the red blood cells block blood vessels . If blood vessels are blocked, this can hurt what the blood vessel brings blood to, and can hurt people's organs .
Pregnant women and children are hurt most by malaria. When they get malaria, they get sicker.
40% of people live in a place where there is malaria. Malaria is in these places:
Every year, 300 to 700 million people get malaria. It kills 1 million to 2 million people every year. 90% of the deaths occur in Africa. Most of the people who die from malaria are children. Even if children do not die, many have brain damage.
Many of these deaths might be stopped with medicine or mosquito control. But many of the places malaria may be found are in poor countries. These countries do not have enough money to stop the mosquitoes, or to give people medicine. Money, however, is not the only problem. A country must have an organised medical system to provide services. Many countries in central Africa have been disrupted by warfare and conflict between groups, and general unrest. Also, easy solutions to kill the parasites do not exist as they did 50 years ago. This is because the insects are resistant to many insecticides , and the Plasmodium parasite is highly resistant to quinine and most other common drugs. This is a normal evolutionary process: the chemicals weed out the non-resistant organisms, and the offspring of the few resistant organisms multiply.
Symptoms are changes in someone's body that are signs for a disease. Most people who get malaria get symptoms 10–30 days after they get infected (the Plasmodium gets in their blood.) But some people can get symptoms after only a week, and some may be infected with malaria and not have symptoms for a year.
The most common symptom of malaria is fever , when the body temperature is high. The fever from malaria usually comes very suddenly. The people who have malaria often feel like they had influenza .
Symptoms of malaria are:
Signs of malaria:
Complications are problems that happen because of a disease.
Pregnant women and young children have more complications. People who get malaria for the first time have more complications. Falciparum malaria has the most complications.
Complications of malaria are:

A clinical diagnosis is based on the signs and symptoms of a disease, it is a diagnosis made without medical testing. In the case of malaria one of the main symptoms which may lead to a clinical diagnosis of malaria is a fever.
Any clinical diagnosis of malaria should be confirmed by a trained professional based upon laboratory results as soon as it is possible. [6]
A Malaria rapid diagnostic test is a blood test which can confirm a diagnosis of malaria in about twenty minutes. RDTs are not foolproof and have a number of drawbacks, and as such a negative rapid diagnostic test should not be accepted at face-value and follow-up with malaria microscopy is necessary.
To see if patients have malaria, doctors may do a blood test. This test is called a Giemsa blood smear . Blood is put on a slide which is a thin piece of glass. The Giemsa stain is put on the slide. This stain helps doctors see the malaria. Then they look at the slide under a microscope . The Plasmodium is seen in the red blood cells .
People with different kinds of malaria need different medicines. The medicine that works for one kind of malaria may not for another kind. So it is very important to know which species of Plasmodium the person has.
If the species is not known, the person should be given medicine and care like they have falciparum malaria – the worst kind.
It is also important to know where the person got malaria. Plasmodium in some places is resistant to some medicines. So the medicines to treat malaria in Africa are different from the medicines to treat malaria from South America.
Everywhere except New Guinea , the treatment is the same. In New Guinea most P. vivax is resistant to chloroquine . It can be treated with quinine , but this medicine can make people sick. Everywhere else, non- falciparum malaria is treated with chloroquine.
Chloroquine kills the Plasmodium in the blood. But the Plasmodium in the liver is not killed by chloroquine. P. vivax and P. ovale both stay in the liver a long time. This is the dormant phase . Another medicine must be given with chloroquine for P. vivax and P. ovale . This is to kill the Plasmodium in the liver. The medicine used to kill malaria in the liver is primaquine . In southeast Asia, some P. vivax is resistant to primaquine. Most other places, primaquine works very well.
Some people get very sick from primaquine . So people have to be tested to see if they have G6PD-deficiency before they take primaquine .
Falciparum is the worst kind of malaria. People with falciparum malaria should be treated in a hospital if they are:
Even people who are treated with medicines at home should stay with the doctor for 8 hours. This is to make sure they do not get sicker.It also makes sure they can take the medicines by mouth. Malaria does not start to become a life-threatening disease until it has been a couple of weeks after the bite without being treated.
Falciparum malaria also has more resistance to medicines. This makes it much harder to treat. Falciparum malaria is always treated with two or more medicines. Doctors choose the medicines by where in the world the person got malaria. Different places have P. falciparum that is resistant to different medicines.
The most important resistance is chloroquine-resistance. In some places in the world, P. falciparum is killed by chloroquine. In some places it is chloroquine-resistant. This means chloroquine does not kill it. In these places quinine can be used. Quinine is taken by mouth.
There are three ways to prevent malaria:
Vector control is one way to stop malaria. Vector means an organism that carries an infectious disease to another organism. For malaria, the vector is the Anopheles mosquito.
The most used method of vector control is pesticides . These are chemicals that kill the mosquito. The first pesticide used for vector control was DDT . DDT worked very well for vector control. It killed mosquitoes. It did not make people very sick at the time it was used. It did not cost very much money. Other chemicals for vector control had not been invented yet.
In many places mosquitoes became resistant to DDT. This meant that DDT did not work anymore in these areas. Scientists worried that DDT was making people and animals sick. It killed a lot of wildlife too. DDT also stays in the environment for a long time. For these reasons, people mostly use other chemicals for vector control. Organophosphate or carbonate pesticides are used, like malathion or bendiocarb .
Vector control is not the only way to stop malaria. And DDT is not the only chemical that can be used for vector control. The best way to stop malaria is to use a combination of methods. In some places, DDT may be a useful part of a program to stop malaria. This is why DDT is still allowed to be used for controlling malaria.
The mosquito that carries malaria comes more at dawn (when the sun comes up) and dusk (when the sun goes down.) Be most careful at these times. Wear long trousers and shirts with long sleeves. Wear mosquito repellent (this is a chemical that mosquitoes do not like, so they do not bite.) Mosquitoes will bite through thin cloth. So repellent should be used on skin and clothes .
Pesticides can be used in rooms to kill mosquitoes. When sleeping outside, people use a mosquito net. This is made from cloth that air can go through but keeps mosquitoes out. It is put over a bed where people sleep to keep mosquitoes out. Sometimes people also use it when they are not sleeping. It is best to use mosquito nets that have been treated with Permethrin, which repels and kills mosquitoes.
People can take medicine when they are in a place where there is malaria. This reduces the chances that they contract malaria. This is called prophylaxis .
Some people take prophylactic medicines for years. Many people in areas where there is malaria do not have the money to buy this medicine.
People who live where there is no malaria usually have not had malaria. The first case malaria is usually much worse. So people from places where there is no malaria may take prophylactic medicines when they go to places where there is malaria. The kind of prophylactic medicines people take depends on where they are. This is because not all medicines work on the malaria in every place.
To make them work best, prophylactic medicines have to be taken the right way. The medicine should start before going to an area with malaria. Most medicines should be taken for 4 weeks after coming home. One medicine (Malarone) only needs to be used for one week after coming home.
There are some children in Tanzania who are naturally immune to malaria. Researchers are using this to develop a new vaccine . U.S. researchers have found the children produce an antibody which attacks the malaria-causing parasite. Injecting a form of this antibody into mice protected the animals from the disease. The researchers plan to do tests on primates , including humans. [7]
It was Britain's Sir Ronald Ross , working in the Presidency General Hospital in the Kolkata , who finally proved in 1898 that malaria is transmitted by anopheles mosquitoes. [8] [9] He did this by showing that certain mosquito species transmit malaria to birds. He isolated malaria parasites from the salivary glands of mosquitoes that had fed on infected birds. [10] For this work, Ross received the 1902 Nobel Prize in Medicine. After resigning from the Indian Medical Service, Ross worked at the newly established Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and directed malaria-control efforts in Egypt , Panama , Greece and Mauritius . [11] The findings of Finlay and Ross were later confirmed by a medical board headed by Walter Reed in 1900. Its recommendations were used during construction of the Panama Canal . This public-health work saved the lives of thousands of workers and helped develop the methods used in future public-health campaigns against the  disease.
The first effective treatment for malaria came from the bark of cinchona tree , which contains quinine . This tree grows on the slopes of the Andes , mainly in Peru . The indigenous peoples of Peru made a tincture of cinchona to control malaria.  The Jesuits noted the efficacy of the practice and introduced the treatment to Europe during the 1640s, where it was rapidly accepted. [12] It was not until 1820 that the active ingredient, quinine, was extracted from the bark, isolated and named by French chemists. [13]
In the early 20th century, before antibiotics became available, Julius Wagner-Jauregg discovered that patients with syphilis could be treated by intentionally infecting them with malaria. The resulting fever would kill the syphilis spirochaetes , and quinine could be administered to control the malaria. Although some patients died from malaria, this was preferable to the almost-certain death from syphilis. [14]
Malaria was the largest hazard encountered by U.S. troops in the South Pacific during World War II , where about 500,000 men were infected. [15] Sixty thousand American soldiers died of malaria during the North African and South Pacific campaigns. [16]
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lupus
Lupus , or Lupus erythematosus , is a disease of the immune system . It is chronic , which means it does not go away. It is an autoimmune disease , where the person's immune system attacks their own body.
The immune system is partly made up of white blood cells in your body that fight off disease. In lupus, these white blood cells think that the healthy cells of the body around them are diseased, so they end up attacking healthy parts of the body. Lupus can be deadly . It causes swelling and tissue damage , and can attack any part of the body. It most commonly affects the heart , joints , skin , lungs , blood vessels , kidneys and the brain / nervous system . Some symptoms include: fatigue, fever with no cause, hair loss, mouth sores, sensitivity to sunlight, a skin disease, and Raynaud's syndrome . There is treatment for lupus, called immunosuppression , which is medicine that stops the white blood cells from damaging healthy cells for a while. After a while, this medicine wears off, and then the white blood cells go back to hurting healthy parts of the body again. For the disease of lupus, there is no cure that stops the white blood cells from attacking healthy parts of the body forever, but doctors are not giving up on finding a cure.
Lupus takes its name from the Latin word "lupus", meaning wolf . This is because a lupus-caused rash on a person's face makes the person's face look like the face of a wolf . In the United States alone, there may be 270,000 to 1.5 million (1,500,000) people with lupus. Worldwide , it is estimated (not known for sure, but a good guess) that over 5 million (5,000,000) people living with lupus. [1] The disease mainly affects young women , but men can be affected as well.
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis
Arthritis is a group of diseases where a person or animal's body joints are damaged. "Arthritis" means inflammation of bone or body joint . Arthritis can cause pain, swelling, and stiffness. It can hurt to move with arthritis. Arthritis is a condition that lasts for a long time. [1]
There are more than 100 kinds of arthritis. The three most common kinds are osteoarthritis , rheumatoid arthritis , and gout .  Other kinds of arthritis include psoriatic arthritis and septic arthritis (when an area is invaded by bacteria ).
Osteoarthritis is when the cartilage in between two bones breaks down. This condition causes the bones to rub together. This kind of arthritis is more common in elderly people. The most common places for this arthritis are the hips, knees, lower back, and neck. There are medicines that can relieve the pain and prevent disability. [2]
Rheumatoid arthritis is caused by autoimmunity . Autoimmunity is when the body's immune system attacks its own tissues. The most common places for this arthritis is in the wrists and the knuckles. It usually starts between the ages of 20 and 40. Children and elderly people can also get this kind of arthritis. There are medicines to slow down the process of this disease. There are also some medicines to relieve pain. It is important to treat this kind of arthritis early. [2]
Gout causes severe pain and swelling. Gout normally affects the big toe. It can also affect heels, ankles, hands, wrists or elbows. Gout is from high levels of uric acid that is in the blood. Gout can cause urate crystals to settle in tissues of joints. Gout creates stone-like shapes. The stone-like shapes build in joints, ligaments and tendons. [2]
Arthritis is more common in older people. Both osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis affect women more often than men.
Animals, including dogs and cats, can also get arthritis. [3]
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_review
Peer review is a process used when publishing documents where the work is reviewed by the author's peer group (someone in their field). It is a way of checking and reviewing a person's work. It is often used by scientists, scholars, medical professionals, engineers, and in some aspects of government. [1]
For example, scientists report new discoveries through a peer review process. This means that they ask other knowledgeable scientists (peers) to review their report, and check for any problems. The problems must be fixed before the report is released to other scientists. This process helps to maintain the trustworthiness of scientific discoveries.

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Fauci
Anthony Stephen Fauci ( / ˈ f aʊ tʃ i / ; born December 24, 1940) is an American immunologist . He works for the National Institutes of Health of the  United States. He is the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). He became well known in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States for his information about preventing the spread of disease .
He has been called "the nation’s leading expert on infectious diseases". [1] He is a member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force on the 2020 coronavirus pandemic .
On December 4, 2020, newly elected President Joe Biden announced that Fauci would serve as Chief Medical Advisor to the President in the Biden administration. [2]

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House
The White House is the home and main workplace of the President of the United States . The house was designed by Irish-born James Hoban and built by slaves . [2] [3] It is at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW in Washington, D.C. .
The building was built between 1792 and 1800 out of white-painted sandstone from Aquia Creek in Virginia . Hundreds of black slaves were forced to build the White House along with free workers. [3] It was designed in the Neoclassical style . It has been the home of every U.S. President since John Adams . When Thomas Jefferson moved into the house in 1801, he (with architect Benjamin Henry Latrobe ) expanded the building outward. They made two colonnades that were meant to hide stables and storage. [4] It was originally called the Executive Mansion before being renamed the White House by President Theodore Roosevelt . [5]
In 1814, during the War of 1812 , the mansion was set on fire by the British Army in the Burning of Washington. Some of the soldiers who burned it were former slaves who had run away from their owners to fight with the British. They ate dinner in the house before setting it on fire. [6] The fire destroyed the inside of the house and charred much of the outside. Reconstruction began almost immediately. President James Monroe moved into the partially reconstructed house in October 1817. Construction continued with the addition of the South Portico in 1824 and the North in 1829.
Because of crowding within the executive mansion itself, President Theodore Roosevelt had all work offices moved to the newly constructed West Wing in 1901.  Eight years later, President William Howard Taft expanded the West Wing and created the first Oval Office . This was eventually moved as the section was expanded. The third-floor attic was changed into living quarters in 1927. A newly built East Wing was used as a reception area for social events. Jefferson's colonnades connected the new wings. East Wing changes were completed in 1946. These changes made more office space. By 1948, the house's load-bearing exterior walls and internal wood beams were found to be close to failure. Under Harry S. Truman , the interior rooms were completely taken apart and a new internal load-bearing steel frame was built inside the walls. Once this work was done, the interior rooms were rebuilt.
Today, the White House Complex includes the Executive Residence, West Wing, East Wing, Blair House, and the Old Executive Office Building , a separate building west of the West Wing, which houses the executive offices of the President and Vice President .
During the COVID-19 pandemic , there was an outbreak of COVID-19 at the White House in October 2020. [7] During the outbreak, President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump were diagnosed with the infection. [8]
The White House is made up of six stories— the two story basement, The Ground Floor, The State Floor, The Second Floor and The Third Floor.The term White House is regularly used as a metonym for the Executive Office of the President of the United States and for the president's administration and advisers in general. The property is owned by the National Park Service and is part of the President's Park. In 2007, it was ranked second on the American Institute of Architects list of " America's Favorite Architecture ."
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebola
Ebola virus or Ebola virus disease (EVD) , often shortened to Ebola is a very dangerous virus . It belongs to the family Filoviridae and is responsible for a severe disease characterized by the sudden onset of hemorrhagic fever accompanied by other non specific signs and symptoms.  "Hemorrhagic" means that the victim will bleed a lot, inside and outside their body. The virus attacks almost every organ and tissue of the human body resulting in multi-organ dysfunction. Out of every 100 people who get Ebola, on average 25 to 90 die. There are four kinds of Ebola virus that can cause the disease. The virus was first found in Sudan . It is found in Africa , with very few cases in Europe and the United States . [1]
The Ebola virus that makes people sick lives in the blood and other liquids and wet things in some kinds of non-human animals without killing them. Scientists think the animals it lives in are mainly some kinds of monkeys or fruit bats . When people touch animals that have the virus, or wet things that came out of those animals, they can get sick. [2]
Ebola cannot be caught through the air, or by being near sick people. [3] The virus can only go from liquids into people's bodies. This means Ebola can be caught by touching a sick person's blood , saliva , mucus , semen , diarrhea , vomit , or other fluids that come out of a sick person's body.
If a person does not die from the disease, he can still give other people the infection by having sex for nearly another two months after they stop being sick. This is because the virus can still be in the man's semen after a long time.
1. Once the virus enters the human body via mucosal surfaces, abrasions or injuries in the skin or by direct parental transmission, it fuses with the cells lining the respiratory tract, eyes, or body cavities.
2. It invades the macrophages and dendritic immune cells and releases its genetic content. The cell explosion triggers the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines initiating a ‘cytokine storm’. The genetic material takes over the cell machinery to replicate itself; new copies of the virus are formed and released into the system.
3. The virus then, goes on to attack spleen, kidneys and even the brain. The blood vessels leak blood and fluid into the surrounding tissues. This atypical clotting and bleeding at the same time manifests externally in the form of rashes.
4. The virus causes the shutdown of other vital organs such as liver and lungs too. In fact, it is able to invade almost all human cells through different attachment mechanisms for each cell type (except for lymphocytes). The very cells that are meant to fight infection are used as carriers to spread infection to other body parts
5. It has been found that the ebola-infected cells do not undergo normal apoptosis, but exhibit vacuolization and signs of necrosis.
When people get Ebola the first symptoms look like some other diseases. People get a fever and feel very tired. Their head , stomach , joints , and throat might hurt. Sometimes, people think they have other diseases like malaria or typhoid fever .
Later, people get much sicker. They bleed both inside and outside their bodies. They have blood in their diarrhea and vomit . They bleed from their noses , mouths , and genitals /sex organs. They get shock : low blood pressure , fast pulse ( heart rate), and low blood circulation to the body. Their organs might stop working. Ebola also causes stiffness throughout the body which makes it hard for sick people to move.
Five to nine out of every ten people who get sick with Ebola die.
There is no cure for Ebola, but if people get care quickly from doctors and nurses at a hospital , more of them live. People with Ebola need a lot of fluids to replace fluids lost from diarrhea , vomiting , and bleeding. The most important care is giving them water with a very small amount of salt and sugar in it. This is called oral rehydration . It helps to replace their fluids and blood. It is also important to give medicines in case they get bad blood pressure and blood circulation.
In December 2016, a study found the VSV-EBOV vaccine to be very effective (in the neighborhood of 70–100%) against the Ebola virus, making it the first vaccine against the disease.
Many Ebola vaccine candidates had been developed in the decade prior to 2014, but as of October 2014, none had yet been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in humans.

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/US$
The United States dollar (or American dollar ) is the official currency ( money ) of the United States of America . It is also used in some other countries outside the US . It is the standard currency for international markets selling goods such as gold and oil ( petrol ). When writing, the symbol for the American dollar is the dollar sign ( $ ). Dollars can also be known as USD (standing for 'U.S. dollar').
The American one dollar bill has a picture of George Washington . There are currently paper bills (currency) of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 dollars.
All U.S. dollar currency has been the same size, shape and general design since 1928. This is unlike some countries where bank notes with different values have different sizes.
The U.S. also has dollar coins . Some are silver colored and some are gold colored. Vending machines often give dollar coins as change, since it is easier for the machines to give out coins than paper money. Some of the more advanced vending machines give out paper money as change. Paper dollars are much more common than dollar coins.
The US dollar in subdivided into cents, and 100 cents equals 1 US dollar. One cent can be written as either $0.01 or 1¢. The cent or " penny " (not to be confused with the English penny sterling ) is the least worth coin used in the U.S.. There are several different coins with different cent values of different materials and sizes. There is the penny (1¢ or $0.01), nickel (5¢ or $0.05), dime (10¢ or $0.10), quarter (25¢ or $0.25), and the much rarer half-dollar (50¢ or $0.50). [1] All coins and paper bills have the faces of famous Americans on the front side.
The paper "dollar bill" is actually called a " Federal Reserve Note".  Federal Reserve notes are legal tender currency notes. The twelve Federal Reserve Banks issue them into circulation pursuant to the Federal Reserve Act of 1913. A commercial bank belonging to the Federal Reserve System can obtain Federal Reserve notes from the Federal Reserve Bank in its district whenever it wishes by paying for them in full, dollar for dollar, from its account with Federal Reserve Bank.
Federal Reserve Banks get the notes from the U.S. Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP). It pays the BEP for the cost of producing the notes.
Congress has specified that a Federal Reserve Bank must hold collateral equal in value to the Federal Reserve notes that the Bank receives. This collateral is chiefly gold certificates and United States securities. This provides backing for the note issue.
Federal Reserve notes are not redeemable in gold, silver or any other commodity, and receive no backing by anything. This has been the case since 1933. The notes have no value for themselves, but for what they will buy.
The Coinage Act of 1965 titled "Legal tender" states: "United States coins and currency (including Federal reserve notes and circulating notes of Federal reserve banks and national banks) are legal tender for all debts, public charges, taxes, and dues".
This statute means that all United States money as identified above are a valid and legal offer of payment for debts when tendered to a creditor. There is no Federal statute saying a person or organization must accept currency or coins as payment for goods and/or services. Private businesses are free to develop their own policies on whether or not to accept cash. But there might be a State law which says otherwise. For example, a bus line may prohibit payment of fares in pennies or dollar bills. In addition, movie theaters, convenience stores and gas stations may refuse to accept large denomination currency (usually notes above $20) as a matter of policy. [2]
The public typically obtains its cash from banks by withdrawing cash from automated teller machines (ATMs) or by cashing checks. The amount of cash that the public holds varies seasonally, by the day of the month, and even by the day of the week. For example, people demand a large amount of cash for shopping and vacations during the year-end holiday season. Also, people typically withdraw cash at ATMs over the weekend, so there is more cash in circulation on Monday than on Friday.
To meet the demands of their customers, banks get cash from Federal Reserve Banks. Most medium- and large-sized banks maintain reserve accounts at one of the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks, and they pay for the cash they get from the Fed by having those accounts debited. Some smaller banks maintain their required reserves at larger, "correspondent," banks. The smaller banks get cash through the correspondent banks, which charge a fee for the service. The larger banks get currency from the Fed and pass it on to the smaller banks.
When the public's demand for cash declines—after the holiday season, for example—banks find they have more cash than they need and they deposit the excess at the Fed. Because banks pay the Fed for cash by having their reserve accounts debited, the level of reserves in the nation's banking system drops when the public's demand for cash rises; similarly, the level rises again when the public's demand for cash subsides and banks ship cash back to the Fed. The Fed offsets variations in the public's demand for cash that could introduce volatility into credit markets by implementing open market operations.
The popularization of the ATM in recent years has increased the public's demand for currency and, in turn, the amount of currency that banks order from the Fed. Interestingly, the advent of the ATM has led some banks to request used, fit bills, rather than new bills, because the used bills often work better in the ATMs.
Each of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks keeps an inventory of cash on hand to meet the needs of the depository institutions in its District. Extended custodial inventory sites in several continents promote the use of U.S. currency internationally, improve the collection of information on currency flows, and help local banks meet the public's demand for U.S. currency. Additions to that supply come directly from the two divisions of the Treasury Department that produce the cash: the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, which prints currency, and the United States Mint, which makes coins. Most of the inventory consists of deposits by banks that had more cash than they needed to serve their customers and deposited the excess at the Fed to help meet their reserve requirements.
When a Federal Reserve Bank receives a cash deposit from a bank, it checks the individual notes to determine whether they are fit for future circulation. About one-third of the notes that the Fed receives are not fit, and the Fed destroys them. As shown in the table below, the life of a note varies according to its denomination. For example, a $1 bill, which gets the greatest use, remains in circulation an average of 5.9 years; a $100 bill lasts about 15 years. Federal Reserve Bank of New York on Sunday night Cole

India ( Hindi : Bhārat ), officially the Republic of India ( Hindi : Bhārat Gaṇarājya ) is a country in South Asia . It is second largest country in population and seventh largest country by land area. It is also the most populous democracy in the world, [18] [19] bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast. It has seven neighbors: Pakistan in north-west, China , Nepal and Bhutan in north, Bangladesh an Myanmar in east and Sri Lanka in south.
The capital of India is New Delhi . India is a peninsula , bound by the Indian Ocean in the south, the Arabian Sea on the west and Bay of Bengal in the east. The coastline of India is of about 7,517 km (4,671 mi) long. [20] India has the third largest military force in the world and is also a nuclear weapon state. [21]
India's economy became the world's fastest growing in the G20 developing nations in the last quarter of 2014, replacing the People's Republic of China . [22] India's literacy and wealth are also rising. [23] According to New World Wealth, India is the seventh richest country in the world with a total individual wealth of $5.6 trillion. [24] [25] However, it still has many social and economic issues like poverty and corruption . India is a founding member of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), and has signed the Kyoto Protocol .
India has the fourth largest number of spoken languages per country in the world, only behind Papua New Guinea , Indonesia , and Nigeria . [26] People of many different religions live there, including the five most popular world religions: Hinduism , Buddhism , Sikhism , Islam , and Christianity . The first three religions came from the Indian subcontinent along with Jainism.
The National emblem of India shows four lions standing back-to-back. The lions symbolise power, pride, confidence, and courage (bravery). Only the government can use this emblem, according to the State Emblem of India (Prohibition of Improper Use) Act, 2005
The name India comes from the Greek word, Indus . This came from the word sindhu , which in time turned into Hind or Hindi or Hindu . The preferred native name or endonym is "Bharat" in Hindi and other Indian languages as contrasted with names from outsiders. Some of the national symbols are:
National anthem - Jana Gana Mana
National song - Vande Mataram
National animal - Bengal tiger
National bird - Peacock
National flower - Lotus
National tree - Banyan
National river - Ganges (Ganga)
National fruit - Mango
National heritage animal - Elephant
National heritage bird - Indian eagle
Two of the main classical languages of the world Tamil language and Sanskrit language were born in India. Both of these languages are more than 3000 years old. [28] The country founded a religion called Hinduism , which most Indians still follow. Later, a king named Chandragupt Maurya built an empire called  the Maurya Empire in 300 BC. It made most of South Asia into one whole country. [29] From 180 BC, many other countries invaded India. Even later (100 BC  AD 1100), other Indian dynasties (empires) came, including the Chalukyas, Cholas, Pallavas, and Pandyas. [30] Southern India at that time was famous for its science, art, and writing. The Cholas of Thanjavur were pioneers at war in the seas and invaded Malaya , Borneo , Cambodia . The influence of Cholas are still well noticeable in SE Asia . [31]
Many dynasties ruled India around the year 1000. Some of these were the Mughal , Vijayanagara , and the Maratha empires. In the 1600s, European countries invaded India, and the British controlled most of India by 1856. [32]
In the early 1900s, millions of people peacefully started to protest against British control. One of the people who led the freedom movement was Mahatma Gandhi , who only used peaceful tactics, including a way called " ahimsa ", which means "non-violence". [33] On 15 August 1947, India peacefully became free and independent from the British Empire . India's constitution was founded on 26 January 1950. Every year, on this day, Indians celebrate Republic Day. The first official leader ( Prime Minister ) of India was Jawaharlal Nehru .
After 1947, India had a socialist planned economy. It is one of the founding members of the Non-Aligned Movement and the United Nations . It has fought many wars since independence from Britain , including the wars in 1947-48, 1965, 1971, and 1999 with Pakistan and in 1962 with China . It also fought a war to capture Goa , a Portuguese -built port and a city which was not a part of India until 1961. The Portuguese refused to give it to the country, and so India had to use force and the Portuguese were defeated. India has also done nuclear tests in 1974 and 1998, and it is one of the few countries that has nuclear bombs . [34] Since 1991, India has been one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. [35]
India is the largest democracy in the world. [36]
India's government is divided into three parts: the Legislative (the one that makes the laws, the Parliament), the Executive (the government), and the Judiciary (the one that makes sure that the laws are obeyed, the supreme court).
The legislative branch is made up of the Parliament of India, which is in New Delhi , the capital of India. The Parliament of India is divided into two houses: the upper house, Rajya Sabha (Council of States); and the lower house, Lok Sabha (House of People). The Rajya Sabha has 250 members, [37] and the Lok Sabha has 552 members. [37]
The executive branch is made up of the President , Vice President , Prime Minister , and the Council of Ministers. The President of India is elected for a period of five years. The President can choose the Prime Minister, who has most of the power. The Council of Ministers, such as the Minister of Defence, help the Prime Minister. Narendra Modi became the Prime Minister of India on May 16, 2014. He is the 19th Prime Minister of India. The president has less power than the prime minister.
The judicial branch is made up of the courts of India, including the Supreme Court. The Chief Justice of India is the head of the Supreme Court. Supreme Court members have the power to stop a law being passed by Parliament if they think that the law is illegal and contradicts (opposes) the Constitution of India. [38] In India, there are also 24 High Courts.
India is the seventh biggest country in the world. It is the main part of the Indian subcontinent . The countries next to India are Pakistan , Bangladesh , Myanmar , China , Bhutan , and Nepal . It is also near Sri Lanka , an island country.
India is a peninsula , which means that it is surrounded on three sides by water. One of the seven wonders of the world is in Agra: the Taj Mahal. In the west is the Arabian Sea , in the south is the Indian Ocean , and in the east is the Bay of Bengal . The northern part of India has many mountains. The most famous mountain range in India is the Himalayas , which have some of the tallest mountains in the world. There are many rivers in India. The main rivers are the Ganges , the Brahmaputra , the Yamuna , the Godavari, the Kaveri, the Narmada, and the Krishna.
India has different climates. [39] In the South, the climate is mainly tropical, which means it can get very hot in summer and cool in winter. [39] The northern part, though, has a cooler climate, called sub-tropical, and even alpine in mountainous regions. [39] The Himalayas , in the alpine climate region, can get extremely cold. There is very heavy rainfall along the west coast and in the Eastern Himalayan foothills. The west, though, is drier. Because of some of the deserts of India, all of India gets rain for four months of the year. That time is called the monsoon. That is because the deserts attract water-filled winds from the Indian Ocean, which give rain when they come into India. When the monsoon rains come late or not so heavily, droughts (when the land dries out because there is less rain) are possible. Monsoons normally come around July - August.
The Indian Armed Forces is the military of India. It is made up of an Army , Navy and Air Force . There are other parts like Paramilitary and Strategic Nuclear Command.
The President of India is the Commander-in-Chief. However, it is managed by the Ministry of Defence. In 2010, the Indian Armed Forces had 1.32 million active personnel. This makes it one of the largest militaries in the world. [40]
The Indian Army is becoming more modern by buying and making new weapons. It is also building defenses against missiles of other countries. [41] In 2011, India imported more weapons than any other nation in the world. [42]
From its independence in 1947, India fought four wars with Pakistan and a war with China.
For administration purposes, India has been divided into smaller pieces. Most of these pieces are called states , some are called union territories . States and union territories are different in the way they are represented. Most union territories are ruled by administrators sent by the central government. All the states, and the territories of Delhi, and Puducherry elect their local government themselves. In total, there are twenty-eight states, and nine union territories. [43]
States:
Union territories:
There are disputes about certain parts of the Indian borders. Countries do not agree on where the borders are. [44] Pakistan and China do not recognise the disputed territory of Jammu and Kashmir . [45] The Indian government claims it as an Indian state. [45] Similarly, the Republic of India does not recognise the Pakistani and Chinese parts of Kashmir. [45]
In 1914, British India and Tibet agreed on the McMahon Line , as part of the Simla Accord . [46] In July 1914, China withdrew from the agreement. [46] Indians and Tibetans see this line as the official border. China does not agree, and both mainland China and Taiwan do not recognize that  Arunachal Pradesh belongs to India. According to them, it is a part of South Tibet , which belongs to China. [47] [48]
The economy of the country is among the world's fastest growing. It is the 7th largest in the world with a nominal GDP of $ 2,250 billion ( USD ), and in terms of PPP , the economy is 3rd largest (worth $8.720 trillion USD). [49] The growth rate is 8.25% for fiscal 2010. However, that is still $3678 (considering PPP) per person per year. India's economy is based mainly on:
India's economy is diverse. Major industries include automobiles , cement , chemicals , consumer electronics , food processing , machinery , mining , petroleum , pharmaceuticals , steel , transportation equipment, and textiles . [50]
However, despite economic growth, India continues to suffer from poverty . 27.5% of the population was living in poverty in 2004–2005. [51] In addition, 80.4% of the population live on less than USD $2 a day, [52] which was lowered to 68% by 2009. [53]
There are 1.21 billion people living in India. [54] India is the second largest country by the number of people living in it, with China being the first. Experts think that by the year 2030, India will be the first. [55] About 65% of Indians live in rural areas , or land set aside for farming. [56] The largest cities in India are Mumbai , Kolkata , Delhi , Chennai , Bangalore , Hyderabad , and Ahmedabad . [43] India has 23 official languages. [57] Altogether, 1,625 languages are spoken in India. [38]
There are many different languages and cultures in India. The only geographical place with more different languages and cultures is the African continent . [43] There are two main language families in India, the Indo-Aryan and the Dravidian languages . About 69% of Indians speak an Indo-Arayan language, about 26% speak a Dravidian language. Other languages spoken in India come from the Austro-Asiatic group. Around 5% of the people speak  a Tibeto-Burman language.
Hindi is the official language in India with the largest number of speakers. [58] It is the official language of the union. [59] Native speakers of Hindi represent about 41% of the Indian population (2001 Indian census). English is also used, mostly for business and in the administration. It has the status of a 'subsidiary official language'. [60] The constitution also recognises 21 other languages. Either many people speak those languages, or they have been recognised to be very important for Indian culture. The number of dialects in India is as high as 1,652. [38]
In the south of India, many people speak Kannada , Telugu , Tamil and Malayalam . In the north, many people speak Chhattisgarhi , Punjabi , Bengali , Gujarati , and Marathi , Odia , and Bihari . [61] [62]
India has 27 official languages. Its constitution lists the name of the country in each of the languages. [63] Hindi and English (listed in boldface) are the "official languages of the union" (Union meaning the Federal Government in Delhi ); [64] Tamil , Sanskrit , Telugu , Kannada , Malayalam , and Odia are officially the " classical languages of India ."
Cave paintings from the Stone Age are found across India. They show dances and rituals and suggest there was a prehistoric religion. During the Epic and Puranic periods, the earliest versions of the epic poems Ramayana and Mahabharata were written from about 500–100 BCE, [66] although these were orally transmitted for centuries before this period. [67] Other South Asian Stone Age sites apart from Pakistan are in modern India, such as the Bhimbetka rock shelters in central Madhya Pradesh and the Kupgal petroglyphs of eastern Karnataka, contain rock art showing religious rites and evidence of possible ritualised music. [68]
Several modern religions are linked to India, [69] namely modern Hinduism , Jainism , Buddhism and Sikhism . All of these religions have different schools (ways of thinking) and traditions that are related. As a group they are called the Eastern religions . The Indian religions are similar to one another in many ways: The basic beliefs, the way worship is done and several religious practices are very similar. These similarities mainly come from the fact that these religions have a common history and common origins. They also influenced each other.
The religion of Hinduism is the main faith followed by 79.80% of people in the Republic of India; Islam – 14.23%; Christianity – 2.30%; Sikhism – 1.72%; Buddhism – 0.70% and Jainism – 0.37%. [70]
It's the first time ever since independence that Hindu population percentage fell below 80%.
India sent a spacecraft to Mars for the first time in 2014. That made it the third country and only Asian country to do so, successfully. India is the only country to be successful in its very first attempt to orbit Mars. It was called the Mars Orbiter Mission.
ISRO launched 104 satellites in a single mission to create world record. India became the first nation in the world to have launched over a hundred satellites in one mission. That was more than the 2014 Russian record of 37 satellites in a single launch.
India has the largest movie industry in the world. Indian Tamil movies are poular globally, especially movies of "Super Star" Rajinikanth. [ source? ] [71] Based in Mumbai (formerly Bombay ), the industry is also known as Bollywood . It makes 1,000 movies a year, about twice as many as Hollywood. [72] It produces movies almost everyday.
Indians have excelled in Hockey. They have also won eight gold, one silver and two bronze medals at the Olympic games . However, cricket is the most popular sport in India. The Indian cricket team won the 1983 and 2011 Cricket World Cup and the 2007 ICC World Twenty20 . They shared the 2002 ICC Champions Trophy with Sri Lanka and won the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy.Cricket in India is controlled by the Board of Control for Cricket in India or BCCI. Domestic tournaments are the Ranji Trophy, the Duleep Trophy, the Deodhar Trophy, the Irani Trophy and the Challenger Series. There is also the Indian cricket league and Indian premier league Twenty20 competitions.
Tennis has become popular due to the victories of the India Davis Cup team. Association football is also a popular sport in northeast India, West Bengal, Goa and Kerala. [73] The Indian national football team has won the South Asian Football Federation Cup many times. Chess , which comes from India, is also becoming popular. This is with the increase in the number of Indian Grandmasters. [74] Traditional sports include kabaddi, kho kho, and gilli-danda, which are played throughout India.

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rupee
The rupee is the name of a currency amount ("denomination" of money ) in various countries.
It is used in the Republic of India and Pakistan . It was also used in British India , the former East Pakistan until 1971, Sri Lanka , Nepal , Mauritius , and the Seychelles . In past times, rupees were also the name of the money used in Burma and in the German and British colonies in East Africa . The name comes from a Sanskrit word meaning silver . The rupiah of Indonesia and the rufiyah of the Maldives are kinds of money that also got their name from this word. All of these were previously Spanish dollars .

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llamas

A Llama ( Lama glama ) is a mammal of the Camelidae family. It is from South America , the Andes Mountains of Peru and Ecuador .
Sometimes the name llama is used for all four South American camelids .
The llama was domesticated about 5000 years ago. It was and is used for carrying things, and for wool . The llama was very important for the Incan people. Even today, llamas are used for similar reasons, but will more commonly be used as domesticated pets.
The llama's close relative is the alpaca , who is a more demure, petite animal in comparison to the llama. Llamas have three related cousins - the alpaca , the guanaco , and the vicuña . The llama is the national symbol of Bolivia.
Llamas spit, and travel together. Llamas also have a high content of hemoglobin which causes their blood cells to be oval and not circular. [1]

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibodies
Antibodies (also called immunoglobulins ) are large Y-shaped proteins that can stick to the surface of bacteria and viruses . They are found in the blood or other body fluids of vertebrates . Antibodies are the key element in the adaptive immune system .
The antibody recognizes a unique part of the foreign target called an antigen . [1] [2] Each tip of the "Y" of an antibody contains a structure (like a lock) that fits one particular key-like structure on an antigen. This binds the two structures together.
Using this binding mechanism, an antibody can tag a microbe or an infected cell for attack by other parts of the immune system, or can neutralize its target directly. [3] The production of antibodies is the main function of humoral immunity . [4] [5]
Each antibody is different. They are all designed to attack only one kind of antigen (in practice, this means virus or bacteria). For instance, an antibody designed to destroy smallpox is unable to hit the bubonic plague or the common cold.
Though the general structure of all antibodies is very similar, that small region at the tip of the protein is extremely variable. This allows millions of antibodies with different tip structures to exist. Each of these variants can bind to a different antigen. [1] This enormous diversity of antibodies allows the immune system to recognize an equally wide variety of antigens. [6]
Although a huge variety of different antibodies is made in a single individual, the number of genes available to make these proteins is limited by the size of the genome .
There are a vast number of microbe strains, and so vertebrates need millions of different antibodies. [7] Actually, humans generate about 10 billion different antibodies, each capable of binding a distinct antigen site. [8] This must be done with a very much smaller number of genes : the total human genome has only about 20,000 genes.
Several complex genetic mechanisms have evolved . These allow vertebrate B cells to generate a huge pool of antibodies from a relatively small number of antibody genes. [9] The full details are not presented here, just a summary.
The variety of antibodies is got by combining segments from a pool of genes in many different ways. Then, hyper - mutations occur in the binding site area of the antibody gene. This creates further diversity. [10] [11]
Antibodies are glycoproteins belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily; the terms antibody and immunoglobulin are often used interchangeably. [6] Antibodies are typically made of basic structural units—each with two large heavy chains and two small light chains . There are several different types of antibody heavy chains, and several different kinds of antibodies, which are grouped into different isotypes based on which heavy chain they possess. Five different antibody isotypes are known in mammals. They  help direct the appropriate immune response for each different type of foreign object they encounter. [10]
Though the general structure of all antibodies is very similar,  a small region at the tip of the protein is extremely variable, allowing millions of antibodies with slightly different tip structures, or antigen binding sites, to exist. This region is known as the hypervariable region . Each of these variants can bind to a different antigen. [1] This enormous diversity of antibodies allows the immune system to recognize an equally wide variety of antigens. [6] The large and diverse population of antibodies is generated by random combinations of a set of gene segments that encode different antigen binding sites (or paratopes ), followed by random mutations in this area of the antibody gene, which create further diversity. [10] [11] Antibody genes also re-organize in a process called class switching , which allows a single antibody to be used by several different parts of the immune system.
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)
In nutrition , diet is the sum of food that is eaten by a person or another organism . [1] Dietary habits are the usual decisions someone or a culture makes when choosing what foods to eat. With the word diet , it is often expressed the use of specific intake of nutrition for health or weight-management reasons (with the two often being related). Although humans are omnivores , each culture and each person holds some food preferences or some food taboos , due to personal tastes or ethical reasons. Individual dietary choices may be more or less healthful. A proper nutrition requires a proper ingestion and, also important, the absorption of vitamins , minerals , and food energy in the form of carbohydrates , proteins , and fats . Dietary habits and choices play a significant role in health and mortality , and can also define cultures and play a role in religion .
Diets are about eating the right quantity and type of food at the right time. When people talk about a diet, they are usually referring to a special kind of diet. When someone says they are "dieting", it means that they are trying to lose weight. People who study diet and eating habits are called dietitians .
When the diet is not right, people can gain or lose weight. They may become overweight or underweight. To get back to their normal weight, they need to change their diet. [2] This may be very hard to do. Often help from specialist is required.
Some people will also do fasting - they will not eat anything for some time to lose weight, balance their diet and clean their bodies. [3]
Some people have diseases where they cannot eat certain foods without becoming very sick. They need to change their diet to avoid these foods. A food allergy is a condition in which a specific food makes someone sick. Phenylketonuria is a disease in which a person cannot digest certain foods properly because they have an amino acid, or type of chemical, called phenylalanines in them.
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_vaccine
A COVID-19 vaccine is any of the vaccines used against the Coronavirus Disease 2019 ( COVID-19 pandemic ). In July 2020, more than 150 vaccines were being developed in different laboratories. [1] Two mRNA vaccines , one by Pfizer and one by Moderna , were approved late in 2020. Both are over 90% effective. [2] A few vaccines also went into use in early 2021.
Several countries plan to give the vaccine to many people, but their plans are different. The United Kingdom plans to use its National Health Service .  Canada plans to use its military. The United States plans to send vaccine to all fifty states and then let the state governments each make their own system. [3]
The United Kingdom approved the Pfizer vaccine before the European Union or United States did. They began giving it to people on December 8. [4] The United States began giving people the vaccine on December 14, starting with health care workers in New York City . [5] By April 2021, several vaccines were in use around the world and hundreds of millions of people had been vaccinated.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect a vaccine against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative virus, to become available in less than 18 months. [6] The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) – which is organizing a US$2 billion worldwide fund for fast investment and creation of vaccine candidates [7] – indicated in April that a vaccine may be available under emergency use protocols in less than 12 months or by early 2021. [8] On 4 May 2020, the WHO organized a telethon (fundraising event broadcasted via televisions) to raise US$8 billion from forty countries to support rapid development of vaccines to prevent COVID-19 infections and deaths. [9] The United States government started Operation Warp Speed to develop a vaccine by January 2021. [1]
PittCoVacc is a vaccine invented by scientists from the University of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania in the United States . [10] It was invented to protect people from SARS-CoV-2 , the virus that causes COVID-19 . It was the first vaccine candidate, meaning vaccine that scientists thought would work well, published in a peer-reviewed study, meaning a scientific paper that other vaccine experts had read and approved before it was printed for people to read. [11] [12]
As of April 2020, it has been tested in mice but not in human beings. [10] [11] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19]
PittCoVacc is short for "Pittsburgh coronavirus vaccine." [10]
One of the head scientists, Dr. Andrea Gambotto, said they made the vaccine so quickly because they had worked on other coronaviruses before: "We had previous experience on SARS-CoV in 2003 and MERS-CoV in 2014. These two viruses, which are closely related to SARS-CoV-2, teach us that a particular protein, called a spike protein, is important for inducing immunity against the virus. We knew exactly where to fight this new virus.  That's why it's important to fund vaccine research. You never know where the next pandemic will come from."
The researchers used laboratory equipment to make pieces of the same proteins that are in SARS-CoV-2. They put the proteins inside the bodies of laboratory mice using a microneedle array , meaning a small patch with about 400 tiny needles made out of other protein and sugar. One of the scientists, Dr. Emrullah Korkmaz, said these needles melt away inside the skin after they release the vaccine.  The skin is a good place to put a vaccine because it has many immune cells in it. Then the mice made antibodies, or protective molecules, in their blood. The scientists measured the amount of antibodies and guessed it would be enough to fight off the SARS-CoV-2 virus if the mice were exposed to it.  It took about two weeks for the mice to make lots of antibodies. [10]
The scientists said it would be easy to make large amounts of vaccine and large numbers of microneedle arrays to use on people.
Another team of scientists led by Dr. Josef Penninger of the University of British Columbia invented a medicine called  APN01. They tested APN01 in engineered human tissue. This is human cells put together to act like part of the body, but it is not a whole animal or person. They added a protein called "human recombinant soluble angiotensin converting  enzyme 2" (hrsACE2) and saw that it stopped the virus from taking over cells.  They named their hrsACE2 APN01. [20] [21]
Other scientists have developed vaccines that use messenger RNA to teach the body to recognize the virus.  They say mRNA vaccines take less time to develop and make, than protein or whole-virus vaccines. [22] [23]
Messenger RNA vaccine s need to be stored at very cold temperatures.  Ordinary refrigerators are not cold enough. [24]
In mid-May 2020, a company called Moderna said they tested their mRNA vaccine in forty-five people and eight of them produced antibodies [25] but they did not publish the specific data or publish an article in a scientific journal. [26] Anna Durbin of Johns Hopkins University said it was too soon to tell if people would keep the antibodies long enough for the vaccine to work. [27] The United States Food and Drug Administration gave Moderna permission to test the vaccine again in more people. Moderna's chief medical officer said the vaccine could be ready in January 2021. [25]
The Moderna vaccine entered stage-three clinical trials on June 27, 2020.  That means it is being tested on humans.  Dr. Anthony Fauci said he did not think the vaccine would be dangerous. [28]
On November 16, Moderna said its vaccine was 94.5% effective.  The vaccine has to kept colder than freezing but it does not have to be kept as cold as the Pfizer vaccine. [2] Distribution began in February 2021. [29]
The German company BioNTech and Pfizer made a deal with the United States government to make 100 million doses of mRNA vaccine by December 2020.  The vaccine completed phase I trials and started its next trial on July 27, 2020.  Instead of being a phase II trial or a phase III trial, Pfizer's team is trying to do both phases at once.  If the companies can make the vaccine on time, the U.S. government will give them almost US$2 billion.  The vaccine is called BNT162b2. [1] BioNTech paid its employees overtime to do extra work.  They called this "Project Lightspeed" because they wanted to develop the vaccine quickly. [24] [30]
Because they wanted people to trust the virus Pfizer published the study protocols publicly.  That means they told everyone exactly how they were testing the virus.  This is information that companies usually keep secret so no one can steal their work. [24]
On November 9, 2020, Pfizer announced that BNT162 was 90% effective at preventing people from catching COVID-19.  They asked the FDA to approve the vaccine for emergency use.  The company had not yet published the results of the study in a formal scientific paper, so the FDA said they needed time to look at the results for themselves. [24]
The adenovirus is the virus that causes the common cold. [1] It does not harm the human body much.  Scientists have used the adenovirus in vaccines for many years against many diseases.  Scientists take pieces of dangerous viruses and attach them to adenovirus.  Then they inject the adenovirus into a human body.  The human immune system learns to recognize the pieces of dangerous viruses.  Then it can fight off the real dangerous viruses if the human is ever exposed to them.
In late April 2020, a team from the University of Oxford said that they had developed a COVID-19 vaccine.  The United States National Institutes of Health tested it in rhesus monkeys , and it worked.  Because they had already been working on a vaccine against a different coronavirus, they had a head start working on one for SARS-CoV-2. They would try to test their vaccine on 6000 people by the end of May 2020, and that their vaccine could be ready for people to use in September 2020. [31] [32]
The team took the spike protein from SARS-CoV-2 and put it on an adenovirus.  Then they injected that virus into test patients.  The idea is that the patients' immune systems will learn to attack the spike protein no matter what virus it is on.  This vaccine completed phase I trials and as of July 2020 is entering phase III trials.  The vaccine is called ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. [1]
The Chinese company CanSino Biologics is making a viral vector vaccine.  This vaccine uses an adenovirus that has the spike protein from SARS-CoV-2 on it.  Then the immune system learns to recognize the spike protein.  As of July 2020, this vaccine is in phase II trials, but the Chinese government gave CanSino Biologics permission to give it to people anyway.  They are allowed to give it to people in the Chinese military. [1]
The Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine is made from the Johnson & Johnson company. Unlike many vaccines, it doesn't need special, unusual refrigeration.
The company Sinovac in China and Bututan research center in Brazil worked together.  This is an inactivated virus vaccine .  This means the team took SARS-CoV-2 and changed it to make it harmless.  The patient's body learns to recognize the harmless virus and then it can recognize the harmful, wild virus too.  The company got permission to start phase III trials on July 3.  This virus is called CoronaVac. [1]
The company Sinopharm belongs to the government of China.  It is an inactivated virus vaccine. [33] This vaccine started phase III trials in the middle of July 2020. This vaccine does not have a name. [1]
The University of Melbourne and Murdoch Children's Research Institute are studying a vaccine that works against tuberculosis , the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccine.  It is a live-bacterium vaccine.  That means weak but not dead Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria are injected into the patient.  Then their immune system learns to fight it.  Over the years, scientists saw that the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccine did not only protect people from tuberculosis.  It protected them from other diseases too.  The scientists at the Murdoch Children's Research Institute and University of Melbourne are studying the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccine to see if it will protect people from COVID-19.  Because this vaccine has already been used for other diseases for more than one hundred years, doctors already knew it was safe to use.  As of July 2020, this vaccine is in phase III trials to see if it works on COVID-19. [1]
Scientists believe a vaccine that doctors spray into the patient's nose would work better than a vaccine injected into the patient's veins.  After a nasal vaccine, the body's immune cells look for the virus in the nose and mouth.  The nose and mouth are where most people are infected with SARS-CoV-2.  Scientists are not sure why this works.  As of July 2020, teams in the Netherlands, the United States, and Canada are making nasal vaccines. [34]
As of January 27th, Israel is currently the leader in percentage of people vaccinated, followed by the USA and then the United Kingdom. Israel has reportedly vaccinated about 20% of it's population, or 2 million people. [35]
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_tea
The drink green tea ( simplified Chinese : 绿茶 ; traditional Chinese : 綠茶 ; pinyin : lǜchá ) is a "true" tea . It comes from the plant species Camellia sinensis . Green tea is a tea that has undergone little oxidation while it was processed. Green tea is popular in China , Taiwan , Hong Kong , Japan , Korea , and the Middle East . Recently it has been drunk more widely in the West , where usually black tea is consumed.
In the Kamakura period , a Buddhist monk , Eisai (1141–1215), and his follower, Dogen, first brought tea (maccha) to Japan. [1] He had learned about tea on a visit to China. Eisai taught people to grow the tea plants, and how to prepare the tea leaves. People drank tea for its benefit as a medicine rather than as a refreshment. [1] Tea-drinking gradually spread as part of Zen Buddhism. The tea ceremony was part of the training for mental discipline. Green tea kept the mind pure and relaxed, an effect caused by the caffeine in the tea. [1] The custom of drinking tea gradually spread throughout Japan.
In the Muromachi period , tea tasting competitions were popular. People also gambled on these competitions. Zen Buddhist master, Juko Murata (1422–1502) stopped these competitions. He broke with the grand tradition , and developed a small ceremony performed around the tatami mat. [2] The tea ceremony was perfected afterward in the Azuchimomoyama era by Jou Takeno and Sen no Rikyu (1522–1591). They removed all extra movements and unnecessary decoration and objects from the tea room. The idea, based on Zen, was to concentrate your attention on the wealth inside your mind. [1]
In the Edo period , the tea ceremony spread out to the public, and it became an artistic accomplishment. Therefore, "to draw out the beauty from inside the person's heart" which was its original purpose came to be emphasized. The words 和敬清寂 (Wa Kei Sei Jaku) meaning harmony , respect, purity and tranquility , are the basis of the tea ceremony. [3] Wa, harmony, is shown by sharing the tea between the host and the guest. [3] Kei, respect, is shown by accepting and sharing with others. [3] Sei, purity, is treating yourself and others openly. [3] Jaku, tranquility, is the feeling of stillness in the ceremony. [3] Modern tea ceremonies, which last for four hours, are still based on these ideas. [1]
In the Meiji period , the tea ceremony died out for while. They were restarted when it was added in a kind of education for girls. The ceremony also changed to being beautiful and gorgeous.
Nowadays, green tea is spreading all over the world, but it seems to be drunk with sugar in some countries because it tastes bitter.
Green tea seems to lower heart disease expectancy. [4]
The different substances contained in green tea also seem to help against cancer , low bone density, cognitive function and kidney stones . [5]
Green tea contains ascorbic acid , and different minerals, such as chromium , manganese , selenium or zinc . It is a better antioxidant than black tea . [5] Black tea contains certain substances which cannot be found in common green tea, such as theaflavin .
Studies done on animals have shown that it can reduce cholesterol . Trials done on humans have not confirmed this effect, however. In 2003 a randomized clinical trial found that a green tea extract with added theaflavin from black tea could reduce cholesterol. [6]
In a study performed at Birmingham (UK) University, it was shown that average fat oxidation rates were 17% higher after drinking of green tea extract than after a placebo was used. [7]
In a recent study of the eating habits of 2,018 women, consumption of mushrooms and green tea was linked to a 90% lower occurrence of breast cancer . [8]

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turmeric

Turmeric ( Curcuma longa ) is a spice, widely used in Asian cooking. It is a rhizomatous herbaceous perennial plant , in the ginger family, Zingiberaceae . [2]
Turmeric plants are widely grown in tropical areas of India, where over 70,000 acres are cultivated every year. The plant has long leaves, surrounding spikes where small flowers form. However the root, or ‘rhizome’ of the turmeric plant is harvested, in much the same way as ginger.  The turmeric rhizome takes about 10 months to grow before it can be harvested; it is then boiled, cleaned and dried in the sun. Most of the harvested turmeric is ground up and sold in jars for use in cooking, however the fresh root turmeric can also be used.
Turmeric is one of the main ingredients of curry powder, and is used to give it the characteristic yellow colour. It is also delicious added to rice dishes, seafood, and mustards and pickles.  
Turmeric is also more widely used as a colourant for textiles and food products. It is sometimes substituted for saffron as it is much less expensive, but produces the same yellow colour. Turmeric has also been used as an alternative to medicine and can be made into a drink to treat colds and stomach complaints. A regular intake of turmeric can be helpful in treating a patient afflicted with cystic fibrosis , a condition caused by faulty genes. [3] [4]

Time is an American news magazine . It was founded in 1923. It is printed every week in the United States . It is published by Time Inc. It has articles on politics and current events . It is read by more people than any other news magazine.
There is also a magazine called Time For Kids , aimed at children. That magazine is eight pages long and contains more images and shorter articles than the regular Time magazine.

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARS-CoV-2
SARS coronavirus 2 ( SARS-CoV-2 ) is a positive-sense , single-stranded RNA coronavirus which causes the disease COVID-19 . [2] It used to be known as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by the World Health Organization (WHO). [3] [4]
The virus started the 2019–20 coronavirus outbreak . [5] [6] [7] The first suspected cases were reported to the WHO on December 31, 2019. [8] [9] Many early cases of this new coronavirus were linked to Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, a large seafood and animal market in Wuhan , China. The virus may have come from infected animals. It is not certain that this place was the source of the pandemic . [10]
The genetic material of this virus showed many similarities to SARS-CoV (79.5%) [11] and bat coronaviruses (96%). [11] This means the virus may have originally come from bats . [12] [13] [14] Scientists did more experiments that showed the virus probably went from bats to an intermediate host , meaning another animal in between bats and humans.  The viruses in that other animal changed over time until they could infect humans.  Scientists are close to sure that the original animal was a bat but not sure what the intermediate animal was. [15] Some scientists think it could have been a pangolin because there are coronaviruses that live in pangolins even though they are not exactly the same as SARS-CoV-2 or the ones in bats. [16] Pangolins are an endangered species and buying, selling or moving them from place to place is illegal in China and many other countries.  But their scales are an ingredient in many traditional Chinese medicines , so they are often sold on the black market . [17]
Although SARS-CoV-2 began in bats, scientists noticed that the bats do not get sick and die from it.  They think this is because the bats have very careful immune systems that fight the virus without causing inflammation .  Scientists are studying bats because of this. [18] [19]
Scientists are still looking at SARS-CoV-2 infection in animals, but only a variant strain has been confirmed to spread to minks which has become a huge problem worldwide. [20] It is also inducing fear in humans as there are cases being reported of transmission of COVID-19 from minks to humans. [21] Cats, dogs and other mammals are said to at relative risk but how they can get infected is still a mystery. [22]
In early February 2020, the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses' Coronavirus Study Group gave SARS-CoV-2 its official name, for sudden acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus number two. Before that, people called the virus "2019-nCoV," for "novel (new) coronavirus that appeared in 2019." The study group chose this name because the new virus was so similar to another virus that was already called SARS-CoV with no number. [23] [24]
First, the virus enters the cell with the help of the S protein or spike protein expressed on the surface of the virus beyond its envelope. [25] The spike protein attaches to the human cell receptor hACE2 or  human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 . ACE2 is found on the cells of the epithelial cell linings of the lungs, kidneys, and intestines. [26] After the attachment of the S- protein to the virus, the S protein splits into its two components- S1 head and S2 stalk . The S1 head is now able to bind to the TMPRSS2 receptor which is a serine protease enzyme containing a transmembrane domain. The interaction of TMPRSS2 and S1 trigger the cell membrane of the human cell to merge with that of the virus leading to viral genome entry into cells via endosomes. [27] [28] The viral genome in the endosomes which convert to lysosomes is then processed by cathepsin , which is then replicated in the human cells and released after viral packaging and maturation in the cells to infect others. In October 2020, scientists said they had seen SARS-CoV-2 use another receptor, Neuropilin-1 , to enter cells with the help of the furin cleavage site in its genome which was not found in any of its previous ancestors. [27] [29] [30]
SARS-CoV-2 can infect many kinds of cells, but it mostly infects cells in the respiratory system, such as the cells of the nose, pharynx and lungs.  Because it is in cells inside the nose, it can spread via aerosol or droplets when people breathe, talk, cough or sneeze. [30]
The expanding part of the lungs, pulmonary alveoli , have two main types of cells. One cell, type I , absorbs oxygen from the air, i.e. gas exchange . The other, type II , produces surfactants , that help keep the lungs fluid, clean, infection free, etc. COVID-19 finds a way into a surfactant producing type II cell, and smothers it by reproducing COVID-19 virus within it. Each type II cell which is killed by the virus causes an extreme reaction in the lungs. Fluids, pus, and dead cell material flood the lung, causing the coronavirus pulmonary disease. [31]
Scientists looked at the lungs from people who died of COVID-19. They compared them to lungs from people who died of influenza A and to lungs from people who died but not from any problem with their lungs.  They saw the cells that made up the skins of the blood vessels in the lungs were more badly damaged in the lungs from COVID-19 patients, and there was more blood clotting.  The most important difference the scientists saw was that the lungs had begun to grow new blood vessels . [32] [33]
In February 2020, the World Health Organization announced they had chosen a name for the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2: COVID-19. "Covi" for "coronavirus," "D" for "disease," and "19" for the year 2019.  They said they did not want the name to have any person, place, or animal in it, like "Wuhan," or “pangolin,” because then people might blame the disease on that place, person, or animal.  They also wanted the name to be easy to say out loud. [2]
According to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, COVID-19 makes people feel sick in different ways, but it usually affects the lungs.  People usually cough and have difficulty breathing.  They often also have a fever, chills, headache, pain in their muscles, or trouble tasting or smelling things. [34]
According to an April 2020 study by the American Gastroenterological Association, COVID-19 can make sick people vomit or have diarrhea but this is rare.  They said about 7.7% of COVID-19 patients threw up, about 7.8% had diarrhea and about 3.6% had pain in their stomachs. [35]
A study from the University of Arizona found that SARS-CoV-2 can prevent an infected person from feeling pain.  It does this by giving off vascular endothelial growth factor-A, which binds to the human body's neuropilin receptor .  This way, sick people do not feel pain, do not know they are sick, and spread the virus more than if they could feel pain. [36]
The SARS-CoV-2 virus looks like a round ball with spikes all around it. There are four parts to the virus: the spikes, a membrane, an envelope, and the virus' genetic material, or ribonucleic acid (RNA)  Each of these four parts is a different protein molecule. The spikes, membrane, and envelope are together called the viral envelope , or outer layer, of the virus. [37] [38]
SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-strand RNA virus, meaning that it uses ribonucleic acid (RNA) to hold the patterns to make the proteins it needs instead of using DNA the way humans and other multicellular living things do. [39]
In early 2020, some people began to think that the SARS-CoV-2 may have been made on purpose in a laboratory at the Wuhan Institute of Virology and released in Wuhan like a weapon.  When the leader of Iran , Ayatollah Khamenei , said that he did not want the United States to help his country against coronavirus, he named the idea that Americans had made the virus on purpose to harm Iranains as one of his reasons: "I do not know how real this accusation is but when it exists, who in their right mind would trust you to bring them medication?" said Khamenei. [40]
One survey by Pew Research showed 29% of Americans who answered thought SARS-CoV-2 could have been made in a lab on purpose and 23% thought it could have been made in a lab by accident. [41] A survey of people in the United Kingdom showed many of them thought COVID-19 was caused by 5G wireless networks. [42]
On March 17, 2020, scientists from Columbia University and other places published a paper in Nature Medicine showing that SARS-CoV-2 was almost surely not made by humans in a laboratory.  They did this by comparing the genomes of different viruses to each other. [16] The scientists saw that SARS-CoV-2 did not match any of the viral backbones that already exist for virologists to use. [43] The paper in Nature Medicine soon became one of the most cited scientific papers of all time. [16]
There are no fixed cures for the treatment of COVID-19,  but there are various drugs that have been approved for use such as Hydroxychloroquine and Remdesivir which are detailed below. Other antiviral drugs, interferon therapy and combination of anti-viral and interferons are also being experimented on to get the best possible outcome for patients. These treatments are used to reduce the symptoms and to keep the patients comfortable. [44] [45]
In April 2020, scientists from the University of Pittsburgh said they had made a vaccine, called PittCoVacc and tested it in mice. [46] [47]
Another team of scientists led by Dr. Josef Penninger of the University of British Columbia invented a medicine called  APN01 and tested it in engineered human tissue, meaning human cells put together in a lab to look and act like they were inside a body. The scientists learned that adding human soluble recombinant angiotensin  converting  enzyme 2 (ACE2) to these tissues infected with SARS-CoV-2 made it harder for the virus to reproduce. [48] [49]
In late April 2020, a team from Oxford University announced that they had developed a COVID-19 vaccine.  The United States National Institutes of health tested it in rhesus monkeys, and it worked.  The Oxford scientists said because they had already been working on a vaccine against a different coronavirus, they had a head start working on one for SARS-CoV-2.  The scientists said they would try to test their vaccine on 6000 people by the end of May 2020, and that their vaccine could be ready for people to use in September 2020. [50] [51]
In mid-May 2020, a company called Moderna said they tested their mRNA vaccine in forty-five people and eight of them produced antibodies [52] but they did not publish the specific data or publish an article in a scientific journal. [53] Anna Durbin of Johns Hopkins University said it was too soon to tell if people would keep the antibodies long enough for the vaccine to work. [54] The United States Food and Drug Administration gave Moderna permission to test the vaccine again in more people.  Moderna's chief medical officer said the vaccine could be ready in January 2021. [52]
Some people think hydroxychloroquine , a medicine given to people with malaria, lupus, and arthritis, could work against COVID-19 and some do not.  One study from China showed that COVID-19 patients who took hydroxychloroquine got better faster, but the study was not peer reviewed .  Other studies in France and China seemed to show hydroxychloroquine helped, but the studies did not include control groups, meaning the doctors did not compare patients who took hydroxychloroquine to patients who did not, so they could not be sure it was the hydroxychloroquine that was helping them or whether it was something else. [55] In March, the United States Food and Drug Administration gave doctors permission to give hydroxychloroquine to COVID-19 patients. [56]
United States President Donald Trump suggested the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine could help cure COVID-19, but Dr. Anthony Fauci , who is part of the White House 's official coronavirus team said no one could know if hydroxychloroquine worked against SARS-CoV-2.  In early April, the New York Times reported that President Trump has "a small personal financial interest" in Sanofi, one of the companies that makes hydroxychloroquine, meaning that if the company sold more hydroxychloroquine, he would have more wealth. [56]
In early April, Fauci said, "The data are really just at best suggestive. There have been cases that show there may be an effect and there are others to show there's no effect." [57] Dr. Megan L. Ranney of Brown University said that hydroxychloroquine can cause heart attacks and other problems.  Other doctors worry that if people take hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19, there will not be enough left for people with malaria, lupus, and arthritis.  Still, some hospitals have given hydroxychloroquine to COVID-19 patients who are very sick because the doctors think it is worth the risk. [55]
Scientists in France and China performed more studies on larger groups of patients taking hydroxychloroquine.  They watched patients who were taking the medicine and other treatment together and at patients who were only taking the other treatment.  Both studies showed that hydroxychloroquine did not help and did cause side effects.  Both studies were published in May 2020. [58]
Some scientists thought the drug remdesivir, which was invented as a medicine for Ebola , could work against SARS-CoV-2.  Remdesivir works against some viruses.  Remdesivir had already been tested in humans, so the doctors already knew it would not hurt the patients even if it did not make them better.  Because scientists already knew remdesivir was safe, they were able to start testing it in humans right away. [59] [60]
In one study, doctors gave a drug called remdesivir to 61 COVID-19 patients on a compassionate basis, meaning they gave them the drug because there was no other treatment available.  Scientists studied 53 of these patients and found that 68% of the patients got better, 13% died, and 25% had serious side effects.  But because the study had no control group, meaning these patients were not compared to other COVID-19 patients who were not taking remdesivir, and because only 53 people were in the experiment, scientists must run more studies before they can be sure remdesivir works. [59] [60]
The chairman and CEO of the company that makes remdesivir, David O'Day, said that remdesivir might work better in some patients than in others and asked scientists to perform many different kinds of studies. [59] [60]
In October 2020, the National Institutes of Health told the world the results of its tests: They studied 11,000 people and found that remdesivir did not help keep COVID-19 patients alive. [61]

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_mainland_China
The COVID-19 pandemic started with a large number of unknown, possible pneumonia cases in the city of Wuhan , the capital of Hubei province, China . A Wuhan hospital told the local center for disease control and prevention (CDC) and health commissions on 27 December 2019.
On 31 December, the Wuhan CDC told the media that there was a large number of unknown pneumonia cases related to Huanan Seafood Market .
The possible disease outbreak soon became known nationwide including that of the National Health Commission (NHC) in Beijing who sent experts to Wuhan on the following day. Chinese authorities notified the World Health Organisation on this same day. [4] On 8 January, a new coronavirus was identified as the cause of the pneumonia. [5]
Public and media criticized Chinese officials for a slow response to fight the outbreak when it first started. [6] By 29 January, the virus spread to all provinces of mainland China. [7] [8] [9] All provinces of mainland China began a large public health emergency. [10] The World Health Organization declared the outbreak a " Public Health Emergency of International Concern " on 31 January, [9] saying that there are reasons that it could spread to other countries, such as those without robust healthcare systems. [11] [12] By 8 February, over 724 died from the coronavirus and 34,878 were confirmed to have been infected. In Hubei alone, there were 24,953 cases of infections and 699 related deaths. [13]
The Chinese government may have censored talks about the outbreak since the beginning of its spread. [14] [15] On 25 January, Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping warned about a "grave situation" in China. [16] [17]
The Chinese New Year celebrations were cancelled. Passengers across the country have been checked for their temperatures. [18]
By 29 January, all Hubei cities were quarantined . [19] Curfew laws were added in Huanggang , Wenzhou , [20] and other mainland cities. [21]
In February 2020, the region also saw a huge shortage of face masks and other protective gear even though China called themselves the world's largest makers of these masks. [22] Other countries donated medical supplies to help China deal with the epidemic. [23] [24] [25]
On 25 February, the number of newly confirmed cases outside mainland China passed those from within for the first time. [26] By 6 March the reported number of new cases had dropped to well fewer than 100 nationally per day, down from thousands per day.
Many human coronaviruses have their origin in bats . [27] The human coronavirus NL63 shared a common ancestor with a bat coronavirus (ARCoV.2) between 1190 and 1449 AD . [28] The human coronavirus 229E shared a common ancestor with a bat coronavirus (GhanaGrp1 Bt CoV) between 1686 and 1800 AD. [29] More recently, alpaca coronavirus and human coronavirus 229E diverged sometime before 1960. [30]
MERS-CoV emerged in humans from bats through the intermediate host of camels. [31] MERS-CoV, although related to several bat coronavirus species, appears to have diverged from these several centuries ago. [32]
The most closely related bat coronavirus and SARS-CoV diverged in 1986. [33] The ancestors of SARS-CoV first infected leaf-nose bats; later, they spread to horseshoe bats, then to Asian palm civets , and finally to humans. [34] [35]
Racism among Asians such as Chinese people grew during the pandemic such as criticisms of their markets, lifestyles and food choices. [36] [37] Some rumors say that China made the virus in a lab. [38] [39]
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_in_Canada
The COVID-19 pandemic in Canada is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID-19 ) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS-CoV-2 ).
The disease was confirmed to have reached Canada on January 27, 2020, after a man who had returned to Toronto from Wuhan , Hubei , China, tested positive. As of September 10, 2020 [update] , there have been over 134,000 confirmed cases, 118,000 recoveries and 9,000 deaths in the country. [2] The Government of Canada says that around 11,000–22,000 deaths could happen over the course of the pandemic. [3]
Most of those cases are in Canada's most populous provinces, Ontario (19,598 cases, 1,540 deaths) [4] and Quebec (36,150 cases, 2,725 deaths). [5]
Confirmed cases have been reported in all of Canada's provinces and territories, with the exception of Nunavut . An additional 13 cases involve citizens from the Grand Princess cruise ship. [6] [7] [8] [9]
Among the Canadians who contracted the virus was Sophie Grégoire Trudeau , wife of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau , who tested positive for the virus on March 12 after which the family went into self-isolation. [10] [11] By March 28, she had recovered. [12] [13]
Until March, all cases were linked to recent travel to a country with a large number of cases. The first case of community transmission in Canada was confirmed in British Columbia on March 5, [14] and Toronto's chief health officer announced on March 16 that there is "some evidence of community transmission" (that the disease was spreading within the country). [15]
In mid March, as cases of community transmission were confirmed, all of Canada's provinces and territories declared states of emergency. Provinces and territories made school and daycare shutdown, ended on gatherings, closed non-essential businesses, restrictions on entry, and mandatory self-isolation for travellers. [16]
Canada severely restricted its border access.
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Japan
The COVID-19 pandemic was first confirmed to have spread to Japan in January 2020. [2] Cases have been recorded in each of the 47 prefectures except for Iwate . The country has seen over 10,000 confirmed cases.
The Japanese government confirmed its first outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID-19 ) in the country on 16 January 2020 in a resident of Kanagawa Prefecture who had returned from Wuhan , China . A second outbreak was caused by travelers and returnees from Europe and the United States between 11 March and 23 March.
According to the National Institute of Infectious Diseases , the majority of viruses spreading in Japan derive from the European type while those of the Wuhan type have been disappearing since March. [3] [4]
The Japanese government has created many measures to stop and slow down the outbreak. On 30 January, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe created a national task force to take charge of the government's response to the pandemic. [5]
On 27 February, Abe closed down all Japanese elementary, junior high, and high schools until early April. [6]
On 7 April, Abe announced a one-month state of emergency for Tokyo and the prefectures of Kanagawa , Saitama , Chiba , Osaka , Hyogo , and Fukuoka . [7] On 16 April, the declaration was extended to the rest of the country. [8]
As the pandemic became a concern for the 2020 Summer Olympics , the Japanese government and the International Olympic Committee worked together for its postponement until 2021. [9]
Medical experts and the media have criticized the Japanese government for under-testing for COVID-19. [10] Medical experts said that the government have instead relied on the country's pneumonia surveillance to identify and treat severely-affected patients. [11]
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic , also called the coronavirus pandemic , is a current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). [1] [6] [b] The outbreak started in Wuhan , Hubei , China, in December 2019. The World Health Organization (WHO) called it a pandemic on 11 March 2020. [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses gave the virus its name. As of February 19, 2021, more than 110 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in more than 188 countries and territories. More than two million people have died of COVID-19, [12] and more than 85 million people have defeated, or recovered from the disease. [12] [13] [14]
The virus usually moves from one person to another with small drops made when coughing [15] [16] or sneezing . [17] It mostly spreads when people are close to each other, which is why social distancing is encouraged. Coronavirus can also spread when people touch a surface with the virus, and then they touch their face. [16] [17] Common symptoms include fever , cough, and trouble breathing. [18] The illness can worsen with pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome . [19] As of January 2021, a number of vaccines for COVID-19 have been developed, but only a few have been approved as safe for use. The first vaccine to be approved was created by Pfizer and BioNTech , [20] followed by the Oxford / AstraZeneca [21] vaccine. Vaccine distribution has begun in many countries in Europe, North America, South America and Asia. [22] The United Kingdom was the first western country to administer a COVID-19 vaccine. [23] No antiviral medicine for COVID-19 is available. [24] Doctors usually give patients supportive therapy instead. [25] People can avoid spreading the virus by regularly washing their hands, covering their mouth when coughing, maintaining distance from other people , staying away from crowds, wearing medical or cloth face coverings, and being alone for people who think they are infected, also known as quarantining . [24]
The outbreak might be from a coronavirus that usually lives in bats . This infected another animal, possibly a pangolin . It then changed inside that other animal until it could infect humans. [26] It originated at a wet market Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market and is linked to China’s wild animal meat trade. Live foxes , crocodiles , wolf pups, giant salamanders , snakes , rats , peacocks , porcupines , koalas and game meats were on the menu at the market. [27] A 55-year-old person from Hubei province was the first human to contract the virus on November 17, 2019. [28] A 61-year-old man who was a regular customer at the market was the first person to die from the virus on January 11, 2020. [29] The exact origin of the virus is still unknown since the market in Wuhan sold a variety of live wild animals in cages. Chinese tourists have spread the virus by traveling to other countries and made it a worldwide pandemic. [30]
Racism and xenophobia against Chinese people and Asians increased during the pandemic.
In November 2020, two companies, Pfizer and Moderna , said they had finished making COVID-19 vaccines . Both are over 90% effective. Two mRNA vaccines, one by Pfizer and one by Moderna, have been tested. Both were over 90% effective. [31] Countries began planning to give the vaccine to many people. [32] [33] [34]
The United States had the most deaths from the virus. More than 600,000 Americans died from the virus. [35] California had the most COVID-19 cases in the country. [36] Los Angeles was the most infected city.
Epidemiology is the study of how diseases affect the health and illness of groups of people.
On 31 December 2019, Chinese health authorities reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) a cluster of viral pneumonia cases of unknown cause in Wuhan , [37] [38] and an investigation was launched in early January 2020. [39]
On 9 June 2020, a Harvard University study suggested that COVID-19 may have been spreading in China as early as August 2019, based on hospital car park usage and web search trends. [40]
Cases means the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and have tested positive. [41] These cases are according to Johns Hopkins University .
Most people who contract COVID-19 recover. For those who do not, the time between the start of symptoms and death usually ranges from 6 to 41 days, but most of the time about 14 days. [42] This data are recorded by the WHO .
On 11 March 2020, the WHO said that the pandemic could be controlled. [7]
According to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, COVID-19 makes people feel sick in different ways, but it usually affects the lungs. People usually cough and have difficulty breathing. They often also have a fever , chills, headache , pain in their muscles, or trouble tasting or smelling things, [44] which can often be confused with the flu virus. [45]
According to an April 2020 study by the American Gastroenterological Association, COVID-19 can make sick people vomit or have diarrhea , but this is rare. They said about 7.7% of COVID-19 patients vomited , about 7.8% had diarrhea and about 3.6% had pain in their stomachs. [46]

In February 2020, the WHO announced a name for the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2: COVID-19. It replaced the name "2019-nCoV." [393] "Covi" is for "coronavirus," "D" for "disease," and "19" for the year 2019-- the year it was first detected. They said they did not want the name to have any person, place, or animal in it because people might blame the disease on that place, person, or animal. For example, it did not use the word "Wuhan." They also wanted the name to be easy to say out loud. [394]
According to an article in Market Watch dated on February 27, 2020, the overall case mortality rate in China was 2.3%. However, these results might be severely different between different age groups and between men and women. People over the age of 70 experienced a rate of mortality 4-5 times that of the average. Men were more likely to die than women (2.8% versus 1.7% for women) possibly due to lifestyle, such as it being more possible in men to drink and smoke, making the risk of having a respiratory illness more possible, and thus more vulnerable. [395] These numbers were the conclusion of a study by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention using 72,314 COVID-19 cases in mainland China as of Feb. 11. At that point this was the largest sample of cases for such a study. [396]
On March 5, 2020, the WHO released the case fatality rate. [397]
COVID-19 did not affect everyone in each country the same way. [398] As of May 2020, APM Research Lab said the death rate among black Americans was 2.4 times as high as for white Americans and 2.2 times as high as for Latino and Asian Americans. [399] In July 2020, The New York Times printed data from the Centers for Disease Control showing that black and Latino Americans were three times as likely to become sick and twice as likely to die as white Americans. This was not only in large cities but also in rural areas. This was not only for old people but for people in all age groups. Native Americans were also more likely than whites to become sick and die. Asian Americans were 1.3 times as likely as whites to become sick. [400]
Camara Jones, an epidemiologist who once worked for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said this was socioeconomic and not because of any natural difference in black and white people's bodies. [401] In the United States, black citizens are more likely to work jobs where they serve the public directly and to ride on public transport rather than take their own cars to work.  This makes them more likely to be infected than people who work in private offices or from home. Sharrelle Barber, an epidemiologist and biostatistician from Drexel University , also said black Americans can live in crowded neighborhoods where social distancing is harder to do and healthy food harder to find. [402] Both Barber and Jones blamed the long history of racism in the United States for these things. Three senators, Kamala Harris , Cory Booker and Elizabeth Warren said the federal government should start recording the race of COVID-19 patients so scientists could study this problem. [402]
In June, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) told the public that people using the United States' government's Medicare health program had different results depending on race. Four times as many black Medicare patients went to hospitals for COVID-19 than white Medicare patients. There were twice as many hospitalized Hispanic patients than white patients. There were three hospitalized Asian patients for every two hospitalized white patients. The head of CMS, Seema Verma, said this was mostly because of socioeconomic status. [403]
In the United Kingdom, twice as many black COVID-19 patients died as white COVID-19 patients. Other non-white people, like people from India and Bangladesh, were also more likely to die of COVID-19 than whites. Britain's Office of National Statistics said that the differences in money and education explained some of this difference but not all of it. They also said they did not know whether non-white patients caught COVID-19 more often or whether they caught more severe cases. Only female Chinese Britons were less likely to die of COVID-19 than white Britons. [404]
Native Americans in the United States have shown more deaths from COVID-19 than the rest of the U.S. [405] As of May, the Navajo Nation had 88 deaths and 2,757 cases, and the money they had been promised by the government arrived several weeks late. Only 30% of the people in the Navajo Nation have pipes with running water, which made it difficult for people to wash their hands. [406]
Scientists from Chapman University made a plan to protect the Tsimane people in Bolivia from COVID-19 and said this plan would also work for other indigenous peoples living on their own land. The scientists said that many indigenous peoples have problems that make COVID-19 more dangerous for them, like poverty, less clean water, and other lung diseases. Hospitals may be a long distance away, and racism can affect the way doctors and nurses react. But they also sometimes have things that help, like traditions of making decisions together and the ability to grow food nearby. [405] The scientists found people who spoke the Tsimane language as a first language and made teams to go to Tsimane towns to warn them about COVID-19. They also used radio stations. They said the best plan was for whole communities to decide to isolate. They found this worked well because the Tsimane already usually made their big decisions together as a community in special meetings and already had a tradition of quarantining new mothers. The Chapman scientists said their plan would also work for other indigenous peoples who also make decisions together, like the Tsimane. [407] [405] The Waswanipi Cree in Canada, the Mapoon people in Australia, and many groups in South America already tried plans like these on their own. [405] [408]
In May 2020, police officers in Minneapolis, Minnesota killed an unarmed black man called George Floyd while they were arresting him. There were weeks of protests all over the world against police brutality and racism. Experts said they were worried protesters and police could spread SARS-CoV-2 to each other. Other experts said some of the reasons that the protests were so big was because non-white people were being killed by COVID-19 more than white people were, because poor leadership in the COVID-19 crisis reminded them of poor leadership about racism, and because the lockdowns shut down workplaces and other things. This meant people had more time to protest. [408] [409] [410] [411]
African Americans are more likely to die from the virus compared to other people in the United States . [412]
Romani people (Gypsies) in Europe were hard-hit by COVID-19. [413]
In early 2020, some people began to think that the SARS-CoV-2 may have been made on purpose in a laboratory and either released by accident or on purpose like a weapon. Some Iranians thought the Americans might have made it. [414] Chinese state media said COVID-19 came from the United States to China and not the other way around. [415] Some Americans thought the Chinese might have made it. [416] Some Britons thought it might have been created by accident by 5G cell phone networks. [417]
On March 17, 2020, scientists from Columbia University and other places published a paper in Nature Medicine showing that SARS-CoV-2 was almost surely not made by humans in a laboratory. They did this by comparing the genomes of different viruses to each other. [26] The scientists saw that SARS-CoV-2 did not match any of the viral backbones that already exist for virologists to use. [418] Within a few weeks, it became one of the most cited scientific papers in history, meaning that other scientists were reading and using it.

On December 31, 2019, China alerted WHO to several cases of unusual pneumonia in Wuhan , Hubei province. [421]
On January 20, 2020, Chinese premier Li Keqiang called for efforts to stop and control the pneumonia epidemic caused by a novel coronavirus. [422] As of February 5, 2020, 24,588 cases have been confirmed, [423] [424] including in every province-level division of China . [423] A larger number of people may have been infected, but not detected (especially mild cases). [425] [426] The first local transmission of the virus outside China occurred in Vietnam between family members, [427] while the first local transmission not involving family occurred in Germany, on January 22, when a German man contracted the disease from a Chinese business visitor at a meeting. [428] As of 5 February 2020 [update] , 493 deaths have been attributed to the virus since the first confirmed death on January 9, with 990 recoveries. [429] [423] The first death outside China was reported in the Philippines, in a 44-year-old Chinese male on February 1. [430] but another source reported:
"The first cases of COVID-19 outside of China were identified on January 13 in Thailand and on January 16 in Japan". [431]
There has been testing which have showed over 6000 confirmed cases in China, [432] some of whom are healthcare workers. [433] [434]
Confirmed cases have also been reported in Thailand , South Korea , Japan , Taiwan , Macau , Hong Kong , the United States ( Everett, Washington and Chicago ), [434] Singapore , [435] Vietnam , [436] France [437] and Nepal . [438]
The World Health Organization declared that this is a Public Health Emergency of International Concern since January 30, 2020.
Bloomberg News and other business publications have reported several plant closures , travel restrictions , and imposed quarantines as a result of this outbreak. [439]
As of February 10, 2020 there have been 40,235 confirmed cases reported of people infected by the virus in China. Also reported were 909 deaths, and 319 cases in 24 other countries, including one death, according to WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus . [440]
On November 14, 2020, there were 53,853,718 global COVID-19 cases and 1,311,524 deaths with cases in 217 countries and territories. [441]
The pandemic made it more difficult for millions of people all over the world to get enough food. People lost their jobs, so they did not have money to buy food. Farms were shut down, so there was less food made. Processing plants and food factories were shut down, so less food was made ready for people to eat. [497]
In April, Arif Husain of the United Nations' World Food Program said that 130 million more people could go hungry, in addition to the 135 million who were already hungry before the pandemic began. He said that poorer countries would be more affected than rich countries because the way they move raw food from farms to cities and other places where people live is less organized and relies more on human beings than on automatic systems . [497]
This hunger crisis is different from crises in other years because it happened to the whole world at the same time. That meant that people working in other countries could not help by sending money home. [497] [498]
All over the world, children who ate meals at school had less access to food when the schools were shut down. [497]
Scientists from the University of Michigan said the pandemic was making it harder for people to find food. In a study published in May, they said out of of seven Americans over age 50 said they had trouble getting enough food before the pandemic, and it got worse when senior centers that provided meals were closed. [499] Federal and state governments started programs to bring food to older people and children. There were also more food donation drives in towns. [498]
In the United States, nursing homes had some of the highest rates of infection and death,
40% of all COVID-19 deaths in the country. Nursing homes are group homes for old people who need medical care, for disabled people who need medical care, and for people recovering from severe sickness or injury, like stroke patients.
Many people who live in nursing homes pay through the government program Medicaid, which pays less than Medicare or regular insurance companies. In June, many American nursing homes were caught throwing their regular patients out so they could make room for COVID-19 patients who could pay them more. Because nursing homes had stopped allowing visitors, it took longer for them to get caught. United States law requires nursing homes to warn patients 30 days before kicking them out, but the nursing homes did not do this.
Some of the nursing homes took the COVID-19 patients because state governments asked them to and they say they sent their elderly residents away because they were worried they would catch COVID-19 from the sick patients. [500]
Because so many governments told people to stay at home, there was less air pollution than usual for that time of year. Pollution in New York fell by 50% and the use of coal in China fell by 40%. [501] The European Space Agency showed pictures taken from a satellite of China's pollution disappearing during quarantine and coming back when everyone went back to work. [502]
The pandemic and shutdowns made people use less electricity. In the United States, people got less of their electricity from coal power but kept using gas and renewable power like wind and solar power. This was because coal plants are more expensive to run, so power companies used them less. [503]
Pollution from before the pandemic also affected what happened after people became sick. Scientists saw that more people died from COVID-19 in places with large amounts of air pollution. One team of scientists from Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg looked at air pollution information from satellites and statistics on COVID-19 deaths in Italy, France, Germany and Spain and saw that places with large amounts of nitrogen dioxide pollution had more people die from COVID-19. Nitrogen dioxide can damage the lungs. [504] [505]
The shutdowns and social distancing also affected animals. Human beings started staying at home about the same time in the spring when sea turtles like to come on land to lay their eggs. Turtle scientists in the United States and Thailand both reported more nests than usual on seashores in Florida and Phuket. They say it is because people are not coming to the beach or bringing their dogs to the beach and because there are fewer boats in the water nearby. Scientists also say they see more dugong and dolphins . [506] [507] [508] With fewer cars driving down roads, salamanders, frogs, and other amphibians were able to cross them for their spring migration. According to citizen scientists from Big Night Maine, a group that watches amphibians, four amphibians made it across the roads alive for every one amphibian killed by cars. Most years, it is only two to one. [509]
Not all ocean mammals did well. According to marine biologists in Florida, manatee deaths in April and May were 20% higher than in 2019. They say this was because many people decided to go boating because other things to do were closed. [510]
Researchers from the San Diego Zoo Global had the idea for a system that people could use to find dangerous germs before they become pandemics or even before they jump from other animals to humans. They said it was important to watch the wildlife trade, like in the Wuhan wet market. The scientists said that over the past eleven years it has gotten easier and easier to sequence viral genomes, and it does not have to be done by a large lab or by a government any more. The scientists said it would be better to spread the work out among more people. [511] [512]
Avoiding traveling and staying home will greatly reduce your risk from catching COVID-19. Staying home doesn't apply if one is sick and needs medical care. Get enough rest and stay hydrated. [513] Wearing a mask and washing your hands can prevent the virus from spreading. [514] Masks should not be placed on children under 2 years of age, people who have trouble breathing, have a respiratory or other medical condition which renders one unable to wear a mask safely, or anyone who is unable to remove the mask without help. Covering coughs and sneezes also reduce the risk of spreading the virus, but one can infect someone else by touching things with coughed/sneezed-in hands. Making sure not to share drinking glasses, cups and particularly other objects which people will drink or eat out of is important if one assumes they are infected or tested positive in the past. Washing eating utensils and other oral eating objects is preferable and cleaning surfaces or possessions which have been repeatedly touched is also important. These include, according to the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention, phones, remote controls, counters, tabletops, doorknobs, bathroom fixtures, toilets, keyboards, tablets, and bedside tables. Avoiding touching your face, nose, or mouth with your hands. Avoiding public transportation, taxis or taking rides with others can stop one's exposure to the virus. [513] Rumors spread about high doses of Vitamin C preventing COVID-19, but these as of October 14, 2020, there has been no conclusive evidence to support this idea. [515] However, there has been evidence pointing to the fact that dosing patients with Vitamin C, either through mouth or IV can reduce time on mechanical ventilators for seriously ill patients by 14%. [516] Drinking tea such as black tea and green tea can inhibit the virus. [517] Staying home for the holidays , having a small gathering of close friends and family members who are consistently taking measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and celebrating virtually through social media can prevent being infected by the virus. Airports, bus stations, train stations, public transport, gas stations, and rest stops are all places travelers can be exposed to catching the virus. [518] Eating a healthy diet that is high in fruits and vegetables, getting rest and sleep, exercising, consuming raw honey, probiotics, garlic, mushrooms and elderberry can boost the immune system. [519] Playing video games to pass time during quarantine can prevent the virus from spreading. [520] Flavanols and proanthocyanidins which are chemicals found in dark chocolate , grapes and green tea may block SARS-CoV-2 proteins. [521] Places you are most likely to catch the virus are churches, hair and nail salons, cruise ships, hospitals and the doctor’s office, restaurants and bars, theaters, sporting events, concert venues, buses, restrooms, elevators, the gym, airplanes, hotels, public swimming pools, nightclubs and the beach. [522] Vaccinated people still need to wear a mask. [523] Flying in a private jet can prevent the spread of coronavirus. [524]

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome_coronavirus_2
SARS coronavirus 2 ( SARS-CoV-2 ) is a positive-sense , single-stranded RNA coronavirus which causes the disease COVID-19 . [2] It used to be known as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by the World Health Organization (WHO). [3] [4]
The virus started the 2019–20 coronavirus outbreak . [5] [6] [7] The first suspected cases were reported to the WHO on December 31, 2019. [8] [9] Many early cases of this new coronavirus were linked to Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, a large seafood and animal market in Wuhan , China. The virus may have come from infected animals. It is not certain that this place was the source of the pandemic . [10]
The genetic material of this virus showed many similarities to SARS-CoV (79.5%) [11] and bat coronaviruses (96%). [11] This means the virus may have originally come from bats . [12] [13] [14] Scientists did more experiments that showed the virus probably went from bats to an intermediate host , meaning another animal in between bats and humans.  The viruses in that other animal changed over time until they could infect humans.  Scientists are close to sure that the original animal was a bat but not sure what the intermediate animal was. [15] Some scientists think it could have been a pangolin because there are coronaviruses that live in pangolins even though they are not exactly the same as SARS-CoV-2 or the ones in bats. [16] Pangolins are an endangered species and buying, selling or moving them from place to place is illegal in China and many other countries.  But their scales are an ingredient in many traditional Chinese medicines , so they are often sold on the black market . [17]
Although SARS-CoV-2 began in bats, scientists noticed that the bats do not get sick and die from it.  They think this is because the bats have very careful immune systems that fight the virus without causing inflammation .  Scientists are studying bats because of this. [18] [19]
Scientists are still looking at SARS-CoV-2 infection in animals, but only a variant strain has been confirmed to spread to minks which has become a huge problem worldwide. [20] It is also inducing fear in humans as there are cases being reported of transmission of COVID-19 from minks to humans. [21] Cats, dogs and other mammals are said to at relative risk but how they can get infected is still a mystery. [22]
In early February 2020, the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses' Coronavirus Study Group gave SARS-CoV-2 its official name, for sudden acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus number two. Before that, people called the virus "2019-nCoV," for "novel (new) coronavirus that appeared in 2019." The study group chose this name because the new virus was so similar to another virus that was already called SARS-CoV with no number. [23] [24]
First, the virus enters the cell with the help of the S protein or spike protein expressed on the surface of the virus beyond its envelope. [25] The spike protein attaches to the human cell receptor hACE2 or  human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 . ACE2 is found on the cells of the epithelial cell linings of the lungs, kidneys, and intestines. [26] After the attachment of the S- protein to the virus, the S protein splits into its two components- S1 head and S2 stalk . The S1 head is now able to bind to the TMPRSS2 receptor which is a serine protease enzyme containing a transmembrane domain. The interaction of TMPRSS2 and S1 trigger the cell membrane of the human cell to merge with that of the virus leading to viral genome entry into cells via endosomes. [27] [28] The viral genome in the endosomes which convert to lysosomes is then processed by cathepsin , which is then replicated in the human cells and released after viral packaging and maturation in the cells to infect others. In October 2020, scientists said they had seen SARS-CoV-2 use another receptor, Neuropilin-1 , to enter cells with the help of the furin cleavage site in its genome which was not found in any of its previous ancestors. [27] [29] [30]
SARS-CoV-2 can infect many kinds of cells, but it mostly infects cells in the respiratory system, such as the cells of the nose, pharynx and lungs.  Because it is in cells inside the nose, it can spread via aerosol or droplets when people breathe, talk, cough or sneeze. [30]
The expanding part of the lungs, pulmonary alveoli , have two main types of cells. One cell, type I , absorbs oxygen from the air, i.e. gas exchange . The other, type II , produces surfactants , that help keep the lungs fluid, clean, infection free, etc. COVID-19 finds a way into a surfactant producing type II cell, and smothers it by reproducing COVID-19 virus within it. Each type II cell which is killed by the virus causes an extreme reaction in the lungs. Fluids, pus, and dead cell material flood the lung, causing the coronavirus pulmonary disease. [31]
Scientists looked at the lungs from people who died of COVID-19. They compared them to lungs from people who died of influenza A and to lungs from people who died but not from any problem with their lungs.  They saw the cells that made up the skins of the blood vessels in the lungs were more badly damaged in the lungs from COVID-19 patients, and there was more blood clotting.  The most important difference the scientists saw was that the lungs had begun to grow new blood vessels . [32] [33]
In February 2020, the World Health Organization announced they had chosen a name for the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2: COVID-19. "Covi" for "coronavirus," "D" for "disease," and "19" for the year 2019.  They said they did not want the name to have any person, place, or animal in it, like "Wuhan," or “pangolin,” because then people might blame the disease on that place, person, or animal.  They also wanted the name to be easy to say out loud. [2]
According to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, COVID-19 makes people feel sick in different ways, but it usually affects the lungs.  People usually cough and have difficulty breathing.  They often also have a fever, chills, headache, pain in their muscles, or trouble tasting or smelling things. [34]
According to an April 2020 study by the American Gastroenterological Association, COVID-19 can make sick people vomit or have diarrhea but this is rare.  They said about 7.7% of COVID-19 patients threw up, about 7.8% had diarrhea and about 3.6% had pain in their stomachs. [35]
A study from the University of Arizona found that SARS-CoV-2 can prevent an infected person from feeling pain.  It does this by giving off vascular endothelial growth factor-A, which binds to the human body's neuropilin receptor .  This way, sick people do not feel pain, do not know they are sick, and spread the virus more than if they could feel pain. [36]
The SARS-CoV-2 virus looks like a round ball with spikes all around it. There are four parts to the virus: the spikes, a membrane, an envelope, and the virus' genetic material, or ribonucleic acid (RNA)  Each of these four parts is a different protein molecule. The spikes, membrane, and envelope are together called the viral envelope , or outer layer, of the virus. [37] [38]
SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-strand RNA virus, meaning that it uses ribonucleic acid (RNA) to hold the patterns to make the proteins it needs instead of using DNA the way humans and other multicellular living things do. [39]
In early 2020, some people began to think that the SARS-CoV-2 may have been made on purpose in a laboratory at the Wuhan Institute of Virology and released in Wuhan like a weapon.  When the leader of Iran , Ayatollah Khamenei , said that he did not want the United States to help his country against coronavirus, he named the idea that Americans had made the virus on purpose to harm Iranains as one of his reasons: "I do not know how real this accusation is but when it exists, who in their right mind would trust you to bring them medication?" said Khamenei. [40]
One survey by Pew Research showed 29% of Americans who answered thought SARS-CoV-2 could have been made in a lab on purpose and 23% thought it could have been made in a lab by accident. [41] A survey of people in the United Kingdom showed many of them thought COVID-19 was caused by 5G wireless networks. [42]
On March 17, 2020, scientists from Columbia University and other places published a paper in Nature Medicine showing that SARS-CoV-2 was almost surely not made by humans in a laboratory.  They did this by comparing the genomes of different viruses to each other. [16] The scientists saw that SARS-CoV-2 did not match any of the viral backbones that already exist for virologists to use. [43] The paper in Nature Medicine soon became one of the most cited scientific papers of all time. [16]
There are no fixed cures for the treatment of COVID-19,  but there are various drugs that have been approved for use such as Hydroxychloroquine and Remdesivir which are detailed below. Other antiviral drugs, interferon therapy and combination of anti-viral and interferons are also being experimented on to get the best possible outcome for patients. These treatments are used to reduce the symptoms and to keep the patients comfortable. [44] [45]
In April 2020, scientists from the University of Pittsburgh said they had made a vaccine, called PittCoVacc and tested it in mice. [46] [47]
Another team of scientists led by Dr. Josef Penninger of the University of British Columbia invented a medicine called  APN01 and tested it in engineered human tissue, meaning human cells put together in a lab to look and act like they were inside a body. The scientists learned that adding human soluble recombinant angiotensin  converting  enzyme 2 (ACE2) to these tissues infected with SARS-CoV-2 made it harder for the virus to reproduce. [48] [49]
In late April 2020, a team from Oxford University announced that they had developed a COVID-19 vaccine.  The United States National Institutes of health tested it in rhesus monkeys, and it worked.  The Oxford scientists said because they had already been working on a vaccine against a different coronavirus, they had a head start working on one for SARS-CoV-2.  The scientists said they would try to test their vaccine on 6000 people by the end of May 2020, and that their vaccine could be ready for people to use in September 2020. [50] [51]
In mid-May 2020, a company called Moderna said they tested their mRNA vaccine in forty-five people and eight of them produced antibodies [52] but they did not publish the specific data or publish an article in a scientific journal. [53] Anna Durbin of Johns Hopkins University said it was too soon to tell if people would keep the antibodies long enough for the vaccine to work. [54] The United States Food and Drug Administration gave Moderna permission to test the vaccine again in more people.  Moderna's chief medical officer said the vaccine could be ready in January 2021. [52]
Some people think hydroxychloroquine , a medicine given to people with malaria, lupus, and arthritis, could work against COVID-19 and some do not.  One study from China showed that COVID-19 patients who took hydroxychloroquine got better faster, but the study was not peer reviewed .  Other studies in France and China seemed to show hydroxychloroquine helped, but the studies did not include control groups, meaning the doctors did not compare patients who took hydroxychloroquine to patients who did not, so they could not be sure it was the hydroxychloroquine that was helping them or whether it was something else. [55] In March, the United States Food and Drug Administration gave doctors permission to give hydroxychloroquine to COVID-19 patients. [56]
United States President Donald Trump suggested the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine could help cure COVID-19, but Dr. Anthony Fauci , who is part of the White House 's official coronavirus team said no one could know if hydroxychloroquine worked against SARS-CoV-2.  In early April, the New York Times reported that President Trump has "a small personal financial interest" in Sanofi, one of the companies that makes hydroxychloroquine, meaning that if the company sold more hydroxychloroquine, he would have more wealth. [56]
In early April, Fauci said, "The data are really just at best suggestive. There have been cases that show there may be an effect and there are others to show there's no effect." [57] Dr. Megan L. Ranney of Brown University said that hydroxychloroquine can cause heart attacks and other problems.  Other doctors worry that if people take hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19, there will not be enough left for people with malaria, lupus, and arthritis.  Still, some hospitals have given hydroxychloroquine to COVID-19 patients who are very sick because the doctors think it is worth the risk. [55]
Scientists in France and China performed more studies on larger groups of patients taking hydroxychloroquine.  They watched patients who were taking the medicine and other treatment together and at patients who were only taking the other treatment.  Both studies showed that hydroxychloroquine did not help and did cause side effects.  Both studies were published in May 2020. [58]
Some scientists thought the drug remdesivir, which was invented as a medicine for Ebola , could work against SARS-CoV-2.  Remdesivir works against some viruses.  Remdesivir had already been tested in humans, so the doctors already knew it would not hurt the patients even if it did not make them better.  Because scientists already knew remdesivir was safe, they were able to start testing it in humans right away. [59] [60]
In one study, doctors gave a drug called remdesivir to 61 COVID-19 patients on a compassionate basis, meaning they gave them the drug because there was no other treatment available.  Scientists studied 53 of these patients and found that 68% of the patients got better, 13% died, and 25% had serious side effects.  But because the study had no control group, meaning these patients were not compared to other COVID-19 patients who were not taking remdesivir, and because only 53 people were in the experiment, scientists must run more studies before they can be sure remdesivir works. [59] [60]
The chairman and CEO of the company that makes remdesivir, David O'Day, said that remdesivir might work better in some patients than in others and asked scientists to perform many different kinds of studies. [59] [60]
In October 2020, the National Institutes of Health told the world the results of its tests: They studied 11,000 people and found that remdesivir did not help keep COVID-19 patients alive. [61]

The COVID-19 pandemic has effected the mental health of African Americans . There has been a increase in the African American suicide rate since the COVID-19 pandemic . [1] More African Americans have commit suicide than whites during the pandemic. [2]
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misinformation_related_to_the_COVID-19_pandemic
The pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 has caused a large number of conspiracy theories and misinformation about where the pandemic started, how serious it is and the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. [1] [2] [3]
According to the World Health Organization , the pandemic was also an infodemic , with misinformation spreading like disease. [2] This was because social media let information spread quickly, because celebrities sometimes repeated conspiracy theories, and because many people were locked down at home without much else to listen to.  When doctors or government officials went on television to say these conspiracy theories were wrong, that only made people think the conspiracy theories were important enough for doctors and officials to talk about. [4] One group of scientists said governments could use conspiracy theories to distract people from real problems. [5]
Fake information has been spread through social media, [6] text messages, [7] and mass media , [8] including the state media of countries such as China, [9] [10] Russia, [11] [12] Iran, [13] and Turkmenistan. [2] [14]
It has been spread by celebrities, politicians [15] [16] (including leaders in countries such as the United States, [17] [18] Iran, [19] and Brazil [20] ), and other important public figures. [21] Commercial scams have claimed to offer at-home tests and "miracle" cures. [22] [23]
Other claims include that the virus is a bio-weapon with a patented vaccine , a population control scheme, or the result of a spy operation . [24] Many theories say that there is a link between the virus and Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV). They believe that the virus escaped from the WIV by accident. [25]
One survey by Pew Research showed 29% of Americans who answered thought SARS-CoV-2 could have been made in a lab on purpose and 23% thought it could have been made in a lab by accident. [26]
In early May 2020, United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said there was "enormous evidence" that the virus was from a laboratory in Wuhan. but he said it could have been an accident.  Intelligence officials and virus scientists said it was more likely that the virus had not come from a lab. [27]
A survey of people in the United Kingdom showed many of them thought COVID-19 was caused by 5G wireless networks. [28]
When the leader of Iran , Ayatollah Khamenei , said that he did not want the United States to help his country against coronavirus, he named the idea that Americans had made the virus on purpose to harm Iranians as one of his reasons: "I do not know how real this accusation is but when it exists, who in their right mind would trust you to bring them medication?" [29]
On March 17, 2020, scientists from Columbia University and other places published a paper in Nature Medicine showing that SARS-CoV-2 was almost surely not made by humans in a laboratory.  They did this by comparing the genomes of different viruses to each other. [30] The scientists saw that SARS-CoV-2 did not match any of the viral backbones that already exist for virologists to use. [31] Within a few weeks, this became one of the most cited scientific papers in history, meaning other scientists were reading it and using its information.
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socio-economic_impact_of_the_COVID-19_pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a larger effect more than the disease itself. As the SARS-CoV-2 virus has spread around the globe, many people have begun to think about the economic effects such as the decreased business and unemployment. [1] The pandemic caused the largest global recession in history , with more than a third of the global population at the time being placed on lockdown . [2]
Supply shortages were expected to affect a number of sectors due to panic buying , increased usage of goods to during the pandemic, and people raising up prices on needed products such as masks, toilet paper, plastic gloves and hand sanitizer . [3] Reports of lack of food or groceries were said. [4] [5] [6] The pandemic also caused many social events to be pushed back such as concert delays and movie release dates. Many movie theaters are being put out of business.
There was an increase in gleaning , meaning people going to farms to pick up food plants left over on the ground after a harvest.  Because restaurants and other food businesses canceled their orders, farmers had more extra crops than usual.  People formed new organizations to find farmers with extra food, organize people to collect it, and transport it to food banks and other places where people could get to it. [7]
Global stock markets fell on 24 February 2020 due to a significant rise in the number of COVID-19 cases outside mainland China. [8] [9] By 28 February 2020, stock markets worldwide saw their largest single-week declines since the 2008 financial crisis . [10] [11] [12] Global stock markets crashed in March 2020 . [13]
It is likely that business money losses are to be in the billions and increasing. By 16 March, news reports emerged indicating that the effect on the United States economy would be worse than previously thought. [14] [15]
According to the World Data Lab, Africa's middle class is at risk because of the coronavirus pandemic.  According to one economist from the Africa and the Middle East at Standard Chartered Bank, a middle-class person is someone who is not rich but does have a steady income.  In Africa, about 170 million people are middle class and about 8 million of them could lose their businesses or become poor because of COVID-19.  This is because one of the industries that has helped Africa's middle class rise over the past 30 years is tourism, and many countries closed borders and encouraged people not to travel.  Experts say this is especially bad because a strong middle class lifts the whole country. [16]
Nigeria and other African countries are also affected by low oil prices.  Because people all over the world are driving and flying and traveling less, oil costs less.  That means oil companies make less money.  Many of them have fired some of their employees in Africa.  Then those employees do not have money to spend on local businesses. [16]
The coronavirus pandemic increased the amount of money spent through cashless payments, like credit cards and aps, over cash, meaning coins and paper bills.  The United Nations and many specific countries, such as Kenya and Sweden, encouraged people to pay for things without using cash.  Physical coins and bills can carry germs.  Credit cards and aps make it easier for people to pay for things without touching other people.  This means that the store or other seller must pay a fee to the credit card company or app company.
Experts say this may cause problems for immigrants, people with disabilities and other people who cannot easily sign up for credit cards or aps. [17]
The  pandemic has affected educational systems worldwide causing many schools and universities to close down. According to data released by UNESCO on 25 March, school and university closures due to COVID-19 were caused in 165 countries. Including localized closures, this affects over 1.5 billion students worldwide. [18] Many classes were suspended for the rest of the school year with many tacking online classes.
In the United Kingdom, some schools stayed open and taught the children of essential workers, at-risk children, and children with special education needs.  According to the Independent Provider of Special Education Advice organization, British educators unfairly sent special education students home either for no reason or by claiming that they could not wash their hands or keep a safe social distance . [19]
COVID-19 did not affect everyone in each country the same way. [20] As of May 2020, APM Research Lab said the death rate among black Americans was 2.4 times as high as for whites and 2.2 times as high as for Latino and Asian Americans. [21] In July 2020, The New York Times printed data from the Centers for Disease Control showing that black and Latino Americans were three times as likely to become sick and twice as likely to die as white Americans.  This showed some difference from place to place, but it was mostly true in both cities and the country, regardless of how old people were.  Native Americans were also more likely than whites to become sick and die.  Asian Americans were 1.3 times as likely to become sick as whites were. [22] Camara Jones, an epidemiologist who once worked for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said this was socioeconomic and not because of any natural difference in black and white people's bodies. [23] In the United States, black citizens are more likely to work jobs where they serve the public and to ride on buses and trains rather than take their own cars to work, which makes them more likely to be infected than people who work in private offices or from home. Sharrelle Barber, an epidemiologist and biostatistician from Drexel University , also said black Americans can live in crowded neighborhoods where social distancing is harder to do and healthy food harder to find. [24] Both Barber and Jones blamed the long history of racism in the United States for these things. Three senators, Kamala Harris , Cory Booker and Elizabeth Warren , said the federal government should start recording the race of COVID-19 patients so scientists could study this problem. [24]
In the United Kingdom, twice as many black COVID-19 patients died as white COVID-19 patients.  Other non-white people, like people from India and Bangledesh, were also more likely to die of COVID-19 than whites.  Britain's Office of National Statistics said that the differences in money and education explained some of this difference but not all of it.  They also said they did not know whether non-white patients caught COVID-19 more often or whether they caught more severe cases.  Only female Chinese Britons were less likely to die of COVID-19 than white Britons. [25]
Native Americans in the United States have shown more deaths from COVID-19 than the rest of the U.S. [26] As of May, the Navajo Nation had 88 deaths and 2,757 cases, and the money they had been promised by the government arrived weeks late.  Only 30% of the people in the Navajo Nation have pipes with running water, which made it difficult for people to wash their hands. [27]
Scientists from Chapman University made a plan to protect the Tsimane people in Bolivia from COVID-19 and said this plan would also work for other indigenous peoples living on their own land.  The scientists said that many indigenous peoples have problems that make COVID-19 more dangerous for them, like poverty, less clean water, and other lung diseases. Hospitals may be a long distance away, and racism can affect the way doctors and nurses react.  But they also sometimes have things that help, like traditions of making decisions together and the ability to grow food nearby. [26] The scientists found people who spoke the Tsimane language as a first language and made teams to go to Tsimane towns to warn them about COVID-19.  They also used radio stations.  They said the best strategy was for whole communities to decide to isolate.  They found this worked well because the Tsimane already usually made their big decisions together as a community in special meetings and already had a tradition of quarantining new mothers.  The Chapman scientists said their plan would also work for other indigenous peoples who also make decisions together, like the Tsimane. [26] [28] The Waswanipi Cree in Canada, the Mapoon people in Australia, and many groups in South America already tried plans like these on their own. [26]
In April 2020, police officers in Minneapolis, Minnesota in the United States killed an unarmed black man called George Floyd while they were arresting him.  There were months of protests all over the world against police racism.  Many people said that the reason the protests were so big was not only because of racism but also because COVID-19 hurt more non-white people than other people, both by making them sick and by costing them their jobs. [29]
Scholar Dr. Marcella Nunez-Smith of the Yale School of Medicine said, "They are protesting against police brutality and excessive force, no question, but they're also protesting for the ability to live their lives fully and completely, and to not have their lives cut short, either by force or preventable diseases." [30]
Job losses also meant people had more time to protest.  On The Daily Show , athlete Anquan Boldin said he thought all the cancelled sports events were also making the protests bigger and more focused: "The one thing I'm happy that is not happening right now is that sports isn't being played." He then named many tournaments and other events that had been cancelled. "...and everybody could be distracted by those things that are going on, but because you don't have sports, everybody's attention is focused on this one thing.  And I think, for us, this is the opportunity to really create change." [31]
The pandemic has had a large impact on aviation business due to Travel restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as a decrease in demand among travelers. Many reductions in passenger numbers has caused in planes flying empty between airports and the cancellation of flights.
The cruise ship business has also been affected by a decrease, with the share prices of the major cruise lines down 70-80%. [32]
On 18 March 2020, the World Health Organization issued a report about mental health and psychosocial issues during the COVID-19 outbreak. [33]
Due to doubts if pets or other livestock can pass on coronavirus to humans, [34] many people did not want to keep their pets as they were scared of getting the disease. In the Arab World , celebrities were telling people to keep and protect their pets. [35] Meanwhile, people in the U.K. bought more pets during the coronavirus lockdown to not be lonely. [36]
Many countries have reported an increase in domestic violence and intimate partner violence because of lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic. [37]
The coronavirus pandemic has been followed by a concern for a possible increase in suicides due to quarantine and social-distancing guidelines, fear, and unemployment and financial reasons. [38] [39]
Most of the time, people who work during the week sleep and wake earlier on weekdays than they do on weekends.  This is called social jetlag and it leads to poor sleep.  Scientists from the University of Basel said the lockdowns made people sleep longer and at healthier times, so there was less social jetlag.  They said this was because even people who still worked did so from home, so they did not have to get up early to travel to work. They also found that people did not sleep as well because they were worried. [40] [41]
The pandemic affected families.  In a study from Vanderbilt University, 27% of American parents said their mental health had gotten worse and 14% of parents reported their children's mental health had gotten worse.  Many families lost child care and health insurance.  Many families found it more difficult to get enough food.  Families with younger children were more affected because they were more likely to miss child care. [42]
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_stock_market_crash
The 2020 stock market crash is a global stock market crash that began on 20 February 2020 during the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic . [1] [2] [3] The Dow Jones Industrial Average , S&P 500 Index , and the NASDAQ-100 all fell into short-term decline on 27 February during one of the worst trading weeks since the financial crisis of 2007–08 . [4] [5]
Markets over the following week (2–6 March) became extremely bad, with swings of 3% or more being made per daily session (except for 6 March). [6] [7] On 9 March, all three Wall Street indices fell more than 7% and most global markets reported severe losses, due to the response of the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic and the Russia–Saudi Arabia oil price war . [8] [9]
This became known as Black Monday , and at the time was the worst drop since the Great Recession in 2008. [10] [11]
Three days after Black Monday there was another drop, Black Thursday , where stocks across Europe and North America fell more than 9%.
Stock market prices across most of the world were greater than or equal to their prices before the crash before the end of 2020. [12] [13]
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Thursday_(2020)
Black Thursday [1] was a global stock market crash on March 12, 2020 as part of the greater 2020 stock market crash . Global stock markets suffered the greatest single-day fall since the 1987 stock market crash . [2]
Following Black Monday three days earlier, Black Thursday was caused by the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic and a lack of investor confidence in United States President Donald Trump after he added a 30-day travel ban against the Schengen Area . [3]
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_recession
The coronavirus recession , also known as the Great Lockdown [1] or Great Shutdown , [2] is an ongoing major global economic recession affecting the world economy in early 2020 [3] [4] [5] during the COVID-19 pandemic . [6] [7]
The recession has caused the largest economic downturn since the Great Depression . [8] On 14 April 2020, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) reported that all of the G7 nations had already entered or were entering into what was called a "deep recession". [9] The IMF has stated that the economic decline is "far worse" than that of the Great Recession in 2009. [10] [11] [12] [13]
The pandemic has led to more than a third of the world's population being placed on lockdown to stop the spread of COVID-19 . [14] This has caused severe economic downfalls for economies across the world, [15] following soon after a global economic slowdown during 2019 that saw a lowering numbers in stock markets worldwide. [16] [17]
The United Nations (UN) predicted in April 2020 that global unemployment will wipe out 6.7 per cent of working hours globally in the second quarter of 2020—equivalent to 195 million full-time workers. [18]
The recession saw the fall of the price of oil caused by the 2020 Russia–Saudi Arabia oil price war , the collapse of the tourism industry, hospitality industry , energy industry and a large decrease in consumer activity. [19] [20] [21]
Global stock markets crashed around 20 to 30% during late February and March 2020. During the crash, global stock markets had many swings, mainly due to uncertainty in the markets. [22] [23] [24]
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_testing
COVID-19 testing can help find the SARS-CoV-2 virus. There are two types of test; one can find the virus (i.e. Polymerase chain reaction , also called PCR) and the other that can find antibodies produced in response to infection .
An accurate mortality rate of the disease and the level of herd immunity in the population can be found from the results of these tests. However, it is still not known how long immunity will last, and how effective it will be. [1]
Due to limited testing, as of March 2020, no countries had reliable data of the virus. [2]

As of 7 April 2020, the WHO had accepted two diagnostic tests under the Emergency Use Listing procedure (EUL) for use during the COVID‑19 pandemic. [11] Both in vitro diagnostics, the tests are genesig Real-Time PCR Coronavirus (COVID‑19) created by Primerdesign , and cobas SARS-CoV-2 Qualitative assay for use on the cobas® 6800/8800 Systems by Roche Molecular Systems . Approval means that these tests can also be given away by the United Nations .
In March 2020 China [12] reported problems with accuracy in their test kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDC had "flaws". [13]
80% of test kits the Czech Republic purchased from China gave wrong results. [14] [15]
A group of scientists from Hokkaido University developed an antibody test that could detect avian flu antibodies in only 20 minutes.  They said their test could be changed to detect SARS-CoV-2. [16] [17]
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_vaccine
A COVID-19 vaccine is any of the vaccines used against the Coronavirus Disease 2019 ( COVID-19 pandemic ). In July 2020, more than 150 vaccines were being developed in different laboratories. [1] Two mRNA vaccines , one by Pfizer and one by Moderna , were approved late in 2020. Both are over 90% effective. [2] A few vaccines also went into use in early 2021.
Several countries plan to give the vaccine to many people, but their plans are different. The United Kingdom plans to use its National Health Service .  Canada plans to use its military. The United States plans to send vaccine to all fifty states and then let the state governments each make their own system. [3]
The United Kingdom approved the Pfizer vaccine before the European Union or United States did. They began giving it to people on December 8. [4] The United States began giving people the vaccine on December 14, starting with health care workers in New York City . [5] By April 2021, several vaccines were in use around the world and hundreds of millions of people had been vaccinated.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect a vaccine against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative virus, to become available in less than 18 months. [6] The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) – which is organizing a US$2 billion worldwide fund for fast investment and creation of vaccine candidates [7] – indicated in April that a vaccine may be available under emergency use protocols in less than 12 months or by early 2021. [8] On 4 May 2020, the WHO organized a telethon (fundraising event broadcasted via televisions) to raise US$8 billion from forty countries to support rapid development of vaccines to prevent COVID-19 infections and deaths. [9] The United States government started Operation Warp Speed to develop a vaccine by January 2021. [1]
PittCoVacc is a vaccine invented by scientists from the University of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania in the United States . [10] It was invented to protect people from SARS-CoV-2 , the virus that causes COVID-19 . It was the first vaccine candidate, meaning vaccine that scientists thought would work well, published in a peer-reviewed study, meaning a scientific paper that other vaccine experts had read and approved before it was printed for people to read. [11] [12]
As of April 2020, it has been tested in mice but not in human beings. [10] [11] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19]
PittCoVacc is short for "Pittsburgh coronavirus vaccine." [10]
One of the head scientists, Dr. Andrea Gambotto, said they made the vaccine so quickly because they had worked on other coronaviruses before: "We had previous experience on SARS-CoV in 2003 and MERS-CoV in 2014. These two viruses, which are closely related to SARS-CoV-2, teach us that a particular protein, called a spike protein, is important for inducing immunity against the virus. We knew exactly where to fight this new virus.  That's why it's important to fund vaccine research. You never know where the next pandemic will come from."
The researchers used laboratory equipment to make pieces of the same proteins that are in SARS-CoV-2. They put the proteins inside the bodies of laboratory mice using a microneedle array , meaning a small patch with about 400 tiny needles made out of other protein and sugar. One of the scientists, Dr. Emrullah Korkmaz, said these needles melt away inside the skin after they release the vaccine.  The skin is a good place to put a vaccine because it has many immune cells in it. Then the mice made antibodies, or protective molecules, in their blood. The scientists measured the amount of antibodies and guessed it would be enough to fight off the SARS-CoV-2 virus if the mice were exposed to it.  It took about two weeks for the mice to make lots of antibodies. [10]
The scientists said it would be easy to make large amounts of vaccine and large numbers of microneedle arrays to use on people.
Another team of scientists led by Dr. Josef Penninger of the University of British Columbia invented a medicine called  APN01. They tested APN01 in engineered human tissue. This is human cells put together to act like part of the body, but it is not a whole animal or person. They added a protein called "human recombinant soluble angiotensin converting  enzyme 2" (hrsACE2) and saw that it stopped the virus from taking over cells.  They named their hrsACE2 APN01. [20] [21]
Other scientists have developed vaccines that use messenger RNA to teach the body to recognize the virus.  They say mRNA vaccines take less time to develop and make, than protein or whole-virus vaccines. [22] [23]
Messenger RNA vaccine s need to be stored at very cold temperatures.  Ordinary refrigerators are not cold enough. [24]
In mid-May 2020, a company called Moderna said they tested their mRNA vaccine in forty-five people and eight of them produced antibodies [25] but they did not publish the specific data or publish an article in a scientific journal. [26] Anna Durbin of Johns Hopkins University said it was too soon to tell if people would keep the antibodies long enough for the vaccine to work. [27] The United States Food and Drug Administration gave Moderna permission to test the vaccine again in more people. Moderna's chief medical officer said the vaccine could be ready in January 2021. [25]
The Moderna vaccine entered stage-three clinical trials on June 27, 2020.  That means it is being tested on humans.  Dr. Anthony Fauci said he did not think the vaccine would be dangerous. [28]
On November 16, Moderna said its vaccine was 94.5% effective.  The vaccine has to kept colder than freezing but it does not have to be kept as cold as the Pfizer vaccine. [2] Distribution began in February 2021. [29]
The German company BioNTech and Pfizer made a deal with the United States government to make 100 million doses of mRNA vaccine by December 2020.  The vaccine completed phase I trials and started its next trial on July 27, 2020.  Instead of being a phase II trial or a phase III trial, Pfizer's team is trying to do both phases at once.  If the companies can make the vaccine on time, the U.S. government will give them almost US$2 billion.  The vaccine is called BNT162b2. [1] BioNTech paid its employees overtime to do extra work.  They called this "Project Lightspeed" because they wanted to develop the vaccine quickly. [24] [30]
Because they wanted people to trust the virus Pfizer published the study protocols publicly.  That means they told everyone exactly how they were testing the virus.  This is information that companies usually keep secret so no one can steal their work. [24]
On November 9, 2020, Pfizer announced that BNT162 was 90% effective at preventing people from catching COVID-19.  They asked the FDA to approve the vaccine for emergency use.  The company had not yet published the results of the study in a formal scientific paper, so the FDA said they needed time to look at the results for themselves. [24]
The adenovirus is the virus that causes the common cold. [1] It does not harm the human body much.  Scientists have used the adenovirus in vaccines for many years against many diseases.  Scientists take pieces of dangerous viruses and attach them to adenovirus.  Then they inject the adenovirus into a human body.  The human immune system learns to recognize the pieces of dangerous viruses.  Then it can fight off the real dangerous viruses if the human is ever exposed to them.
In late April 2020, a team from the University of Oxford said that they had developed a COVID-19 vaccine.  The United States National Institutes of Health tested it in rhesus monkeys , and it worked.  Because they had already been working on a vaccine against a different coronavirus, they had a head start working on one for SARS-CoV-2. They would try to test their vaccine on 6000 people by the end of May 2020, and that their vaccine could be ready for people to use in September 2020. [31] [32]
The team took the spike protein from SARS-CoV-2 and put it on an adenovirus.  Then they injected that virus into test patients.  The idea is that the patients' immune systems will learn to attack the spike protein no matter what virus it is on.  This vaccine completed phase I trials and as of July 2020 is entering phase III trials.  The vaccine is called ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. [1]
The Chinese company CanSino Biologics is making a viral vector vaccine.  This vaccine uses an adenovirus that has the spike protein from SARS-CoV-2 on it.  Then the immune system learns to recognize the spike protein.  As of July 2020, this vaccine is in phase II trials, but the Chinese government gave CanSino Biologics permission to give it to people anyway.  They are allowed to give it to people in the Chinese military. [1]
The Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine is made from the Johnson & Johnson company. Unlike many vaccines, it doesn't need special, unusual refrigeration.
The company Sinovac in China and Bututan research center in Brazil worked together.  This is an inactivated virus vaccine .  This means the team took SARS-CoV-2 and changed it to make it harmless.  The patient's body learns to recognize the harmless virus and then it can recognize the harmful, wild virus too.  The company got permission to start phase III trials on July 3.  This virus is called CoronaVac. [1]
The company Sinopharm belongs to the government of China.  It is an inactivated virus vaccine. [33] This vaccine started phase III trials in the middle of July 2020. This vaccine does not have a name. [1]
The University of Melbourne and Murdoch Children's Research Institute are studying a vaccine that works against tuberculosis , the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccine.  It is a live-bacterium vaccine.  That means weak but not dead Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria are injected into the patient.  Then their immune system learns to fight it.  Over the years, scientists saw that the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccine did not only protect people from tuberculosis.  It protected them from other diseases too.  The scientists at the Murdoch Children's Research Institute and University of Melbourne are studying the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccine to see if it will protect people from COVID-19.  Because this vaccine has already been used for other diseases for more than one hundred years, doctors already knew it was safe to use.  As of July 2020, this vaccine is in phase III trials to see if it works on COVID-19. [1]
Scientists believe a vaccine that doctors spray into the patient's nose would work better than a vaccine injected into the patient's veins.  After a nasal vaccine, the body's immune cells look for the virus in the nose and mouth.  The nose and mouth are where most people are infected with SARS-CoV-2.  Scientists are not sure why this works.  As of July 2020, teams in the Netherlands, the United States, and Canada are making nasal vaccines. [34]
As of January 27th, Israel is currently the leader in percentage of people vaccinated, followed by the USA and then the United Kingdom. Israel has reportedly vaccinated about 20% of it's population, or 2 million people. [35]
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarantine
Quarantine is where animals, people or an area of land are isolated to prevent the spread of disease or pests . Countries often stop animals and plants from being brought in from elsewhere, unless they are known not to carry a disease.
The word "quarantine" comes from quarantena , the Venetian language meaning "forty days". This is because of the 40-day isolation of ships and people practiced as a measure of disease prevention related to the plague . [1] [2]
It is different from medical isolation , which is for people who have been infected with the disease.
The quarantining of people often raises questions of civil rights .  Quarantine can have bad psychological effects on the quarantined.  These include post-traumatic stress disorder , confusion and anger. [3]
Self quarantine (or self-isolation ) is a term that became popular during the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic , which spread to most countries in 2020.  Citizens were either encouraged or forced by law to stay home to lower the spread of the disease .  Some countries went into lockdowns as a form of quarantine.
As of 1 April [update] , more than 280 million people, or about 86% of the population, are under some form of lockdown in the United States , [4] 59 million people are in lockdown in South Africa , [5] and 1.3 billion people are in lockdown in India . [6] [7]
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remdesivir
Remdesivir is a broad-spectrum antiviral medication created by the biopharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences . [1] It was designed to treat Ebola .
As of 2020, remdesivir is being tested as a specific treatment for COVID-19 . It is being used for the sickest of patients during the pandemic . [2] It may shorten the time it takes to recover from the infection. [3] Treatment is given by injection into a vein . [4] [5]
On May 1, the United States Food and Drug Administration gave doctors permission to use remdesivir on patients with COVID-19.  Ordinarily, the FDA would test remdesivir first to see if it worked on patients with COVID-19, but because of the COVID-19 pandemic, they told doctors they could start using the drug before the tests were finished.
In October 2020, the National Institutes of Health told the world the results of its tests: They studied 11,000 people and found that remdesivir did not help keep COVID-19 patients alive.  Gilead and some scientists said the results of the tests might not be correct. [6]

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-isolation
In hospitals or health care areas, isolation is one of the many measures that can be taken to stop the spread of certain diseases as it would lower the amount of people being infected by it. The most recent case are people being forced by law to stay at home as schools and jobs are closed due to the 2020 coronavirus pandemic . This is different than quarantine as this is for people who have not been infected.
According to the CDC, isolation is the act of separating a sick individual with a contagious disease from healthy individuals without that contagious disease in order to protect the public from getting the contagious disease. [1]
Contagious diseases can spread to others through many forms. Four types of infectious disease transmission can happen: (1) contact transmission, which can be through direct physical contact (2) vehicular transmission, which involves contaminated objects, (3) airborne transmission , which involves spread of infectious particles through air, and (4) vector transmission, which is spread through insects or animals. [2] Since diseases can spread through many forms of transmission it is important for people who are not infected to stay at home so that they won't get sick. For those who are sick then it is important for them to quarantine to make sure they don't spread the disease.
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_by_country_and_territory
The COVID-19 pandemic , also called the coronavirus pandemic , is a current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). [1] [6] [b] The outbreak started in Wuhan , Hubei , China, in December 2019. The World Health Organization (WHO) called it a pandemic on 11 March 2020. [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses gave the virus its name. As of February 19, 2021, more than 110 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in more than 188 countries and territories. More than two million people have died of COVID-19, [12] and more than 85 million people have defeated, or recovered from the disease. [12] [13] [14]
The virus usually moves from one person to another with small drops made when coughing [15] [16] or sneezing . [17] It mostly spreads when people are close to each other, which is why social distancing is encouraged. Coronavirus can also spread when people touch a surface with the virus, and then they touch their face. [16] [17] Common symptoms include fever , cough, and trouble breathing. [18] The illness can worsen with pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome . [19] As of January 2021, a number of vaccines for COVID-19 have been developed, but only a few have been approved as safe for use. The first vaccine to be approved was created by Pfizer and BioNTech , [20] followed by the Oxford / AstraZeneca [21] vaccine. Vaccine distribution has begun in many countries in Europe, North America, South America and Asia. [22] The United Kingdom was the first western country to administer a COVID-19 vaccine. [23] No antiviral medicine for COVID-19 is available. [24] Doctors usually give patients supportive therapy instead. [25] People can avoid spreading the virus by regularly washing their hands, covering their mouth when coughing, maintaining distance from other people , staying away from crowds, wearing medical or cloth face coverings, and being alone for people who think they are infected, also known as quarantining . [24]
The outbreak might be from a coronavirus that usually lives in bats . This infected another animal, possibly a pangolin . It then changed inside that other animal until it could infect humans. [26] It originated at a wet market Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market and is linked to China’s wild animal meat trade. Live foxes , crocodiles , wolf pups, giant salamanders , snakes , rats , peacocks , porcupines , koalas and game meats were on the menu at the market. [27] A 55-year-old person from Hubei province was the first human to contract the virus on November 17, 2019. [28] A 61-year-old man who was a regular customer at the market was the first person to die from the virus on January 11, 2020. [29] The exact origin of the virus is still unknown since the market in Wuhan sold a variety of live wild animals in cages. Chinese tourists have spread the virus by traveling to other countries and made it a worldwide pandemic. [30]
Racism and xenophobia against Chinese people and Asians increased during the pandemic.
In November 2020, two companies, Pfizer and Moderna , said they had finished making COVID-19 vaccines . Both are over 90% effective. Two mRNA vaccines, one by Pfizer and one by Moderna, have been tested. Both were over 90% effective. [31] Countries began planning to give the vaccine to many people. [32] [33] [34]
The United States had the most deaths from the virus. More than 600,000 Americans died from the virus. [35] California had the most COVID-19 cases in the country. [36] Los Angeles was the most infected city.
Epidemiology is the study of how diseases affect the health and illness of groups of people.
On 31 December 2019, Chinese health authorities reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) a cluster of viral pneumonia cases of unknown cause in Wuhan , [37] [38] and an investigation was launched in early January 2020. [39]
On 9 June 2020, a Harvard University study suggested that COVID-19 may have been spreading in China as early as August 2019, based on hospital car park usage and web search trends. [40]
Cases means the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and have tested positive. [41] These cases are according to Johns Hopkins University .
Most people who contract COVID-19 recover. For those who do not, the time between the start of symptoms and death usually ranges from 6 to 41 days, but most of the time about 14 days. [42] This data are recorded by the WHO .
On 11 March 2020, the WHO said that the pandemic could be controlled. [7]
According to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, COVID-19 makes people feel sick in different ways, but it usually affects the lungs. People usually cough and have difficulty breathing. They often also have a fever , chills, headache , pain in their muscles, or trouble tasting or smelling things, [44] which can often be confused with the flu virus. [45]
According to an April 2020 study by the American Gastroenterological Association, COVID-19 can make sick people vomit or have diarrhea , but this is rare. They said about 7.7% of COVID-19 patients vomited , about 7.8% had diarrhea and about 3.6% had pain in their stomachs. [46]

In February 2020, the WHO announced a name for the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2: COVID-19. It replaced the name "2019-nCoV." [393] "Covi" is for "coronavirus," "D" for "disease," and "19" for the year 2019-- the year it was first detected. They said they did not want the name to have any person, place, or animal in it because people might blame the disease on that place, person, or animal. For example, it did not use the word "Wuhan." They also wanted the name to be easy to say out loud. [394]
According to an article in Market Watch dated on February 27, 2020, the overall case mortality rate in China was 2.3%. However, these results might be severely different between different age groups and between men and women. People over the age of 70 experienced a rate of mortality 4-5 times that of the average. Men were more likely to die than women (2.8% versus 1.7% for women) possibly due to lifestyle, such as it being more possible in men to drink and smoke, making the risk of having a respiratory illness more possible, and thus more vulnerable. [395] These numbers were the conclusion of a study by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention using 72,314 COVID-19 cases in mainland China as of Feb. 11. At that point this was the largest sample of cases for such a study. [396]
On March 5, 2020, the WHO released the case fatality rate. [397]
COVID-19 did not affect everyone in each country the same way. [398] As of May 2020, APM Research Lab said the death rate among black Americans was 2.4 times as high as for white Americans and 2.2 times as high as for Latino and Asian Americans. [399] In July 2020, The New York Times printed data from the Centers for Disease Control showing that black and Latino Americans were three times as likely to become sick and twice as likely to die as white Americans. This was not only in large cities but also in rural areas. This was not only for old people but for people in all age groups. Native Americans were also more likely than whites to become sick and die. Asian Americans were 1.3 times as likely as whites to become sick. [400]
Camara Jones, an epidemiologist who once worked for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said this was socioeconomic and not because of any natural difference in black and white people's bodies. [401] In the United States, black citizens are more likely to work jobs where they serve the public directly and to ride on public transport rather than take their own cars to work.  This makes them more likely to be infected than people who work in private offices or from home. Sharrelle Barber, an epidemiologist and biostatistician from Drexel University , also said black Americans can live in crowded neighborhoods where social distancing is harder to do and healthy food harder to find. [402] Both Barber and Jones blamed the long history of racism in the United States for these things. Three senators, Kamala Harris , Cory Booker and Elizabeth Warren said the federal government should start recording the race of COVID-19 patients so scientists could study this problem. [402]
In June, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) told the public that people using the United States' government's Medicare health program had different results depending on race. Four times as many black Medicare patients went to hospitals for COVID-19 than white Medicare patients. There were twice as many hospitalized Hispanic patients than white patients. There were three hospitalized Asian patients for every two hospitalized white patients. The head of CMS, Seema Verma, said this was mostly because of socioeconomic status. [403]
In the United Kingdom, twice as many black COVID-19 patients died as white COVID-19 patients. Other non-white people, like people from India and Bangladesh, were also more likely to die of COVID-19 than whites. Britain's Office of National Statistics said that the differences in money and education explained some of this difference but not all of it. They also said they did not know whether non-white patients caught COVID-19 more often or whether they caught more severe cases. Only female Chinese Britons were less likely to die of COVID-19 than white Britons. [404]
Native Americans in the United States have shown more deaths from COVID-19 than the rest of the U.S. [405] As of May, the Navajo Nation had 88 deaths and 2,757 cases, and the money they had been promised by the government arrived several weeks late. Only 30% of the people in the Navajo Nation have pipes with running water, which made it difficult for people to wash their hands. [406]
Scientists from Chapman University made a plan to protect the Tsimane people in Bolivia from COVID-19 and said this plan would also work for other indigenous peoples living on their own land. The scientists said that many indigenous peoples have problems that make COVID-19 more dangerous for them, like poverty, less clean water, and other lung diseases. Hospitals may be a long distance away, and racism can affect the way doctors and nurses react. But they also sometimes have things that help, like traditions of making decisions together and the ability to grow food nearby. [405] The scientists found people who spoke the Tsimane language as a first language and made teams to go to Tsimane towns to warn them about COVID-19. They also used radio stations. They said the best plan was for whole communities to decide to isolate. They found this worked well because the Tsimane already usually made their big decisions together as a community in special meetings and already had a tradition of quarantining new mothers. The Chapman scientists said their plan would also work for other indigenous peoples who also make decisions together, like the Tsimane. [407] [405] The Waswanipi Cree in Canada, the Mapoon people in Australia, and many groups in South America already tried plans like these on their own. [405] [408]
In May 2020, police officers in Minneapolis, Minnesota killed an unarmed black man called George Floyd while they were arresting him. There were weeks of protests all over the world against police brutality and racism. Experts said they were worried protesters and police could spread SARS-CoV-2 to each other. Other experts said some of the reasons that the protests were so big was because non-white people were being killed by COVID-19 more than white people were, because poor leadership in the COVID-19 crisis reminded them of poor leadership about racism, and because the lockdowns shut down workplaces and other things. This meant people had more time to protest. [408] [409] [410] [411]
African Americans are more likely to die from the virus compared to other people in the United States . [412]
Romani people (Gypsies) in Europe were hard-hit by COVID-19. [413]
In early 2020, some people began to think that the SARS-CoV-2 may have been made on purpose in a laboratory and either released by accident or on purpose like a weapon. Some Iranians thought the Americans might have made it. [414] Chinese state media said COVID-19 came from the United States to China and not the other way around. [415] Some Americans thought the Chinese might have made it. [416] Some Britons thought it might have been created by accident by 5G cell phone networks. [417]
On March 17, 2020, scientists from Columbia University and other places published a paper in Nature Medicine showing that SARS-CoV-2 was almost surely not made by humans in a laboratory. They did this by comparing the genomes of different viruses to each other. [26] The scientists saw that SARS-CoV-2 did not match any of the viral backbones that already exist for virologists to use. [418] Within a few weeks, it became one of the most cited scientific papers in history, meaning that other scientists were reading and using it.

On December 31, 2019, China alerted WHO to several cases of unusual pneumonia in Wuhan , Hubei province. [421]
On January 20, 2020, Chinese premier Li Keqiang called for efforts to stop and control the pneumonia epidemic caused by a novel coronavirus. [422] As of February 5, 2020, 24,588 cases have been confirmed, [423] [424] including in every province-level division of China . [423] A larger number of people may have been infected, but not detected (especially mild cases). [425] [426] The first local transmission of the virus outside China occurred in Vietnam between family members, [427] while the first local transmission not involving family occurred in Germany, on January 22, when a German man contracted the disease from a Chinese business visitor at a meeting. [428] As of 5 February 2020 [update] , 493 deaths have been attributed to the virus since the first confirmed death on January 9, with 990 recoveries. [429] [423] The first death outside China was reported in the Philippines, in a 44-year-old Chinese male on February 1. [430] but another source reported:
"The first cases of COVID-19 outside of China were identified on January 13 in Thailand and on January 16 in Japan". [431]
There has been testing which have showed over 6000 confirmed cases in China, [432] some of whom are healthcare workers. [433] [434]
Confirmed cases have also been reported in Thailand , South Korea , Japan , Taiwan , Macau , Hong Kong , the United States ( Everett, Washington and Chicago ), [434] Singapore , [435] Vietnam , [436] France [437] and Nepal . [438]
The World Health Organization declared that this is a Public Health Emergency of International Concern since January 30, 2020.
Bloomberg News and other business publications have reported several plant closures , travel restrictions , and imposed quarantines as a result of this outbreak. [439]
As of February 10, 2020 there have been 40,235 confirmed cases reported of people infected by the virus in China. Also reported were 909 deaths, and 319 cases in 24 other countries, including one death, according to WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus . [440]
On November 14, 2020, there were 53,853,718 global COVID-19 cases and 1,311,524 deaths with cases in 217 countries and territories. [441]
The pandemic made it more difficult for millions of people all over the world to get enough food. People lost their jobs, so they did not have money to buy food. Farms were shut down, so there was less food made. Processing plants and food factories were shut down, so less food was made ready for people to eat. [497]
In April, Arif Husain of the United Nations' World Food Program said that 130 million more people could go hungry, in addition to the 135 million who were already hungry before the pandemic began. He said that poorer countries would be more affected than rich countries because the way they move raw food from farms to cities and other places where people live is less organized and relies more on human beings than on automatic systems . [497]
This hunger crisis is different from crises in other years because it happened to the whole world at the same time. That meant that people working in other countries could not help by sending money home. [497] [498]
All over the world, children who ate meals at school had less access to food when the schools were shut down. [497]
Scientists from the University of Michigan said the pandemic was making it harder for people to find food. In a study published in May, they said out of of seven Americans over age 50 said they had trouble getting enough food before the pandemic, and it got worse when senior centers that provided meals were closed. [499] Federal and state governments started programs to bring food to older people and children. There were also more food donation drives in towns. [498]
In the United States, nursing homes had some of the highest rates of infection and death,
40% of all COVID-19 deaths in the country. Nursing homes are group homes for old people who need medical care, for disabled people who need medical care, and for people recovering from severe sickness or injury, like stroke patients.
Many people who live in nursing homes pay through the government program Medicaid, which pays less than Medicare or regular insurance companies. In June, many American nursing homes were caught throwing their regular patients out so they could make room for COVID-19 patients who could pay them more. Because nursing homes had stopped allowing visitors, it took longer for them to get caught. United States law requires nursing homes to warn patients 30 days before kicking them out, but the nursing homes did not do this.
Some of the nursing homes took the COVID-19 patients because state governments asked them to and they say they sent their elderly residents away because they were worried they would catch COVID-19 from the sick patients. [500]
Because so many governments told people to stay at home, there was less air pollution than usual for that time of year. Pollution in New York fell by 50% and the use of coal in China fell by 40%. [501] The European Space Agency showed pictures taken from a satellite of China's pollution disappearing during quarantine and coming back when everyone went back to work. [502]
The pandemic and shutdowns made people use less electricity. In the United States, people got less of their electricity from coal power but kept using gas and renewable power like wind and solar power. This was because coal plants are more expensive to run, so power companies used them less. [503]
Pollution from before the pandemic also affected what happened after people became sick. Scientists saw that more people died from COVID-19 in places with large amounts of air pollution. One team of scientists from Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg looked at air pollution information from satellites and statistics on COVID-19 deaths in Italy, France, Germany and Spain and saw that places with large amounts of nitrogen dioxide pollution had more people die from COVID-19. Nitrogen dioxide can damage the lungs. [504] [505]
The shutdowns and social distancing also affected animals. Human beings started staying at home about the same time in the spring when sea turtles like to come on land to lay their eggs. Turtle scientists in the United States and Thailand both reported more nests than usual on seashores in Florida and Phuket. They say it is because people are not coming to the beach or bringing their dogs to the beach and because there are fewer boats in the water nearby. Scientists also say they see more dugong and dolphins . [506] [507] [508] With fewer cars driving down roads, salamanders, frogs, and other amphibians were able to cross them for their spring migration. According to citizen scientists from Big Night Maine, a group that watches amphibians, four amphibians made it across the roads alive for every one amphibian killed by cars. Most years, it is only two to one. [509]
Not all ocean mammals did well. According to marine biologists in Florida, manatee deaths in April and May were 20% higher than in 2019. They say this was because many people decided to go boating because other things to do were closed. [510]
Researchers from the San Diego Zoo Global had the idea for a system that people could use to find dangerous germs before they become pandemics or even before they jump from other animals to humans. They said it was important to watch the wildlife trade, like in the Wuhan wet market. The scientists said that over the past eleven years it has gotten easier and easier to sequence viral genomes, and it does not have to be done by a large lab or by a government any more. The scientists said it would be better to spread the work out among more people. [511] [512]
Avoiding traveling and staying home will greatly reduce your risk from catching COVID-19. Staying home doesn't apply if one is sick and needs medical care. Get enough rest and stay hydrated. [513] Wearing a mask and washing your hands can prevent the virus from spreading. [514] Masks should not be placed on children under 2 years of age, people who have trouble breathing, have a respiratory or other medical condition which renders one unable to wear a mask safely, or anyone who is unable to remove the mask without help. Covering coughs and sneezes also reduce the risk of spreading the virus, but one can infect someone else by touching things with coughed/sneezed-in hands. Making sure not to share drinking glasses, cups and particularly other objects which people will drink or eat out of is important if one assumes they are infected or tested positive in the past. Washing eating utensils and other oral eating objects is preferable and cleaning surfaces or possessions which have been repeatedly touched is also important. These include, according to the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention, phones, remote controls, counters, tabletops, doorknobs, bathroom fixtures, toilets, keyboards, tablets, and bedside tables. Avoiding touching your face, nose, or mouth with your hands. Avoiding public transportation, taxis or taking rides with others can stop one's exposure to the virus. [513] Rumors spread about high doses of Vitamin C preventing COVID-19, but these as of October 14, 2020, there has been no conclusive evidence to support this idea. [515] However, there has been evidence pointing to the fact that dosing patients with Vitamin C, either through mouth or IV can reduce time on mechanical ventilators for seriously ill patients by 14%. [516] Drinking tea such as black tea and green tea can inhibit the virus. [517] Staying home for the holidays , having a small gathering of close friends and family members who are consistently taking measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and celebrating virtually through social media can prevent being infected by the virus. Airports, bus stations, train stations, public transport, gas stations, and rest stops are all places travelers can be exposed to catching the virus. [518] Eating a healthy diet that is high in fruits and vegetables, getting rest and sleep, exercising, consuming raw honey, probiotics, garlic, mushrooms and elderberry can boost the immune system. [519] Playing video games to pass time during quarantine can prevent the virus from spreading. [520] Flavanols and proanthocyanidins which are chemicals found in dark chocolate , grapes and green tea may block SARS-CoV-2 proteins. [521] Places you are most likely to catch the virus are churches, hair and nail salons, cruise ships, hospitals and the doctor’s office, restaurants and bars, theaters, sporting events, concert venues, buses, restrooms, elevators, the gym, airplanes, hotels, public swimming pools, nightclubs and the beach. [522] Vaccinated people still need to wear a mask. [523] Flying in a private jet can prevent the spread of coronavirus. [524]

229,705 confirmed cases [nb 4] and

There were large regional difference in the outbreak's severity. The outbreak in London had the highest total number and the most infections. England and Wales were the UK countries with the highest recorded death rate per head, and Northern Ireland had the lowest.

In February, the Heath Secretary , Matt Hancock , proposed the Health Protection (Coronavirus) Regulations 2020 . Hospitals set up drive-through screening (testing for the disease). The Chief Medical Officer for England, Chris Whitty , created a four-stage strategy to tackle the outbreak: contain, delay, research and mitigate (help, lessen).
First cases in the United Kingdom were on on 28 February, [4] and by 1 March there were cases in England , Wales , Scotland and Northern Ireland . [5]
The government created the Coronavirus Action Plan, and said the outbreak a "level 4 incident". [6]

Researchers suggest the lockdown could be lifted by shielding only the most vulnerable and using contact tracing . [28]

However, adults who work for disabled students' rights told Parliament that British educators had unfairly sent special education students home without good reasons. [29]

Outdoor gatherings could have up to 10 people and 10 guests were able to go to weddings. Funerals could have 20 people inside, and 30 outdoors. Up to 10 people could go into a church. [63] [64]
On 15 May, both South Australia and the ACT no longer had any active cases. [65]
On 19 May, in New South Wales, another resident of Newmarch House nursing home died from coronavirus. This brought the total number of COVID-19 related deaths at the home to 19 and the national death toll to 100. [66]
On 3 March, the Reserve Bank of Australia became the first central bank to cut interest rates in response to the outbreak. They were cut to a record low of 0.5%. [67]
On 12 March, the Government said it would spend A$ 17.6 billion to help the economy. [68] [69] It included a one-off A$750 payment to around 6.5 million people who already received income help from the government , small business assistance with 700,000 grants up to $25,000 and to pay 50% of the wages for 120,000 apprenticies or trainees for up to 9 months, 1 billion to support economically impacted sectors, regions and communities, and $700 million to increase tax write off and $3.2 billion to support short-term small and medium-sized business investment. [70]
On 19 March, the Reserve Bank again cut interest rates again to 0.25%, the lowest in Australian history. [71]
In March 2020, the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed how the virus was affecting the economy. Retail sales had increased by 0.4% in February 2020. This was probably because of increased sales at supermarkets where people were buying extra supplies in case they were put into isolation. [72] Businesses that relied on tourism lost most of their sales.
On 22 March, the government announced a second amount of A$66bn, bringing the amount to A$89bn. They doubled income support and made it easier to get the Jobseeker's allowance. They gave up to A$100,000 to small and medium-sized businesses and A$715 million to Australian airports and airlines. People were allowed to access up to A$10,000 of their superannuation in 2019–2020 and again for the next year. [43]
On 30 March, the Australian Government said they would spend $130 billion on the "JobKeeper" program. This would pay employers up to $1500 a fortnight for workers that had been in that business for over a year. The business had to have lost 30% of their turnover. For businesses who had made more than $1 billion, their turnover must have dropped by 50%. Businesses pay the Jobseeker money to their staff, instead of their usual wages. [48] This program was to deal with the enormous job losses seen one week before, when about one million Australians lost their jobs. This massive loss in jobs caused the Australian Government's myGov website to crash and lines of people waiting to enter Centrelink offices were hundreds of metres long. [73] The program was backdated to 1 March, to help re-employ the many people who had just lost their jobs in the weeks before. Businesses would receive the JobKeeper money for six months.
In the first hour of the scheme, over 8,000 businesses applied for the payments. The JobKeeper program is one of the largest economic packages in the history of Australia. [48]
Before the pandemic, 600,000 Australians worked in the arts, and added around A$3.2 billion to export revenues. The arts added about A$112 billion (6.4% of GDP ) to Australia's economy in 2016–17". [74]
In the second week of March 2020, Australian institutions began cutting back services, and many closed. [75] The Melbourne International Comedy Festival , was cancelled entirely. [76] Opera Australia close on 15 March. [77] TAll cultural institutions were forced to close on 24 March. Public gatherings were banned. Other events that were cancelled included the Sydney Writers' Festival . [78] By April over 50% of arts and recreation services were closed. [79] Adrian Collette, CEO of the Australia Council for the Arts, said the affects on the arts were “catastrophic”. [80]
The Australian movie industry has been severely impacted. At least 60 movies in production were stopped and about 20,000 people put out of work. [81] On Monday 23 March, all productions funded by Screen Australia were postponed. [82] As of 15 April 2020 [update] , after some improvement in COVID-19 statistics in Australia, Screen Australia continues to fund work and process applications, intending to use all of its 2019/20 budget. [83] Many movie production companies do not meet the rules for the Jobkeeper program and will not get any government help.
119 films and TV shows have been stopped, with only a few shows (such as MasterChef Australia and Shaun Micallef's Mad as Hell ) continuing production through the pandemic. The TV soap Neighbours was the first English-language TV drama series in the world to say they would start production again after 20 April 2020. [84]
The Australia Council will spend about A$5 million for new programs. These will be to provide immediate help to artists, arts workers and arts organisations during the COVID-19 pandemic. [85] Several state governments have also provided relief packages.
Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islanders have poorer health outcomes and a lower life expectancy than the rest of the population, particularly those living in remote areas [86] [87] Overcrowded housing and living in very remote communities, makes them very vulnerable to the virus. [88] The remote Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara (APY lands) in South Australia , restricted access to their lands in early March to protect their people from the virus. [89]
The Northern Territory developed a remote health pandemic plan [89] They set up a number of remote clinics. [90]
The major sporting leagues ( A-League , AFL , AFL Women's, and the National Rugby League ) at first said that their games would continue behind closed doors. The leagues would all later be suspended. [ source? ]
The 2020 NBL Finals, the best of five series was cancelled after the third game with the title awarded to Perth Wildcats . [110]
The remaining two One Day Internationals between Australia and New Zealand were cancelled after the first match was played behind closed doors. [111] Cricket Australia also cancelled the Australian women's cricket team's tour of South Africa. [91]
The 2020 Australian Grand Prix , which was cancelled on 13 March after McLaren withdrew when a team member tested positive for COVID-19. [112]
When the New Zealand government brought in travel restrictions, [113] the Australian Rugby League Commission (ARLC) said the New Zealand Warriors would be based in Australia. [114] The 2020 season was suspended on 23 March. [115]
The 2020 Super Rugby season was suspended on 15 March. [116]
The A-League said at first they would continue with  the Wellington Phoenix being based in Australia; [117] however, on 24 March, all matches were cancelled. [118]
The 2020 Stawell Gift has been postponed until later in the year. [119]

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Ecuador
The COVID-19 pandemic was reported to have spread to Ecuador on 29 February 2020. That was when a woman in her 70s tested positive for the virus. Ecuador was described in April as the growing "epicentre" of the pandemic in Latin America . [3]
The city of Guayaquil has had so many deaths that bodies are being left in the street. [4] Ecuador gave out cardboard coffins because the country had diffculty removing all the dead bodies. [5] [6] The government was planning to build emergency cemeteries to dispose of the bodies which are left in the streets. [7]
The number of deaths was believed to be higher than the official figure because not enough testing was being done. [8] A New York Times analysis found 7,600 more deaths had happened from 1 March to 15 April as the mortality rate spiked to three times as much as usual. That showed that the official death toll was lower than the actual death toll. [9]

The first cases of the COVID-19 pandemic in Uruguay were reported on 13 March by the Ministry of Public Health . [1]
As of March 2020 there is an ongoing outbreak in Uruguay, with the first few cases imported from Italy and Spain .
The majority of early cases were caused by a wedding with 500 people in Montevideo . It was attended by a Uruguayan returning from Spain who later tested positive. [2]
On 14 March, it was announced that the two patients who took the bus ride on 8 March caused some 200 contacts, who were seen as suspected cases with home quarantine recommended. [3] [4]

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Venezuela
As part of an ongoing worldwide pandemic ,  the first two patients with COVID-19 in Venezuela were confirmed on 13 March 2020; [2] [3] the first death was reported on 26 March. [4]
However, the first record of a patient claiming to have symptoms of coronavirus disease dates back to 29 February 2020, [5] with government officials suspecting that the first person carrying the virus could have entered the country as early as 25 February. [6]
Venezuela is particularly vulnerable to the pandemic because of its ongoing socioeconomic and political crisis causing massive shortages of food and basic necessities, including medical supplies.
The mass emigration of Venezuelan doctors has also caused chronic staff shortages in hospitals.
To prevent the spread of the disease into Venezuela, the governments of Brazil and Colombia temporarily closed their borders with Venezuela.
Stay-at-home orders were announced on 15 March, when the country registered another seven cases, and introduced the next day across six states and the Caracas area. [7]
It was on the first day of the quarantine across six states, 16 March, that Argentina's ambassador in Venezuela, Eduardo Porretti, tested positive for the virus, [8] and Nicolás Maduro announced that sixteen new cases were confirmed, bringing the total to 33. Maduro extended the quarantine to the entire country. [9]

Antarctica was the last continent to have confirmed cases of COVID-19 and was one of the last regions of the world affected by the pandemic. [1] [2] [3]
The first cases were reported in December 2020, almost a year after the first cases of COVID-19 were seen in China. [4]
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus
Coronaviruses are a group of RNA viruses . [5] [6] They cause diseases in birds and mammals , including humans . These diseases can be mild, or they can be fatal. In humans and birds, they cause respiratory tract infections. Mild illnesses in humans include some cases of the common cold (which is also caused by other viruses, for example rhinoviruses ). More lethal varieties can cause SARS , MERS , and COVID-19 .
They are enveloped viruses with a positive-sense RNA genome . [7] The genome size of coronaviruses is about 26 to 32 kilobases, [8] which is extraordinarily large for an RNA virus . There are four major groups of coronaviruses, called alpha, beta, gamma and delta.
The most famous coronavirus is one of the betas, the kind that causes Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in humans.
The name "coronavirus" comes from the Latin word corona , meaning "crown" or "halo", and refers to how virions look under an electron microscopy (E.M.). [9] They have a fringe of large, bulbous surface projections looking like a crown. This morphology is created by the viral spike (S) peplomers , which are proteins on the surface of the virus. They decide which cells the virus can infect.
Proteins of coronaviruses are the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N).
Coronaviruses infect the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts of mammals and birds . Six different strains of coronaviruses infect humans. These include:
Coronaviruses are believed to cause many common colds in human adults. The significance and economic impact of coronaviruses is hard to assess. Unlike rhinoviruses (another common cold virus), human coronaviruses are easy to grow in the laboratory .
Coronaviruses are large, spherical particles with unique surface projections. [10] Their size is variable, averageing 80 to 120 nms [11] The total molecular weight is on average 40,000 kDa . They are enclosed in an envelope studded with projecting protein molecules. [12] These layers protect the virus when it is outside the host cell. [13]
The viral envelope is made up of a lipid bilayer in which the membrane (M), envelope (E) and spike (S) structural proteins are anchored. [14] The ratio of E:S:M in the lipid bilayer is approximately 1:20:300. [15] The E and M protein are the structural proteins that combined with the lipid bilayer to shape the viral envelope and maintain its size. S proteins are needed for interaction with the host cells. But human coronavirus NL63 is peculiar in that its M protein has the binding site for the host cell, and not its S protein. [16] The diameter of the envelope is 85 nm.
The earliest reports of a coronavirus infection in animals occurred in the late 1920s, when an acute respiratory infection of domesticated chickens happened in North America. [17] Arthur Schalk and M.C. Hawn in 1931 made the first detailed report which described a new respiratory infection of chickens in North Dakota .  It was not realized at the time that three related viruses were involved. [18]
Human coronaviruses were discovered in the 1960s using two different methods. [19] [20] [21] E.C. Kendall, Malcolm Bynoe, and David Tyrrel, working at the Common Cold Unit of the British Medical Research Council collected a unique common cold virus B814 in 1961. [22] [23] [24] The virus could not be cultivated using the techniques which had successfully cultivated rhinoviruses , adenoviruses and other known common cold viruses. Eventually this was solved. [25] The new cultivating method was introduced to the lab by Bertil Hoorn. [26] The isolated virus when put into the noses of volunteers caused a cold. the virus was inactivated by ether which showed it had a lipid envelope . [22] [27] [28] The novel virus caused a cold in volunteers and, like B814, was inactivated by ether. [29]
Scottish virologist June Almeida at St Thomas' Hospital , London, compared the structures of IBV, B814 and 229E in 1967. [30] [31] Using transmission electron microscopy the three viruses were shown to be similar in shape and have club-like spikes . [32] A research group at the National Institute of Health the same year isolated another member of this group of viruses. [33] Like B814, 229E, and IBV, the novel cold virus OC43 had distinctive club-like spikes when observed with the electron microscope. [34] [35]
The IBV-like novel cold viruses looked like the mouse hepatitis virus. This new group of viruses were called "coronaviruses" from their crown-like appearance. [36] [37] The coronavirus strain B814 was lost. It is not known which present human coronavirus it was. [38] Other human coronaviruses have since been identified, including SARS-CoV in 2003, HCoV NL63 in 2003, HCoV HKU1 in 2004, MERS-CoV in 2013, and SARS-CoV-2 in 2019. [39] There have been a large number of animal coronaviruses identified since the 1960s.
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan
Wuhan ( Chinese : 武汉 ) is the capital of Hubei province, People's Republic of China , and is the city with most people in Central China. [1] It is at the east of the Jianghan Plain , where the Yangtze and Han rivers meet. Joining three nearby cities, Wuchang , Hankou , and Hanyang , Wuhan is a center of transportation, with many railways, roads and expressways passing through. Because of its important role in transportation, Wuhan was sometimes called the " Chicago of China." [2] [3] It is also recognized as the political, economic, financial, cultural, and educational center of central China. [1]
The city of Wuhan, first called so in 1927, has 10,020,000 people (as at 2011). [4] In the 1920s, Wuhan was the national capital of a Kuomintang (KMT) government led by Wang Jingwei when he was against Chiang Kai-shek , [5] and it was also the capital in 1937. [6] [7]
In December 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic started in Wuhan.
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019
Coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID-19 ) is an infectious disease caused by SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) , [8] a virus closely related to the SARS virus . [9] [10] [11]
The disease is the cause of the COVID-19 pandemic . [12] [13] Those who get the disease might get a fever , dry cough , fatigue (tiredness) and shortness of breath. A sore throat, runny nose or sneezing is less common. In very bad cases, they can even get a much worse fever, fewer white blood cells , and loss of appetite. They might cough up blood, and have kidney failure .
People with this disease can get pneumonia and multi-organ failure if they are weak, old, or are already sick. [12] [13] There are people who are called asymptomatic carriers , which means that they did not have all or some of the symptoms of the virus. This is very dangerous since they may not know that they have the virus and can give it to other people without knowing it.
The countries with the most sick people are the USA, India and Brazil. COVID-19 virus travels from person to person through the air like the common cold does. Scientists think the virus is not able to hang in the air a long time and go far like the measles virus does. [14]
According to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, COVID-19 makes people feel sick in different ways, but it usually affects the lungs.  People usually cough and have difficulty breathing.  They often also have a fever, chills, headache, pain in their muscles, or trouble tasting or smelling things. [16]
According to an April 2020 study by the American Gastroenterological Association, COVID-19 can make sick people vomit or have diarrhea but this is rare.  They said about 7.7% of COVID-19 patients threw up, about 7.8% had diarrhea and about 3.6% had pain in their stomachs. [17]
In February 2020, the World Health Organization announced they had chosen a name for the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2: COVID-19, replacing the temporary name "2019-nCoV." [18] "Co" is for "corona," "Vi" for "virus," and "D" for "disease," and "19" for the year 2019. They said they did not want the name to have any person, place, or animal in it, like "Wuhan," because then people might blame the disease on that place, person, or animal. They also wanted the name to be easy to say out loud. [19]
The expanding part of the lungs, pulmonary alveoli , have two main types of cells. One cell, type I , absorbs from the air, i.e. gas exchange . The other, type II , produces surfactants , which help keep the lungs fluid, clean, infection free, etc. COVID-19 finds a way into a surfactant producing type II cell, and smothers it by reproducing COVID-19 virus within it. Each type II cell which is killed by the virus causes an extreme reaction in the lungs. Fluids, pus, and dead cell material flood the lung, causing the coronavirus pulmonary disease. [20]
Scientists looked at the lungs from people who died of COVID-19. They compared them to lungs from people who died of influenza A and to lungs from people who died but not from any problem with their lungs.  They saw the cells that made up the skins of the blood vessels in the lungs were more badly damaged in the lungs from COVID-19 patients, and there was more blood clotting.  The most important difference the scientists saw was that the lungs had begun to grow new blood vessels . [21] [22]
According to doctors and scientists from Columbia University , the virus damages the inside of the blood vessels, which causes blood clotting.  The blood clots travel through the body and can damage the heart, kidneys and other systems.  The virus can also damage organs by itself.  In New York City hospitals, 50% of COVID-19 patients had kidney failure in some way.  The scientists said that the kidneys have many ACE2 receptors, the same receptor that SARS-CoV-2 uses to sneak into cells. [23] [24]
Some scientists, for example Robert Stevens of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, are starting studies to watch people who have recovered from COVID-19 to see what long-term effects they have.  Scientists think that people who have COVID-19 and do not die might still have lung or brain damage for the rest of their lives. [25]
Other scientists saw that SARS-CoV-2 made the body make less of the male hormone testosterone and considered that SARS-CoV-2 could cause sterility the way the mumps and other viruses do.  A sterile man cannot father children naturally. [26] [27]
Scientists saw that more people died from COVID-19 in places with large amounts of air pollution .  One team of scientists from Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg looked at air pollution information from satellites and statistics on COVID-19 deaths in Italy, France, Germany and Spain and saw that places with large amounts of nitrogen dioxide pollution had more people die from COVID-19.  Nitrogen dioxide can damage the lungs. [28] [29]
There are many ways to stop the spread of COVID-19. Washing hands for 20 seconds or more will help kill the viruses. [30] [31] [32] Try not to touch your own face - eyes, nose, or mouth - with unwashed hands. [30] [31] [32]
People should stay away from crowded places if they can, because being close to big groups of people can easily spread the virus. [30] [31] [32] In fact, many health organizations say that people should stay at least two metres from another person. [a]
Many people wear face masks in public to stop getting the virus, and it is recommended by countries such as China, [35] Hong Kong [36] and Thailand . [37] Most face masks work best to stop you giving the virus to other people. When people with the virus wear masks they give it to less people. One study published in Cell showed that wearing a mask pulled down to cover the mouth but not the nose was not good.  People usually breathe through their noses and not their mouths.  Scientists found that nose cells were more likely to have virus in them than throat cells.  Because of this, the scientists said, breathing out through the nose was more likely to spread the virus than breathing out through the mouth, so people should wear masks that cover their noses. [38]
One study in China found the virus in semen from men with COVID-19.  The scientists wondered if men could give COVID-19 to partners in sexual intercourse . [27]
Experts recommend testing people for COVID-19.  Some people may have SARS-CoV-2 in their bodies but not feel sick right away.  These people can spread the virus to others.
There are two types of tests.  Viral tests show whether a person has the virus right then.  Antibody tests show whether the person had the virus and has since recovered. [39]
A group of scientists from Hokkaido University developed an antibody test that could detect avian flu antibodies in only 20 minutes.  They said their test could be changed to detect SARS-CoV-2. [40] [41]
The virus that causes COVID-19 is new to humans. This means that there are no medicines that can stop people from getting COVID-19 or that can treat them if they do get it. Scientists are working hard to invent and test new medicines. Some scientists are trying to invent a new vaccine which would stop people from getting sick with COVID-19. Other scientists are testing medicines used for other diseases to see if those medicines make people get less sick if they do get COVID-19.
In April 2020, the group Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) said that scientists were looking at 115 compounds that could be a vaccine. [42] Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, says it takes 18 months to test a vaccine to make sure it works and is safe. [43]
In April 2020, scientists from the University of Pittsburgh said they had made a vaccine, called PittCoVacc , and tested it in mice. [44] [45]
Another team of scientists led by Dr. Josef Penninger of the University of British Columbia invented a medicine called  APN01. They tested APN01 in engineered human tissue. This is human cells put together to act like part of the body, but it is not a whole animal or person. They added a protein called "human recombinant soluble angiotensin converting  enzyme 2" (hrsACE2) and saw that it stopped the virus from taking over cells.  They named their hrsACE2 APN01. [46] [47]
In late April 2020, a team from Oxford University said that they had developed a COVID-19 vaccine.  The United States National Institutes of Health tested it in rhesus monkeys , and it worked.  Because they had already been working on a vaccine against a different coronavirus, they had a head start working on one for SARS-CoV-2. They would try to test their vaccine on 6000 people by the end of May 2020, and that their vaccine could be ready for people to use in September 2020. [51] [52]
In November 2020, two companies, Pfizer and Moderna both said their vaccines had completed some testing.  Both were over 90% effective.  Both companies asked the United States Food and Drug Administration for permission to start giving the vaccine to people. [53] Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are messenger RNA vaccines they teach the body to recognize the virus.  They say mRNA vaccines take less time to develop and make than protein or whole-virus vaccines. [54] [55]
A 90 year old woman from Northern Ireland was the first to receive the Pfizer vaccine on December 8, 2020.
A study from a British company called Synairgen showed that some patients with mild COVID-19 who took interferon beta were less likely to develop severe COVID-19, and they got better faster.  The doctors gave the patients interferon beta by letting them breathe in a spray. [56] [57] The study was performed on 101 patients, [57] which is not many. [56] The scientists gave some patients interferon beta and other patients a placebo , a harmless but empty spray.  The COVID-19 patients who received the real medicine were 79% less likely to develop a severe case. [57] As of July 2020, scientists are planning to test inhaled interferon beta in a larger study with 400 patients to see if it really does help. [56]
Unlike hydroxychloroquine, interferon beta is a common drug. [56] Giving interferon beta to COVID-19 patients would not mean taking medicine away from people with malaria or lupus.
Some people thought hydroxychloroquine , a medicine given to people with malaria , lupus , and arthritis , might work against COVID-19.  One study from China showed that COVID-19 patients who took hydroxychloroquine got better faster, but the study was not peer reviewed .  Other studies in France and China seemed to show hydroxychloroquine helped, but the doctors did not compare patients who took hydroxychloroquine to patients who did not, so they could not be sure it was the hydroxychloroquine that was helping them or whether it was something else. [58] United States President Donald Trump said he was taking hydroxychloroquine and told other people to take it too, but Dr. Anthony Fauci , part of the White House official coronavirus task force, said no one could know for sure if hydroxychloroquine worked against SARS-CoV-2. [59] [60] In March, the United States Food and Drug Administration allowed doctors to give hydroxychloroquine and another drug called chloroquine to COVID-19 patients, [59] but in June, they told doctors to stop.  By then, more studies had shown that the drugs did not help much and could harm the patients' hearts. [58] [61]
Some scientists also think the drug remdesivir, which was invented as a medicine for Ebola , could work against SARS-CoV-2.  Remdesivir works against other viruses and it has already been tested in humans, so the doctors already knew it would not hurt the patients even if it did not make them better.  Because scientists already knew remdesivir was safe, they were able to start testing it in humans right away. [62] [63]
Doctors gave remdesivir to some COVID-19 patients on a compassionate basis, meaning they gave them the drug because there was no other treatment available.  68% of the patients got better, 13% died, and 25% had serious side effects.  But because the study had no control group, meaning these patients were not compared to other COVID-19 patients who were not taking remdesivir, and because only 53 people were in the experiment, scientists must run more studies before they can be sure remdesivir works. [62] [63]
The chairman and CEO of the company that makes remdesivir, David O'Day, said that remdesivir might work better in some patients than in others and asked scientists to perform many different kinds of studies. [62] [63] On July 3, the European Commission approved remdesivir for use in the very sickest COVID-19 patients. [64]
Gilead Sciences, which makes remdesivir, charges about US$ 2,340 per patient, and it agreed to send most of its remdesivir to the United States.  In July 2020, the Drug Controller General of India approved the third of three generic version of remdesivir made by Indian companies.  The cheapest of them costs 4800 rupees per vial, or US$64.31. [64]
Some scientists gave SARS and MERS to llamas so the llamas' immune systems would make antibodies , or natural medicines, against those viruses, and they found a few antibodies that worked.  In a May 2020 study, the scientists said this could work with SARS-CoV-2 too. [65] [66]
Staying home will reduce your chances of catching coronavirus disease 2019. Wearing a mask, staying 2 meters (6 feet) away from people, washing your hands, using disinfectants and avoiding large crowds will prevent COVID-19. [67] Eating a healthy diet can help you physically and emotionally. [68]
The effectiveness of the mask depends on what type of mask it is. While masks like surgical masks are effective, others like a neck gator are not. [69]
COVID-19 vaccines such as Moderna and Pfizer will reduce your chances of catching the deadly virus. Getting vaccinated is 90% effective. People who are vaccinated have a far lower chance of being hospitalized. The single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine was found to be 66% effective at preventing COVID-19 2 weeks after vaccination. [70] The Pfizer vaccine can prevent deadlier variants of the virus. [71]
Consuming green tea and turmeric can prevent the virus. [72]
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019
Coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID-19 ) is an infectious disease caused by SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) , [8] a virus closely related to the SARS virus . [9] [10] [11]
The disease is the cause of the COVID-19 pandemic . [12] [13] Those who get the disease might get a fever , dry cough , fatigue (tiredness) and shortness of breath. A sore throat, runny nose or sneezing is less common. In very bad cases, they can even get a much worse fever, fewer white blood cells , and loss of appetite. They might cough up blood, and have kidney failure .
People with this disease can get pneumonia and multi-organ failure if they are weak, old, or are already sick. [12] [13] There are people who are called asymptomatic carriers , which means that they did not have all or some of the symptoms of the virus. This is very dangerous since they may not know that they have the virus and can give it to other people without knowing it.
The countries with the most sick people are the USA, India and Brazil. COVID-19 virus travels from person to person through the air like the common cold does. Scientists think the virus is not able to hang in the air a long time and go far like the measles virus does. [14]
According to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, COVID-19 makes people feel sick in different ways, but it usually affects the lungs.  People usually cough and have difficulty breathing.  They often also have a fever, chills, headache, pain in their muscles, or trouble tasting or smelling things. [16]
According to an April 2020 study by the American Gastroenterological Association, COVID-19 can make sick people vomit or have diarrhea but this is rare.  They said about 7.7% of COVID-19 patients threw up, about 7.8% had diarrhea and about 3.6% had pain in their stomachs. [17]
In February 2020, the World Health Organization announced they had chosen a name for the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2: COVID-19, replacing the temporary name "2019-nCoV."
