In 2020 and 2021, an ongoing outbreak of Avian influenza subtype H5N8 has been happening in poultry farms and in wild bird populations in several countries and continents. It has caused the cullings of millions of birds to prevent a pandemic similar to that of the H5N1 outbreak in 2008 . The first case of human transmission was reported by Russian authorities in February 2021, as several poultry farm workers tested positive for the virus. 	In 2020 and 2021, an ongoing outbreak of Avian influenza subtype H5N8 has been occurring at poultry farms and among wild bird populations in several countries and continents, leading to the subsequent cullings of millions of birds to prevent a pandemic similar to that of the H5N1 outbreak in 2008 . The first case of human transmission was reported by Russian authorities in February 2021, as several poultry farm workers tested positive for the virus. On 4 February 2020, Saudi Arabian government reported an outbreak of the highly pathogenic H5N8 virus on a poultry farm. The outbreak, which occurred in the central Sudair region, killed more than 22,000 birds in a few weeks.  In the summer months, H5N8 was detected in wild birds in western Russia and Kazakhstan , because this included waterbirds that migrate into northern and western Europe, it was considered likely that the virus would be detected there later in the year . 	4.705206
Gastrointestinal bleeding , also known as gastrointestinal hemorrhage , is all forms of bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract , from the mouth to the rectum .  When there is significant blood loss over a short time, symptoms may include vomiting red blood , vomiting black blood , bloody stool , or black stool . Small amounts of bleeding over a long time may cause iron-deficiency anemia resulting in feeling tired or heart-related chest pain . Other symptoms may include abdominal pain , shortness of breath , pale skin , or passing out . Sometimes in those with small amounts of bleeding no symptoms may be present.

Small amounts of bleeding over a long time may cause iron-deficiency anemia resulting in feeling tired or heart-related chest pain .  Other symptoms may include abdominal pain , shortness of breath , pale skin , or passing out .   Sometimes in those with small amounts of bleeding no symptoms may be present.  Bleeding is typically divided into two main types: upper gastrointestinal bleeding and lower gastrointestinal bleeding .  Causes of upper GI bleeds include: peptic ulcer disease, esophageal varices due to liver cirrhosis and cancer , among others.  Causes of lower GI bleeds include: hemorrhoids , cancer, and inflammatory bowel disease among others.  Diagnosis typically begins with a medical history and physical examination , along with blood tests.  Small amounts of bleeding may be detected by fecal occult blood test.  Endoscopy of the lower and upper gastrointestinal tract may locate the area of bleeding.  Medical imaging may be useful in cases that are not clear.  Initial treatment focuses on resuscitation which may include intravenous fluids and blood transfusions .  Often blood transfusions are not recommended unless the hemoglobin is less than 70 or 80 g/L.   Treatment with proton pump inhibitors , octreotide , and antibiotics may be considered in certain cases.    If other measures are not effective, an esophageal balloon may be attempted in those with presumed esophageal varices.  Endoscopy of the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum or endoscopy of the large bowel are generally recommended within 24 hours and may allow treatment as well as diagnosis. 	4.7024755
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia  is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes too many lymphocytes .   Early on there are typically no symptoms.  Later non-painful lymph node swelling, feeling tired, fever , night sweats , or weight loss for no clear reason may occur.  Risk factors include having a family history of the disease.	Chronic lymphocytic leukemia  is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes too many lymphocytes .   Early on there are typically no symptoms.  Later non-painful lymph node swelling, feeling tired, fever , night sweats , or weight loss for no clear reason may occur.   Enlargement of the spleen and low red blood cells  may also occur.   It typically worsens gradually over years.  Risk factors include having a family history of the disease.  Exposure to Agent Orange and certain insecticides might also be a risk.  CLL results in the buildup of B cell lymphocytes in the bone marrow, lymph nodes, and blood .  These cells do not function well and crowd out healthy blood cells .  CLL is divided into two main types: those with a mutated IGHV gene and those without.  Diagnosis is typically based on blood tests finding high numbers of mature lymphocytes and smudge cells.  Early-stage CLL in asymptomatic cases responds better to careful observation, as there is no evidence that early intervention treatment can alter the course of the disease.  Immune defects occur early in the course of CLL and these increase the risk of developing serious infection, which should be treated appropriately with antibiotics.  In those with significant symptoms, chemotherapy or immunotherapy may be used.  As of 2019 ibrutinib is often the initial medication recommended.  The medications fludarabine , cyclophosphamide , and rituximab were previously the initial treatment in those who are otherwise healthy. 	4.6801105
Cysticercosis is a tissue infection caused by the young form of the pork tapeworm .   People may have few or no symptoms for years. In some cases, particularly in Asia, solid lumps of between one and two centimetres may develop under the skin.  After months or years these lumps can become painful and swollen and then be cured. 	Cysticercosis is a tissue infection caused by the young form of the pork tapeworm .   People may have few or no symptoms for years.   In some cases, particularly in Asia, solid lumps of between one and two centimetres may develop under the skin.  After months or years these lumps can become painful and swollen and then resolve.   A specific form called neurocysticercosis , which affects the brain , can cause neurological symptoms.  In developing countries this is one of the most common causes of seizures .  Cysticercosis is usually acquired by eating food or drinking water contaminated by tapeworm eggs from human feces .  Among foods, uncooked vegetables are the major source.  The tapeworm eggs are present in the feces of a person infected with the adult worms, a condition known as taeniasis .   Taeniasis, in the strict sense, is a different disease and is due to eating cysts in poorly cooked pork.  People who live with someone with the pork tapeworm have a greater risk of getting cysticercosis.  The diagnosis can be made by aspiration of a cyst.  Taking pictures of the brain with computer tomography  or magnetic resonance imaging  are most useful for the diagnosis of disease in the brain.  An increased number of a type of white blood cell , called eosinophils , in the cerebral spinal fluid and blood is also an indicator.  Infection can be effectively prevented by personal hygiene and sanitation :  this includes cooking pork well, proper toilets and sanitary practices, and improved access to clean water.  Treating those with taeniasis is important to prevent spread.  Treating the disease when it does not involve the nervous system may not be required.  Treatment of those with neurocysticercosis may be with the medications praziquantel or albendazole .  These may be required for long periods.  Steroids , for anti-inflammation during treatment, and anti-seizure medications may also be required.  Surgery is sometimes done to remove the cysts. 	4.65688
Gastrointestinal cancer refers to malignant conditions of the gastrointestinal tract  and accessory organs of digestion , including the esophagus , stomach , biliary system , pancreas , small intestine , large intestine , rectum and anus . The symptoms relate to the organ affected and can include obstruction , abnormal bleeding or other associated problems. The diagnosis often requires endoscopy , followed by biopsy of suspicious tissue. The treatment depends on the location of the tumor, as well as the type of cancer cell and whether it has invaded other tissues or spread elsewhere. These factors also determine the prognosis.

The treatment depends on the location of the tumor, as well as the type of cancer cell and whether it has invaded other tissues or spread elsewhere. These factors also determine the prognosis. Overall, the GI tract and the accessory organs of digestion  are responsible for more cancers and more deaths from cancer than any other system in the body.   There is significant geographic variation in the rates of different gastrointestinal cancers.  Esophageal cancer is the sixth-most-common cancer in the world, and its incidence is increasing.  Some three to five males are affected for each female.  An "esophageal cancer belt", in which the incidence of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma  is more than a hundred times that of adjacent areas, extends from northeastern China through central Asia to northern Iran.  Ethiopia also has a notably high incidence.  There are two main types of esophageal cancer—adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. Worldwide, the incidence of each type is about the same, but in developed countries like North America and Europe adenocarcinoma is the more common. 	4.6344376
Clostridioides difficile infection , also known as Clostridium difficile infection , is a symptomatic infection caused by the spore -forming bacterium Clostridioides difficile .  Symptoms include watery diarrhea , fever, nausea, and abdominal pain . It makes up about 20% of cases of antibiotic-associated diarrhea . Problems caused by this infection are pseudomembranous colitis , toxic megacolon , perforation of the colon , and sepsis . Clostridioides difficile infection is spread by bacterial spores found within feces .	Clostridioides difficile infection , also known as Clostridium difficile infection , is a symptomatic infection due to the spore -forming bacterium Clostridioides difficile .   Symptoms include watery diarrhea , fever, nausea, and abdominal pain .  It makes up about 20% of cases of antibiotic-associated diarrhea .  Antibiotics can contribute to detrimental changes in gut microbiota; specifically, they decrease short-chain fatty acid absorption which results in osmotic, or watery, diarrhea.  Complications may include pseudomembranous colitis , toxic megacolon , perforation of the colon , and sepsis .  Clostridioides difficile infection is spread by bacterial spores found within feces .  Surfaces may become contaminated with the spores with further spread occurring via the hands of healthcare workers.  Risk factors for infection include antibiotic or proton pump inhibitor use, hospitalization, other health problems, and older age.  Diagnosis is by stool culture or testing for the bacteria's DNA or toxins .  If a person tests positive but has no symptoms, the condition is known as C. difficile colonization rather than an infection. 	4.6247616
Animal euthanasia  is the act of putting an animal to death or allowing it to die by without it facing extreme medical measures. Reasons for euthanasia include incurable  conditions or diseases,  lack of resources to continue supporting the animal, or laboratory test procedures. Euthanasia methods are designed to cause minimal pain and distress. Euthanasia is distinct from animal slaughter and pest control although in some cases the procedure is the same. In pet animals, this process is commonly referred to by euphemisms such as "put down" or "put to sleep".

Either the small bowel or large bowel may be affected.  Signs and symptoms include abdominal pain , vomiting , bloating and not passing gas .  Mechanical obstruction is the cause of about 5 to 15% of cases of severe abdominal pain of sudden onset requiring admission to hospital.   Causes of bowel obstruction include adhesions , hernias , volvulus , endometriosis , inflammatory bowel disease , appendicitis , tumors , diverticulitis , ischemic bowel , tuberculosis and intussusception .   Small bowel obstructions are most often due to adhesions and hernias while large bowel obstructions are most often due to tumors and volvulus.   The diagnosis may be made on plain X-rays ; however, CT scan is more accurate.  Ultrasound or MRI may help in the diagnosis of children or pregnant women. 	4.59377

A cerebral infarction is an area of necrotic tissue in the brain caused from a blockage or narrowing in the arteries supplying blood and oxygen to the brain. The lack of oxygen due to the low blood supply causes an ischemic stroke that can result in an infarction if the blood flow is not restored within a relatively short period of time. The blockage can be due to a thrombus , an embolus or an atheromatous stenosis of one or more arteries .  Which arteries are problematic will determine which areas of the brain are affected . These varying infarcts will produce different symptoms and outcomes. About one third will prove fatal.	A cerebral infarction is an area of necrotic tissue in the brain .

If the infarct is located in the primary motor cortex , contralateral hemiparesis is said to occur. With brainstem localization, brainstem syndromes are typical: Wallenberg's syndrome , Weber's syndrome , Millard–Gubler syndrome , Benedikt syndrome or others.	4.592256
Operation Moonshot is a programme by the UK government to allow many people in England to be tested for COVID-19 as a way to allow large gatherings of people to happen there while maintaining control over the virus. According to the British Medical Journal , the programme aims to perform 10 million tests per day by 2021. People are worried about it because, as a leaked government document says, it is thought it may cost £100bn, which is about three-quarters of what the NHS England costs every year. Statisticians say because any test can have inaccuracies, mass testing at this scale might cause hundreds of thousands of false positives a day, resulting in very large numbers of people being told they are infected when they are not infected.

It was co-chaired by physicians David A. Kessler , Marcella Nunez-Smith , and Vivek Murthy and comprises 13 health experts. The board was then succeeded by the White House COVID-19 Response Team upon Biden's presidency. Before naming any White House staff or cabinet appointments, Biden announced that he will appoint a COVID-19 task force, co-chaired by former Surgeon General Vivek Murthy , former Food and Drug Administration Commissioner David Kessler and Yale University epidemiologist Professor Marcella Nunez-Smith .   In November 2020, he announced the names of 13 health experts to serve on the COVID-19 Advisory Board.  Biden pledged a more and larger federal government response to the pandemic than Donald Trump , akin to President Franklin D. Roosevelt 's New Deal during the Great Depression .  This would include increased testing for SARS-CoV-2 , a steady supply of personal protective equipment , distributing a vaccine and securing money from Congress for schools and hospitals under the aegis of a national "supply chain commander" who would coordinate the logistics of manufacturing and distributing protective gear and test kits. This would be distributed by a "Pandemic Testing Board", also similar to Roosevelt's War Production Board during World War II .  Biden also pledged to invoke the Defense Production Act more aggressively than Trump in order to build up supplies, as well as the mobilization of up to 100,000 Americans for a "public health jobs corps" of contact tracers to help track and prevent outbreaks. 	4.573257

Bone marrow failure happens when people who produce a low amount of red blood cells , white blood cells or platelets . Red blood cells transport oxygen to be spread throughout the body’s tissue. White blood cells fight off infections that enter the body. Bone marrow also has platelets , which trigger clotting , and thus help stop the blood flow when a wound occurs. 	Bone marrow failure occurs in individuals who produce an insufficient amount of red blood cells , white blood cells or platelets . Red blood cells transport oxygen to be distributed throughout the body’s tissue. White blood cells fight off infections that enter the body. Bone marrow also contains platelets , which trigger clotting , and thus help stop the blood flow when a wound occurs.  Bone marrow failure is associated with three types of diseases, Fanconi anemia , dyskeratosis congenita , and aplastic anemia . Fanconi anemia is an inherited blood disorder due to abnormal breakages in DNA genes. It is linked to hyperpigmentation, which is the darkening of an area of skin or nails caused by increased melanin. According to Histopathology, “However, in about 30% of FA patients no physical abnormalities are found”.  Dyskeratosis congenita often affects multiple parts of the body. Individuals with this disorder usually show changes in skin pigmentations, unusual fingernail growth, and mucosa leukoplakia; the inner part of the mouth is encased with white patches that may never resolve.  Aplastic anemia happens when bone marrow doesn’t produce enough new blood cells throughout the body. Aplastic anemia is an acquired autoimmune disease, which occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys healthy body tissue.  Bone marrow failure in both children and adults can be either inherited or acquired. Inherited bone marrow failure is often the cause in young children, while older children and adults may acquire the disease later in life.  A maturation defect in genes is a common cause of inherited bone marrow failure.  The most common cause of acquired bone marrow failure is aplastic anemia.  Working with chemicals such as benzene could be a factor in causing the illness. Other factors include radiation or chemotherapy treatments, and immune system problems.	4.526969
Acute respiratory distress syndrome  is a type of respiratory failure caused by a massive widespread inflammation in the lungs . Symptoms include shortness of breath , rapid breathing , and bluish skin color. For those who survive, a short life span is common as a result. Causes may include sepsis , pancreatitis , trauma , pneumonia , and aspiration . 	Acute respiratory distress syndrome  is a type of respiratory failure characterized by rapid onset of widespread inflammation in the lungs .  Symptoms include shortness of breath , rapid breathing , and bluish skin coloration .  For those who survive, a decreased quality of life is common.  Causes may include sepsis , pancreatitis , trauma , pneumonia , and aspiration .  The underlying mechanism involves diffuse injury to cells which form the barrier of the microscopic air sacs of the lungs , surfactant dysfunction, activation of the immune system , and dysfunction of the body's regulation of blood clotting .  In effect, ARDS impairs the lungs' ability to exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide .  Adult diagnosis is based on a PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio  of less than 300 mm Hg despite a positive end-expiratory pressure  of more than 5 cm H 2 O.  Cardiogenic pulmonary edema , as the cause, must be excluded.  The primary treatment involves mechanical ventilation together with treatments directed at the underlying cause.  Ventilation strategies include using low volumes and low pressures.  If oxygenation remains insufficient, lung recruitment maneuvers and neuromuscular blockers may be used.  If these are insufficient, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation  may be an option.  The syndrome is associated with a death rate between 35 and 50%. 	4.5248165

Dysautonomia or autonomic dysfunction is a condition in which the autonomic nervous system  does not work properly. This may affect the functioning of the heart , bladder , intestines , sweat glands , pupils , and blood vessels. Dysautonomia has many causes, not all of which may be classified as neuropathic .  A number of conditions can feature dysautonomia, such as Parkinson's disease , multiple system atrophy , and dementia with Lewy bodies ,  Ehlers-Danlos syndromes ,  autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy and autonomic neuropathy ,  HIV/AIDS ,  autonomic failure , and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome . The diagnosis is achieved through functional testing of the ANS, focusing on the affected organ system . Investigations may be performed to identify underlying disease processes that may have led to the development of symptoms or autonomic neuropathy. Symptomatic treatment is available for many symptoms associated with dysautonomia, and some disease processes can be directly treated.  The symptoms of dysautonomia, which are numerous and vary widely for each individual, are due to inefficient or unbalanced efferent signals sent via both systems.  The primary symptoms in individuals with dysautonomia include	4.51169
Cancer of unknown primary origin  is a term used to describe a cancer that is said to be at the metastatic stage at the time of diagnosis, but a primary tumor cannot be identified. A diagnosis of CUP requires a clinical picture  with metastatic disease and one or more biopsy results inconsistent with a primary tumor.  CUP is found in about 3 to 5% of all people diagnosed with invasive cancer,  and carries a poor prognosis in most  of those circumstances.  The other 15 to 20% of patients, however, have a relatively long survival with appropriate treatment.

The other 15 to 20% of patients, however, have a relatively long survival with appropriate treatment.  Most cancers typically present as a single primary tumor .  Over the course of time—particularly if the primary tumor is left untreated—smaller "satellite" tumors will appear at other places in the body, a phenomenon known as metastasis .  Less commonly, a metastatic tumor is found first; but in most such cases, the primary tumor can then be located via examination and testing.  Rarely , the primary tumor cannot be found because it is too small, or because it has regressed due to immune system activity or other factors. In such situations a diagnosis of cancer of unknown primary origin  is made.	4.484686
Blood doping is a way of increasing the number of red blood cells in the bloodstream. This is done to improve athletic performance. Because blood cells carry oxygen from the lungs to the muscles , a having more red cells in the blood can improve an athlete’s aerobic capacity  and endurance .  Many methods of blood doping are illegal, particularly in professional sport. There are a number of different methods. Frozen blood taken from the individual previously can be used for a later transplant; packed red cells from a compatible donor may be used, and blood substitutes may be used. The growth area in illegal blood doping of athletes is blood substitutes.	Blood doping is the practice of boosting the number of red blood cells in the bloodstream in order to enhance athletic performance. Because such blood cells carry oxygen from the lungs to the muscles , a higher concentration in the blood can improve an athlete's aerobic capacity  and endurance .  Blood doping can be achieved by making the body produce more red blood cells itself using drugs, giving blood transfusions either from another person or back to the same individual, or by using blood substitutes. Many methods of blood doping are illegal, particularly in professional sports where it is considered to give an artificial advantage to the competitor. Anti-doping agencies use tests to try to identify individuals who have been blood doping using a number of methods, typically by analysing blood samples from the competitors. Blood doping is defined as the use of illicit products , darbepoetin-alfa, hypoxia-inducible factor  stabilizers) and methods  in order to enhance the O 2 transport of the body to the muscles. 	4.3589773

Flattening the curve is a public health strategy to slow down the spread of the COVID-19 virus during the COVID-19 pandemic . The curve being flattened is the epidemic curve , a representation of the number of infected people needing health care over time. During an epidemic, a health care system can break down when the number of people infected passes the health care system's ability to take care of them. Flattening the curve means slowing the spread of the epidemic so that the peak number of people requiring care at a time is reduced, and the health care system does not pass its capacity.

A cyst is a closed sac, having a distinct membrane and division compared with the nearby tissue . It is a cluster of cells that has grouped together to form a sac however an aspect of a cyst is that the cells forming the "shell" of such a sac are distinctly abnormal when compared with all surrounding cells for that given location. It may contain air, fluids, or semi-solid material. A collection of pus is called an abscess , not a cyst. Once formed, sometimes a cyst may resolve on its own. When a cyst fails to resolve, it may need to be removed surgically, but that would depend upon its type and location.	A cyst is a closed sac, having a distinct envelope and division compared with the nearby tissue . Hence, it is a cluster of cells that have grouped together to form a sac ; however, the distinguishing aspect of a cyst is that the cells forming the "shell" of such a sac are distinctly abnormal  when compared with all surrounding cells for that given location. A cyst may contain air, fluids, or semi-solid material. A collection of pus is called an abscess , not a cyst. Once formed, a cyst may resolve on its own. When a cyst fails to resolve, it may need to be removed surgically , but that would depend upon its type and location. Cancer -related cysts are formed as a defense mechanism for the body following the development of mutations that lead to an uncontrolled cellular division . Once that mutation has occurred, the affected cells divide incessantly and become cancerous, forming a tumor . The body encapsulates those cells to try to prevent them from continuing their division and contain the tumor, which becomes known as a cyst. That said, the cancerous cells still may mutate further and gain the ability to form their own blood vessels , from which they receive nourishment before being contained. Once that happens, the capsule becomes useless, and the tumor may advance from benign to cancerous. Some cysts are neoplastic , and thus are called cystic tumors . Many types of cysts are not neoplastic, they are dysplastic or metaplastic . Pseudocysts are similar to cysts in that they have a sac filled with fluid, but lack an epithelial lining.	4.244812
Eradication is the lowering of an infectious disease 's existence in the global host population to zero.  It is sometimes confused with elimination, which describes either the reduction of an infectious disease's prevalence in a regional population to zero.	Eradication is the reduction of an infectious disease 's prevalence in the global host population to zero.  It is sometimes confused with elimination, which describes either the reduction of an infectious disease's prevalence in a regional population to zero or the reduction of the global prevalence to a negligible amount. Further confusion arises from the use of the term eradication to refer to the total removal of a given pathogen from an individual , particularly in the context of HIV and certain other viruses where such cures are sought. The selection of infectious diseases for eradication is based on rigorous criteria, as both biological and technical features determine whether a pathogenic organism is  eradicable. The targeted organism must not have a non-human reservoir , and/or amplify in the environment. This implies that sufficient information on the life cycle and transmission dynamics is available at the time an eradication initiative is programmed. An efficient and practical intervention  must be available to interrupt transmission of the infective agent. Studies of measles in the pre-vaccination era led to the concept of the critical community size , the size of the population below which a pathogen ceases to circulate.  The use of vaccination programs before the introduction of an eradication campaign can reduce the susceptible population. The disease to be eradicated should be clearly identifiable, and an accurate diagnostic tool should exist. Economic considerations, as well as societal and political support and commitment, are other crucial factors that determine eradication feasibility.  	4.2140894

Fatty liver disease , also known as hepatic steatosis , is a condition where a lot of fat builds up in the liver . Sometimes, there are no or few symptoms. There can be pain in the upper right side of the abdomen . The disease can cause cirrhosis , liver cancer , and esophageal cuts. 	Fatty liver disease , also known as hepatic steatosis , is a condition where excess fat builds up in the liver .  Often there are no or few symptoms.   Occasionally there may be tiredness or pain in the upper right side of the abdomen .  Complications may include cirrhosis , liver cancer , and esophageal varices .   There are two types of fatty liver disease: non-alcoholic fatty liver disease  and alcoholic liver disease .  NAFLD is made up of simple fatty liver and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis .   The primary risks include alcohol , type 2 diabetes , and obesity .   Other risk factors include certain medications such as glucocorticoids , and hepatitis C .  It is unclear why some people with NAFLD develop simple fatty liver and others develop NASH.  Diagnosis is based on the medical history supported by blood tests, medical imaging , and occasionally liver biopsy .  It is recommended that people with fatty liver disease do not drink alcohol.   Treatment of NAFLD is generally otherwise by dietary changes and exercise to bring about weight loss .  In those who are severely affected, liver transplantation may be an option.  More than 90% of all heavy drinkers develop fatty liver while about 25% develop the more severe alcoholic hepatitis .  NAFLD affects about 30% of people in Western countries and 10% of people in Asia.  NAFLD affects about 10% of children in the United States.  It occurs more often in older people and males.  	4.170763
Public health is the science dealing with prevention there is a disease that is a threat to the overall health of a community, as well as with prolonging life and promoting health .  The aims are achieved through the organized efforts and informed choices of society, public and private organizations, communities and individuals. It bases on health analysis of a handful of people or all the inhabitants of several continents rather than on an individual.  Public health includes such parts as epidemiology ,        biostatistics ,  health services, environmental , social, behavioral , and occupational health .  Public health intervention prevents rather than treats a disease through surveillance of cases and promotes healthy behaviors such as hand washing , vaccination programs and distribution of condoms . In outbreaks of an infectious disease , treating a disease may be vital to preventing it in others. Most countries have their own government public health agencies, sometimes known as ministries of health, to respond to domestic health issues. Many diseases are preventable through simple, non-medical methods. Public health plays an important role in disease prevention efforts in the developing world and in developed countries, through local health systems and through international non-governmental organizations . In the developing world, there may not be enough trained health workers or monetary resources to provide a basic level of medical care and disease prevention.	Public health has been defined as "the science and art of preventing disease ”, prolonging life and improving quality of life through organized efforts and informed choices of society , organizations , communities and individuals .  Analyzing the determinants of health of a population and the threats it faces is the basis for public health.  The public can be as small as a handful of people or as large as a village or an entire city; in the case of a pandemic it may encompass several continents. The concept of health takes into account physical, psychological , and social well-being . As such, according to the World Health Organization , it is not merely the absence of disease or infirmity and more recently, a resource for everyday living.  Public health is an interdisciplinary field. For example, epidemiology , biostatistics , social sciences and management of health services are all relevant. Other important sub-fields include environmental health , community health , behavioral health , health economics , public policy , mental health , health education , health politics , occupational safety , disability , gender issues in health, and sexual and reproductive health .  Public health, together with primary care , secondary care, and tertiary care , is part of a country's overall health care system. Many interventions of public health interest are delivered outside of health facilities , such as food safety surveillance, distribution of condoms and needle-exchange programs for the prevention of transmissible diseases. Public health is not the same as public healthcare .	4.166623
The COVID-19 pandemic in Canada is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019  caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 . The disease was confirmed to have reached Canada on January 27, 2020, after a man who had returned to Toronto from Wuhan , Hubei , China, tested positive. As of September 10, 2020  , there have been over 134,000 confirmed cases, 118,000 recoveries and 9,000 deaths in the country.  The Government of Canada says that around 11,000–22,000 deaths could happen over the course of the pandemic.  Most of those cases are in Canada's most populous provinces, Ontario   and Quebec .  Confirmed cases have been reported in all of Canada's provinces and territories, with the exception of Nunavut . An additional 13 cases involve citizens from the Grand Princess cruise ship.

The COVID-19 pandemic , also called the coronavirus pandemic , is a current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 . It is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 .    The outbreak started in Wuhan , Hubei , China, in December 2019. The World Health Organization  called it a pandemic on 11 March 2020.      The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses gave the virus its name. As of February 19, 2021, more than 110 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in more than 188 countries and territories. More than two million people have died of COVID-19,  and more than 85 million people have defeated, or recovered from the disease.    The virus usually moves from one person to another with small drops made when coughing   or sneezing .  It mostly spreads when people are close to each other, which is why social distancing is encouraged. Coronavirus can also spread when people touch a surface with the virus, and then they touch their face.   Common symptoms include fever , cough, and trouble breathing.  The illness can worsen with pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome .  As of January 2021, a number of vaccines for COVID-19 have been developed, but only a few have been approved as safe for use. The first vaccine to be approved was created by Pfizer and BioNTech ,  followed by the Oxford / AstraZeneca  vaccine. Vaccine distribution has begun in many countries in Europe, North America, South America and Asia.  The United Kingdom was the first western country to administer a COVID-19 vaccine.  No antiviral medicine for COVID-19 is available.  Doctors usually give patients supportive therapy instead.  People can avoid spreading the virus by regularly washing their hands, covering their mouth when coughing, maintaining distance from other people , staying away from crowds, wearing medical or cloth face coverings, and being alone for people who think they are infected, also known as quarantining .  The outbreak might be from a coronavirus that usually lives in bats . This infected another animal, possibly a pangolin . It then changed inside that other animal until it could infect humans.  It originated at a wet market Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market and is linked to China’s wild animal meat trade. Live foxes , crocodiles , wolf pups, giant salamanders , snakes , rats , peacocks , porcupines , koalas and game meats were on the menu at the market.  A 55-year-old person from Hubei province was the first human to contract the virus on November 17, 2019.  A 61-year-old man who was a regular customer at the market was the first person to die from the virus on January 11, 2020.  The exact origin of the virus is still unknown since the market in Wuhan sold a variety of live wild animals in cages. Chinese tourists have spread the virus by traveling to other countries and made it a worldwide pandemic.  Racism and xenophobia against Chinese people and Asians increased during the pandemic.	The COVID-19 pandemic , also known as the coronavirus pandemic , is an ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019  caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 . The virus was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan , China . The World Health Organization declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern regarding COVID-19 on 30 January 2020, and later declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020. As of 1 June 2021, more than 170 million cases have been confirmed, with more than 3.55 million confirmed deaths attributed to COVID-19, making it one of the deadliest pandemics in history . Symptoms of COVID-19 are highly variable, ranging from none to life-threateningly severe. COVID-19 transmits when people breathe in air contaminated by droplets and small airborne particles. The risk of breathing these in is highest when people are in close proximity, but they can be inhaled over longer distances, particularly indoors. Transmission can also occur if splashed or sprayed with contaminated fluids, in the eyes nose or mouth, and rarely via contaminated surfaces. People remain contagious for up to 20 days, and can spread the virus even if they do not develop any symptoms.  	4.1245146

It was a popular remedy in the nineteenth century, and it was used to purge and revitalise the bowels. In use, it is swallowed and allowed to pass through the body, after which it is customarily recovered for reuse, giving rise to the name everlasting pill . The antimonial cup yielded the same effect.  According to the Medico-Pharmaceutical Critic and Guide , edited by William J. Robinson : We have     referred in the past to the economy which used to be practiced by our fore-fathers. Thus, for instance, it was customary to use leeches over and over again and there are instances of infection with syphilis by leeches that had been previously used on luetic patients. But we believe that the everlasting cathartic pill beats everything in the line of economy. This pill was a little bullet composed of metallic antimony which had or was believed to have the property of purging as often as it was swallowed. It is not inconceivable that it might have had such property, for it is possible that a minute amount was dissolved by the gastro-intestinal juices and this amount, plus the suggestion, was sufficient to produce cathartic action. Then again the everlasting pill probably aided peristalsis by its mechanical weight and motion. The bullet was passed out, recovered from the feces and used over and over again. This, as Dr. J. A. Paris says, was economy in right earnest, for a single pill would serve a whole family during their lives and might be transmitted as an heirloom to posterity. 	4.0985065

Polydipsia is excessive thirst or excess drinking. The word derives from the Greek πολυδίψιος  "very thirsty", which is gotten from πολύς  + δίψα . Polydipsia is a symptom in many diseases . It also occurs as a weird behaviour in some animals , such as in birds .  Polydipsia can be a symptom of diabetes mellitus . It is seen in cases of poorly controlled diabetes. Diabetes insipidus can also cause polydipsia.  It can also be caused by a change in the osmolality of the extracellular fluids of the body, hypokalemia , decreased blood volume, and other conditions that create water deficiency.  Polydipsia is a symptom and not a disease in itself. Polydipsia investigations at diagnosing diabetes insipidus and diabetes mellitus can be useful. 	Polydipsia is excessive thirst or excess drinking.  The word derives from the Greek πολυδίψιος  "very thirsty",  which is derived from πολύς  + δίψα .  Polydipsia is a nonspecific symptom in various medical disorders. It also occurs as an abnormal behaviour in some non-human animals , such as in birds .  Polydipsia can be characteristic of diabetes mellitus , often as an initial symptom. It is observed in cases of poorly controlled diabetes, which is sometimes the result of low patient adherence to anti-diabetic medication .  Diabetes insipidus  can also cause polydipsia. 	4.0695844
Medical Subject Headings  is a way to keep track of for the purpose of journal articles and books in the life sciences; it can also serve as a thesaurus that makes searching easier. Created and updated by the United States National Library of Medicine , it is used by the MEDLINE / PubMed article database and by NLM's catalog of book holdings. MeSH was introduced in 1963. The yearly printed version was discontinued in 2007 and MeSH is now available online only.  It can be browsed and downloaded free of charge through PubMed . Originally in English, MeSH has been translated into numerous other languages and allows retrieval of documents from different languages.	Medical Subject Headings  is a comprehensive controlled vocabulary for the purpose of indexing journal articles and books in the life sciences . It serves as a thesaurus that facilitates searching. Created and updated by the United States National Library of Medicine , it is used by the MEDLINE / PubMed article database and by NLM's catalog of book holdings. MeSH is also used by ClinicalTrials.gov registry to classify which diseases are studied by trials registered in ClinicalTrials. MeSH was introduced in the 1960s, with the NLM's own index catalogue and the subject headings of the Quarterly Cumulative Index Medicus  as precursors. The yearly printed version of MeSH was discontinued in 2007 and MeSH is now available online only.  It can be browsed and downloaded free of charge through PubMed. Originally in English, MeSH has been translated into numerous other languages and allows retrieval of documents from different origins. MeSH vocabulary is divided into four types of terms. The main ones are the "headings" , which describe the subject of each article . Most of these are accompanied by a short description or definition, links to related descriptors, and a list of synonyms or very similar terms . MeSH contains approximately 27,000 entries and is updated annually to reflect changes in medicine and medical terminology.  MeSH terms are arranged in alphabetic order and in a hierarchical structure by subject categories with more specific terms arranged beneath broader terms. When we search for a MeSH term, the most specific MeSH terms are automatically included in the search. This is known as the extended search or explode of that MeSH term. This additional information and the hierarchical structure  make the MeSH essentially a thesaurus , rather than a plain subject headings list. 	4.0599804
Gastroenterology is a special type of medicine .  It is about the digestive system . Diseases of the gastrointestinal tract are the focus.  The tract includes the organs from mouth to anus . Physicians in this type of medicine are called gastroenterologists .	Gastroenterology  is the branch of medicine focused on the digestive system and its disorders. Diseases affecting the gastrointestinal tract , which include the organs from mouth into anus , along the alimentary canal , are the focus of this speciality. Physicians practicing in this field are called gastroenterologists . They have usually completed about eight years of pre-medical and medical education , a year-long internship , three years of an internal medicine residency, and three years in the gastroenterology fellowship . Gastroenterologists perform a number of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures including colonoscopy , esophagogastroduodenoscopy , endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography , endoscopic ultrasound , and liver biopsy .  Some gastroenterology trainees will complete a "fourth-year"  in transplant hepatology , advanced interventional endoscopy , inflammatory bowel disease , motility , or other topics. Advanced endoscopy, sometimes called interventional or surgical endoscopy, is a sub-specialty of gastroenterology that focuses on advanced endoscopic techniques for the treatment of pancreatic , hepatobiliary , and gastrointestinal disease . Interventional gastroenterologists typically undergo an additional year of rigorous training in advanced endoscopic techniques including endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, endoscopic ultrasound-guided diagnostic and interventional procedures, and advanced resection techniques including endoscopic mucosal resection and endoscopic submucosal dissection . Additionally, the performance of endoscopic bariatric procedures is also performed by some advanced endoscopists.	4.034878

Dystonia is a neurological hyperkinetic movement disorder syndrome in which sustained or repetitive muscle contractions result in twisting and repetitive movements or abnormal fixed postures.  The movements may resemble a tremor . Dystonia is often intensified or exacerbated by physical activity, and symptoms may progress into adjacent muscles.  The disorder may be hereditary or caused by other factors such as birth-related or other physical trauma , infection , poisoning  or reaction to pharmaceutical drugs , particularly neuroleptics ,  or stress. Treatment must be highly customized to the needs of the individual and may include oral medications, chemodenervation botulinum neurotoxin injections, physical therapy, or other supportive therapies, and surgical procedures such as deep brain stimulation .	4.0167127
An adrenal tumor or adrenal mass  is any benign or malignant neoplasms of the adrenal gland . They are known to overproduce endocrine hormones . Adrenal cancer is when there are malignant adrenal tumors, and includes neuroblastoma , adrenocortical carcinoma and some adrenal pheochromocytomas . Most adrenal pheochromocytomas and all adrenocortical adenomas are benign tumors, which do not metastasize or destroy nearby tissues, but may cause significant health problems by unbalancing hormones.	An adrenal tumor or adrenal mass  is any benign or malignant neoplasms of the adrenal gland , several of which are notable for their tendency to overproduce endocrine hormones . Adrenal cancer is the presence of malignant adrenal tumors, and includes neuroblastoma , adrenocortical carcinoma and some adrenal pheochromocytomas . Most adrenal pheochromocytomas and all adrenocortical adenomas are benign tumors, which do not metastasize or invade nearby tissues, but may cause significant health problems by unbalancing hormones. Metastasis to one or both adrenal glands is the most common form of malignant adrenal lesion, and the second most common adrenal tumor after benign adenomas.  Primary tumors in such cases are most commonly from lung cancer , breast cancer , malignant melanoma , gastrointestinal tract cancer , pancreas cancer , and renal cancer .  The adrenal cortex is composed of three distinct layers of endocrine cells which produce critical steroid hormones . These include the glucocorticoids which are critical for regulation of blood sugar and the immune system , as well as response to physiological stress , the mineralcorticoid aldosterone , which regulates blood pressure and kidney function, and certain sex hormones . Both benign and malignant tumors of the adrenal cortex may produce steroid hormones, with important clinical consequences. 	4.010418

An appendectomy , also termed appendicectomy , is a surgical operation in which the vermiform appendix  is removed. Appendectomy is normally performed as an urgent or emergency procedure to treat complicated acute appendicitis .  Appendectomy may be performed laparoscopically  or as an open operation.  Over the 2010s, surgical practice has increasingly moved towards routinely offering laparoscopic appendicectomy; for example in the United Kingdom over 95% of adult appendicectomies are planned as laparoscopic procedures.  Laparoscopy is often used if the diagnosis is in doubt, or in order to leave a less visible surgical scar. Recovery may be slightly faster after laparoscopic surgery, although the laparoscopic procedure itself is more expensive and resource-intensive than open surgery and generally takes longer. Advanced pelvic sepsis occasionally requires a lower midline laparotomy . Both uncomplicated  and complicated  appendicitis should undergo prompt surgical intervention.  The difference in treatment occurs post-operatively with respect to the length of time the antibiotics are administered. For uncomplicated appendicitis, antibiotics should be continued up to 24 hours post-operatively. For complicated appendicitis, antibiotics should be continued for anywhere between 3 and 7 days.  An interval appendectomy is generally performed 6-8 weeks after conservative management with antibiotics for special cases, such as perforated appendicitis.  Delay of appendectomy 24 hours after admission for symptoms of appendicitis has not shown to increase risk of perforation or other complications. 	3.9997947
GISAID is open-access to genetic data of influenza viruses,  and the coronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic.   On January 10, 2020, the first whole-genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 were made available on GISAID. This enabled global responses to the pandemic.  There was the first vaccines,  and diagnostic tests,  to detect SARS-CoV-2. GISAID helps watch for the emergence of new COVID-19 viral strains across the planet.   Its establishment was an alternative to sharing avian influenza data by conventional public-domain archives.    GISAID has given rapid exchange of outbreak data  during the H1N1 pandemic   in 2009, the H7N9 epidemic   in 2013, and the COVID-19 pandemic   in 2020. GISAID was recognized for its importance to world health by G20 health ministers in 2017,  and in 2020 the World Health Organization chief scientist called the data-science initiative "a game changer".

In medicine , an adverse effect is a harmful and undesired effect that results from a therapy like medication , chemotherapy , surgery or other intervention. An adverse effect may be called a "side-effect" . It may result from an unsuitable or incorrect dosage or procedure . Some adverse effects happen only at the beginning or a change of a treatment. In many countries, adverse effects have to be reported and researched in clinical trials and included into the patient information accompanying medical devices and drugs for sale to the public.	An adverse effect is an undesired harmful effect resulting from a medication or other intervention , such as surgery .  An adverse effect may be termed a " side effect ", when judged to be secondary to a main or therapeutic effect . If it results from an unsuitable or incorrect dosage or procedure, this is called a medical error and not a complication . Adverse effects are sometimes referred to as " iatrogenic " because they are generated by a physician /treatment. Some adverse effects occur only when starting, increasing or discontinuing a treatment. Adverse effects can also be caused by placebo treatments .   Using a drug or other medical intervention which is contraindicated may increase the risk of adverse effects. Adverse effects may cause complications of a disease or procedure and negatively affect its prognosis . They may also lead to non-compliance with a treatment regimen. Adverse effects of medical treatment resulted in 142,000 deaths in 2013 up from 94,000 deaths in 1990 globally.  The harmful outcome is usually indicated by some result such as morbidity , mortality , alteration in body weight , levels of enzymes , loss of function, or as a pathological change detected at the microscopic, macroscopic or physiological level. It may also be indicated by symptoms reported by a patient. Adverse effects may cause a reversible or irreversible change, including an increase or decrease in the susceptibility of the individual to other chemicals, foods , or procedures, such as drug interactions . In terms of drugs, adverse events may be defined as: “Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment.” 	3.9620507
Neck pain is a common problem, and two thirds of people will experience neck pain at some point in their lifetimes. Although neck pain is felt in the neck, it can also be caused by many other spinal problems. Neck pain may be caused by tight muscles in the neck and upper back or compression of the spinal nerves in the neck. Injuries to the joints of the neck and upper back can also cause pain.	Neck pain , also known as cervicalgia , is a common problem, with two-thirds of the population having neck pain at some point in their lives.  Neck pain, although felt in the neck , can be caused by numerous other spinal problems. Neck pain may arise due to muscular tightness in both the neck and upper back, or pinching of the nerves emanating from the cervical vertebrae . Joint disruption in the neck creates pain, as does joint disruption in the upper back. The head is supported by the lower neck and upper back, and it is these areas that commonly cause neck pain. The top three joints in the neck allow for most movement of the neck and head. The lower joints in the neck and those of the upper back create a supportive structure for the head to sit on. If this support system is affected adversely, then the muscles in the area will tighten, leading to neck pain.	3.9568627

Coronaviruses are a group of RNA viruses .   They cause diseases in birds and mammals , including humans . These diseases can be mild, or they can be fatal. In humans and birds, they cause respiratory tract infections. Mild illnesses in humans include some cases of the common cold . More lethal varieties can cause SARS , MERS , and COVID-19 . They are enveloped viruses with a positive-sense RNA genome .  The genome size of coronaviruses is about 26 to 32 kilobases,  which is extraordinarily large for an RNA virus . There are four major groups of coronaviruses, called alpha, beta, gamma and delta. The most famous coronavirus is one of the betas, the kind that causes Coronavirus disease 2019  in humans. The name "coronavirus" comes from the Latin word corona , meaning "crown" or "halo", and refers to how virions look under an electron microscopy .  They have a fringe of large, bulbous surface projections looking like a crown. This morphology is created by the viral spike  peplomers , which are proteins on the surface of the virus. They decide which cells the virus can infect.	Coronaviruses are a group of related RNA viruses that cause diseases in mammals and birds . In humans and birds, they cause respiratory tract infections that can range from mild to lethal. Mild illnesses in humans include some cases of the common cold , while more lethal varieties can cause SARS , MERS , and COVID-19 . In cows and pigs they cause diarrhea , while in mice they cause hepatitis and encephalomyelitis . Coronaviruses constitute the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae , in the family Coronaviridae , order Nidovirales , and realm Riboviria .   They are enveloped viruses with a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome and a nucleocapsid of helical symmetry.  The genome size of coronaviruses ranges from approximately 26 to 32 kilobases , one of the largest among RNA viruses.  They have characteristic club-shaped spikes that project from their surface, which in electron micrographs create an image reminiscent of the solar corona , from which their name derives. 	3.916486

Itch  is an unpleasant sensation that leads to the desire or reflex to scratch . Itch has many similarities to pain and both are unpleasant sensory experiences but their behavioral response patterns are different. Pain creates a reflex withdrawal while itch leads to a scratch reflex.  Nerve fibers for itch and pain both are in the skin , but information for them is sent centrally in two distinct systems that both use the same nerve bundle.  Historically, the sensations of itch and pain have not been considered to be independent of each other until recently where it was found that itch has several features in common with pain but has important differences.  The feeling of itchiness can be caused by a movement of hair or the release of a chemical  from cells under the skin. Itchiness is regarded as protective, as it helps creatures remove parasites that land on their skin. Itching can be caused by:	Itch  is a sensation that causes the desire or reflex to scratch.  Itch has resisted many attempts to be classified as any one type of sensory experience. Itch has many similarities to pain , and while both are unpleasant sensory experiences, their behavioral response patterns are different. Pain creates a withdrawal reflex , whereas itch leads to a scratch reflex .  Unmyelinated nerve fibers for itch and pain both originate in the skin ; however, information for them is conveyed centrally in two distinct systems that both use the same nerve bundle and spinothalamic tract .  Most commonly, an itch is felt in one place.  If it is felt all over the body, then it is called generalized itch or generalized pruritus . 	3.866964
The Bristol stool scale is a medical diagnosis tool used by Doctors to classify the way feces looks into 7 different categories .  It is also known by the names, Bristol stool chart and Bristol stool form scale .

Ankylosing spondylitis  is a type of arthritis . There is a long-term inflammation of the joints of the spine .  Usually the joints where the spine joins the pelvis are also affected. Eye and bowel problems may also occur. Pain in the back is a typical symptom of AS, and it often comes and goes.  Stiffness of the affected joints usually gets worse over time.  	Ankylosing spondylitis  is a type of arthritis in which there is a long-term inflammation of the joints of the spine .  Typically the joints where the spine joins the pelvis are also affected.  Occasionally other joints such as the shoulders or hips are involved.  Eye and bowel problems may also occur.  Back pain is a characteristic symptom of AS, and it often comes and goes.  Stiffness of the affected joints generally worsens over time.   Although the cause of ankylosing spondylitis is unknown, it is believed to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors.  More than 85% of those affected in the UK have a specific human leukocyte antigen known as the HLA-B27 antigen.  The underlying mechanism is believed to be autoimmune or autoinflammatory .  Diagnosis is typically based on the symptoms with support from medical imaging and blood tests .  AS is a type of seronegative spondyloarthropathy , meaning that tests show no presence of rheumatoid factor  antibodies .  It is also within a broader category known as axial spondyloarthritis . 	3.8574107

The second cholera pandemic is also known as the Asiatic cholera pandemic . It was a cholera pandemic that spread from India to the entire West Asia , then to the United Kingdom and the Americas , and then to China and Japan . The cause of cholera was not known until later in the 19th century. Cholera and typhus are bacterial diseases. Cholera spread by the absence of, or defective, sewage treatment or defective water supply systems. Typhus is spread by lice , chiggers and fleas .	The second cholera pandemic , also known as the Asiatic cholera pandemic , was a cholera pandemic that reached from India across western Asia to Europe , Great Britain , and the Americas , as well as east to China and Japan .  Cholera caused more deaths, more quickly, than any other epidemic disease in the 19th century  .   The medical community now believes cholera to be exclusively a human disease, spread through many means of travel during the time, and transmitted through warm fecal-contaminated river waters and contaminated foods. During the second pandemic, the scientific community varied in its beliefs about the causes of cholera. The first cholera pandemic  began near Calcutta and spread throughout Southeast Asia to the Middle East, eastern Africa, and the Mediterranean coast. While cholera had spread across India many times previously, this outbreak went further; it reached as far as China and the Mediterranean Sea before receding. Hundreds of thousands of people died as a result of this pandemic , including many British soldiers , which attracted European attention. This was the first of several cholera pandemics to sweep through Asia and Europe during the 19th and 20th centuries. This first pandemic spread over an unprecedented range of territory, affecting almost every country in Asia.  Historians believe that the first pandemic had lingered in Indonesia and the Philippines in 1830. 	3.793619

Topical decongestants on topical application as dilute solution  produce local vasoconstriction . Regular use of decongestants for long periods should be avoided because mucosal ciliary function is impaired: atrophic rhinitis and anosmia  can occur due to persistent vasoconstriction.	3.7730157
Electrology is an electrical process to remove human hair so that it does not grow back. An electrologist is sometimes called an electrolysist in the United Kingdom . The process of removing the hair is referred to as electrolysis. The electrolysist slides a thin metal probe into each hair follicle . This, if done the right way, does not hurt the skin. Electricity flows to the follicle through the probe. This causes damage to the areas that grow hair so that it does not grow back.	Electrology is the practice of electrical hair removal to permanently remove human hair from the body. Electrolysis is the actual process of removing hair using electricity. In electrolysis, a qualified professional called an electrologist slides a hair-thin, solid metal probe into each hair follicle without puncturing the skin . Electricity is delivered to the follicle through the probe, which causes localized damage to the areas that generate hairs, either through the formation of caustic sodium hydroxide , overheating , or both . All three methods  have their own merits, and one method is not better than another. The success depends on the skill of the electrologist, the type of hair being removed, the condition of the skin and the pain threshold of the client. All three methods, when properly performed, can be thorough at destroying the hair matrix cells, and leaving follicles incapable of regrowing hair.	3.725146

In January 2020, conspiracy theories spread which said that the the COVID-19 pandemic came from a virus made by the WIV. But scientific evidence says that the virus is natural.      One story in the Washington Post said that US State Department had raised safety concerns about WIV's research on bat coronaviruses in 2018.  In April 2020, U.S. intelligence officials looked into reports the virus may have started by an accident by WIV scientists studying bats.     Experts do not believe the virus escaped from the institute.   One expert said that up to seven million people in Southeast Asia are infected each year with bat coronaviruses. He said there are probably only about six people who work with the viruses at the institute.  It does not make sense that virus came from one of these of people compared with the millions of other people affected by bats.

The institute has been an active research center for the study of coronaviruses . The WIV was founded in 1956 as the Wuhan Microbiology Laboratory under the Chinese Academy of Sciences . In 1961, it became the South China Institute of Microbiology, and in 1962 was renamed Wuhan Microbiology Institute. In 1970, it became the Microbiology Institute of Hubei Province when the Hubei Commission of Science and Technology took over the administration. In June 1978, it was returned to the CAS and renamed Wuhan Institute of Virology. 	3.6713202
Sexual addiction is when people engage in sexual activities, especially sexual intercourse , even if this has negative consequences for them.  Some scientists believe it is one of several sex-related disorders within an umbrella concept known as hypersexual disorder .  The term sexual dependence is also used to refer to people who report being unable to control their sexual urges , behaviors, or thoughts.  Other related models of pathological sexual behavior include hypersexuality , erotomania , Don Juanism , and paraphilia -related disorders.    Not all people agree that the condition sexual addicion exists.   There is considerable debate among psychiatrists , psychologists , sexologists , and other specialists whether compulsive sexual behavior constitutes an addiction. They also disagree about its  classification and possible diagnosis. Research on animals has shown that compulsive sexual behavior uses the same mechanism of action that is also responsible for drug addiction in laboratory animals. As of 2018, neither  the DSM or ICD medical classifications recognise sexual addiction as a valid diagnosis.	Sexual addiction , also known as sex addiction , is a state characterized by compulsive participation or engagement in sexual activity , particularly sexual intercourse , despite negative consequences.  Proponents of a diagnostic model for sexual addiction consider it to be one of several sex-related disorders within hypersexual disorder .  The term sexual dependence is also used to refer to people who report being unable to control their sexual urges , behaviors, or thoughts. Related or synonymous models of pathological sexual behavior include hypersexuality , erotomania , Don Juanism , and paraphilia -related disorders.    The concept of sexual addiction is contentious.   There is considerable debate among psychiatrists , psychologists , sexologists , and other specialists whether compulsive sexual behavior constitutes an addiction, and therefore its classification and possible diagnosis. Animal research has established that compulsive sexual behavior arises from the same transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms that mediate drug addiction in laboratory animals; however, as of 2018,  sexual addiction is not a clinical diagnosis in either the DSM or ICD medical classifications of diseases and medical disorders. Some argue that applying such concepts to normal behaviors such as sex can be problematic, and suggest that applying medical models such as addiction to human sexuality can serve to pathologise normal behavior and cause harm. 	3.656431
Coronary artery bypass surgery is a type of surgery that relieves chest pain , caused by lack of blood flow , and reduces the risk of death from heart disease . It is also known as coronary artery bypass graft  surgery, and known by doctors as heart bypass or bypass surgery . In this surgery, blood vessels from elsewhere in the patient's body are added to the heart vessels to go around blood vessels blocked by fat and get more blood into the heart so it can keep running. This surgery usually happens with the heart stopped, which makes machines that act as lungs and heart needed. However, it is possible to have the surgery with the heart still pumping, called "off-pump" surgery.	Coronary artery bypass surgery , also known as coronary artery bypass graft  surgery , and colloquially heart bypass or bypass surgery , is a surgical procedure to restore normal blood flow to an obstructed coronary artery . A normal coronary artery transports blood to the heart muscle itself, not through the main circulatory system . There are two main approaches. In one, the left internal thoracic artery , LITA  is diverted to the left anterior descending branch of the left coronary artery . In this method, the artery is " pedicled " which means it is not detached from the origin. In the other, a great saphenous vein is removed from a leg; one end is attached to the aorta or one of its major branches, and the other end is attached to the obstructed artery immediately after the obstruction to restore blood flow. CABG is performed to relieve angina unsatisfactorily controlled by maximum tolerated anti-ischemic medication, prevent or relieve left ventricular dysfunction , and/or reduce the risk of death. CABG does not prevent myocardial infarction . This surgery is usually performed with the heart stopped, necessitating the usage of cardiopulmonary bypass . However, two alternative techniques are also available, allowing CABG to be performed on a beating heart either without using the cardiopulmonary bypass, a procedure referred to as "off-pump" surgery, or performing beating surgery using partial assistance of the cardiopulmonary bypass, a procedure referred to as "on-pump beating" surgery. The latter procedure offers the advantages of the on-pump stopped and off-pump while minimizing their respective side-effects.	3.6439962
Escitalopram is an antidepressant medication . It is used as a drug to help treat depression , obsessive-compulsive disorder , social anxiety disorder and other mental illnesses . It is commonly known and sold as Lexapro or Cipralex .  Escitalopram can cause sleeping problems, dry mouth and diarrhea . It can also cause sexual problems.  These sexual problems usually disappear after a person stops using the drug. However, in some cases these problems can last for months or years.	Escitalopram , sold under the brand names Cipralex and Lexapro , among others, is an antidepressant of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor  class.  Escitalopram is mainly used to treat major depressive disorder or generalized anxiety disorder .  It is taken by mouth.  Common side effects include trouble sleeping, nausea, sexual problems , and feeling tired.  More serious side effects may include suicide in people under the age of 25.  It is unclear if use during pregnancy or breastfeeding is safe.  Escitalopram is the - stereoisomer  of citalopram , hence the name es citalopram.  In other words, escitalopram is a chiral switch of citalopram. Escitalopram was approved for medical use in the United States in 2002.  Escitalopram is sometimes replaced by twice the dose of citalopram.  In 2018, it was the 22nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States with more than 25 million prescriptions.  	3.6346734
The first confirmed case relating to the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria was announced on February 27 2020, when an Italian citizen in Lagos tested positive for the virus SARS-CoV-2 .   On March 9, 2020, a second case of the virus was reported in Ewekoro , Ogun State , in a Nigerian citizen who had contact with the Italian citizen.  On March 23, there were ten new cases: six in Lagos State, three in the FCT and one in Edo State .  They also confirmed their first death, a 67-year-old Suleiman Achimugu.   Nigeria is Africa's largest economy, and it has a large oil industry.  It was hit hard when oil prices fell below zero in spring 2020 because of the pandemic.

Argon plasma coagulation  is the medical procedure to stop bleeding from an active bleeding site of the gastrointestinal tract. It is done with the help of endoscopy technique.	Argon plasma coagulation  is a medical endoscopic procedure used to control bleeding from certain lesions in the gastrointestinal tract . It is administered during esophagogastroduodenoscopy or colonoscopy . APC involves the use of a jet of ionized argon gas  directed through a probe passed through the endoscope . The probe is placed at some distance from the bleeding lesion, and argon gas is emitted, then ionized by a high-voltage discharge .  High-frequency electric current is then conducted through the jet of gas, resulting in coagulation of the bleeding lesion. As no physical contact is made with the lesion, the procedure is safe if the bowel has been cleaned of colonic gases,   and can be used to treat bleeding in parts of the gastrointestinal tract with thin walls, such as the cecum . The depth of coagulation is usually only a few millimetres. APC is used to treat the following conditions:	3.5998333

Arteriovenous malformation is a rare disorder . It affects the areas between arteries and veins , and bypasses the capillary system. This happens in the central nervous system , but may appear in any location. The disease can cause intense pain or bleeding or lead to other serious medical problems such as cerebral hemorrhages or strokes . AVMs are usually congenital . The genetic patterns of AVMs are incomplete, but there are known genetic mutations .  The general symptoms of a cerebral AVM include headaches and epileptic seizures . More specific symptoms occurring that normally depend on the place of the malformation.	Arteriovenous malformation is an abnormal connection between arteries and veins , bypassing the capillary system . This vascular anomaly is widely known because of its occurrence in the central nervous system , but can appear in any location. Although many AVMs are asymptomatic, they can cause intense pain or bleeding or lead to other serious medical problems. AVMs are usually congenital and belong to the RASopathies . The genetic transmission patterns of AVMs are incomplete, but there are known genetic mutations  which can lead to an increased occurrence throughout the body. Symptoms of AVM vary according to the location of the malformation. Roughly 88%  of people with an AVM are asymptomatic; often the malformation is discovered as part of an autopsy or during treatment of an unrelated disorder ; in rare cases, its expansion or a micro-bleed from an AVM in the brain can cause epilepsy, neurological deficit, or pain.	3.5843594
Veterinary medicine is a branch of medicine that deals with the health of animals . It is the study and practice of preventing, diagnosing and treating disease and injuries in animals. Veterinary medicine covers all species of animals, including both domesticated animals and wild animals. People who study and practice veterinary medicine professionally are called veterinarians . Veterinary science tries to help human health by monitoring and controlling zoonotic diseases .	Veterinary medicine is the branch of medicine that deals with the prevention, control, diagnosis, and treatment of disease, disorder, and injury in animals . Along with this, it deals with animal rearing, husbandry, breeding, research on nutrition, and product development. The scope of veterinary medicine is wide, covering all animal species, both domesticated and wild , with a wide range of conditions that can affect different species. Veterinary medicine is widely practiced, both with and without professional supervision. Professional care is most often led by a veterinary physician , but also by paraveterinary workers , such as veterinary nurses or technicians.  This can be augmented by other paraprofessionals with specific specialties, such as animal physiotherapy or dentistry , and species-relevant roles such as farriers . Veterinary science helps human health through the monitoring and control of zoonotic disease , food safety, and indirectly through human applications from basic medical research. They also help to maintain food supply through livestock health monitoring and treatment, and mental health by keeping pets healthy and long-living. Veterinary scientists often collaborate with epidemiologists and other health or natural scientists, depending on type of work. Ethically, veterinarians are usually obliged to look after animal welfare. Veterinarians diagnose, treat, and help keep animals safe and healthy.	3.576759
Female genital mutilation  is cutting off part or all of the female genitals that are outside of the body.  FGM is also called female genital cutting and female circumcision .  It is done for traditional reasons, as part of a ritual , not for medical reasons. FGM is most common in 27 African countries, as well as Yemen and Iraqi Kurdistan .  However, it also happens in other countries in Asia , the Middle East and around the world.  Usually, FGM is not done by a doctor or in a hospital .  It is often done with a razor blade or other sharp instruments, in many cases without anesthesia . Different ethnic groups do different kinds of FGM. They also do FGM at different ages.  Some groups do FGM when infants are only a few days old.  Others do it when girls reach puberty , or are older.  In about half the countries where FGM happens, most girls have FGM before they are five years old.  FGM can cause serious health problems, like infections , chronic pain , trouble getting pregnant and giving birth , bleeding so bad that it can kill.  FGM does not make a person's health better in any way. 	Female genital mutilation , also known as female genital cutting and female circumcision ,  is the ritual cutting or removal of some or all of the external female genitalia . The practice is found in Africa, Asia and the Middle East, and within communities from countries in which FGM is common. UNICEF estimated in 2016 that 200 million women living today in 30 countries—27 African countries, Indonesia, Iraqi Kurdistan and Yemen—have undergone the procedures. 	3.5664704
Adrenoleukodystrophy is a disease that is linked on the X chromosome . It is a result of fatty acid digestive enzymes not breaking up the fats . These fats build up in the brain . They damage the myelin that surrounds nerves . This can cause seizures and hyperactivity . It can also cause problems with speaking , listening and understanding verbal instructions .	Adrenoleukodystrophy  is a disease linked to the X chromosome . It is a result of fatty acid buildup caused by a defect in the very long chain of fatty acids transporter in peroxisomes, which then causes damage to the myelin sheath of the nerves , resulting in seizures and hyperactivity. Other symptoms include problems with speaking, listening, and understanding verbal instructions. In more detail, it is a disorder of peroxisomal fatty acid beta oxidation which results in the accumulation of very long chain fatty acids in tissues throughout the body.  The most severely affected tissues are the myelin in the central nervous system , the adrenal cortex , and the Leydig cells in the testes.  Clinically, ALD is a heterogeneous disorder, presenting with several distinct phenotypes , and no clear pattern of genotype -phenotype correlation.  As an X-linked disorder, ALD presents most commonly in males, however approximately 50% of heterozygote females show some symptoms later in life.  Approximately two-thirds of ALD patients will present with the childhood cerebral form of the disease, which is the most severe form.  It is characterized by normal development in early childhood, followed by rapid degeneration to a vegetative state .  The other forms of ALD vary in terms of onset and clinical severity, ranging from adrenal insufficiency to progressive paraparesis in early adulthood . ALD is caused by mutations in ABCD1 , a gene located on the X chromosome that codes for ALD, a peroxisomal membrane transporter protein.  The exact mechanism of the pathogenesis of the various forms of ALD is not known.  Biochemically, individuals with ALD show very high levels of unbranched, saturated, very long chain fatty acids, particularly cerotic acid .  The level of cerotic acid in plasma does not correlate with clinical presentation.  Treatment options for ALD are limited.  Dietary treatment is with Lorenzo's oil .  For the childhood cerebral form, stem cell transplant and gene therapy are options if the disease is detected early in the clinical course.  Adrenal insufficiency in ALD patients can be successfully treated.  ALD is the most common peroxisomal inborn error of metabolism, with an incidence estimated between 1:18,000 and 1:50,000.  It does not have a significantly higher incidence in any specific ethnic groups.	3.564913
Traditional medicine is a branch of medicine where treatment is based on knowledge passed on within certain cultures before the era of modern medicine.	Traditional medicine  comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within the folk beliefs of various societies before the era of modern medicine . The World Health Organization  defines traditional medicine as "the sum total of the knowledge, skills, and practices based on the theories, beliefs, and experiences indigenous to different cultures, whether explicable or not, used in the maintenance of health as well as in the prevention, diagnosis, improvement or treatment of physical and mental illness".  Traditional medicine is contrasted with scientific medicine . In some Asian and African countries, up to 80% of the population relies on traditional medicine for their primary health care needs.  When adopted outside its traditional culture, traditional medicine is often considered a form of alternative medicine .  Practices known as traditional medicines include traditional European medicine, traditional Chinese medicine , traditional indigenous Mayongia magic and medicine, traditional indigenous medicine of Assam and rest of NE India, nattuvaidyam , traditional Korean medicine , traditional African medicine , Ayurveda , Siddha medicine , Unani , ancient Iranian Medicine , Iranian  , Islamic medicine , Muti , and Ifá . Scientific disciplines which study traditional medicine include herbalism , ethnomedicine , ethnobotany , and medical anthropology . The WHO notes, however, that "inappropriate use of traditional medicines or practices can have negative or dangerous effects" and that " further research is needed to ascertain the efficacy and safety" of such practices and medicinal plants used by traditional medicine systems.  As a result, the WHO has implemented a nine-year strategy to "support Member States in developing proactive policies and implementing action plans that will strengthen the role traditional medicine plays in keeping populations healthy." 	3.5576227
Cerebrovascular disease , stroke or cerebrovascular accident,  is a vascular disease of the cerebral circulation . Arteries supplying oxygen to the brain are affected resulting in one of a number of cerebrovascular diseases. Most commonly this is a stroke or mini-stroke and sometimes can be a hemorrhagic stroke . Any of these can result in vascular dementia .  Causes of cerebrovascular disease can be divided into: atherosclerosis , embolism , aneurysms , low flow states, and other rare causes.  Major modifiable risk factors include:  Treatment for cerebrovascular disease includes medication , lifestyle changes and surgery .  Examples of medications are: Surgical procedures include:	Cerebrovascular disease includes a variety of medical conditions that affect the blood vessels of the brain and the cerebral circulation . Arteries supplying oxygen and nutrients to the brain are often damaged or deformed in these disorders.  The most common presentation of cerebrovascular disease is an ischemic stroke or mini-stroke and sometimes a hemorrhagic stroke .  Hypertension  is the most important contributing risk factor for stroke and cerebrovascular diseases as it can change the structure of blood vessels and result in atherosclerosis .  Atherosclerosis narrows blood vessels in the brain, resulting in decreased cerebral perfusion. Other risk factors that contribute to stroke include smoking and diabetes.  Narrowed cerebral arteries can lead to ischemic stroke , but continually elevated blood pressure can also cause tearing of vessels, leading to a hemorrhagic stroke.  A stroke usually presents with an abrupt onset of a neurologic deficit – such as hemiplegia , numbness, aphasia , or ataxia  – attributable to a focal vascular lesion.  The neurologic symptoms manifest within seconds because neurons need a continual supply of nutrients, including glucose and oxygen, that are provided by the blood. Therefore if blood supply to the brain is impeded, injury and energy failure is rapid.  Besides hypertension, there are also many less common causes of cerebrovascular disease, including those that are congenital or idiopathic and include CADASIL , aneurysms , amyloid angiopathy , arteriovenous malformations , fistulas , and arterial dissections .  Many of these diseases can be asymptomatic until an acute event, such as a stroke, occurs.  Cerebrovascular diseases can also present less commonly with headache or seizures.  Any of these diseases can result in vascular dementia due to ischemic damage to the brain.  	3.5532708
Herd immunity  is a form of protection from infectious disease . This happens when a large percentage of a population has become immune to an infection, whether through previous infections or vaccination .   When many individuals have immunity, they do not spread the disease any more. This either stops or slows the spread of disease. 	Herd immunity  is a form of indirect protection from infectious disease that can occur with some diseases when a sufficient percentage of a population has become immune to an infection, whether through vaccination or previous infections, thereby reducing the likelihood of infection for individuals who lack immunity.    Immune individuals are unlikely to contribute to disease transmission , disrupting chains of infection, which stops or slows the spread of disease.  The greater the proportion of immune individuals in a community, the smaller the probability that non-immune individuals will come into contact with an infectious individual.  Individuals can become immune by recovering from an earlier infection or through vaccination .  Some individuals cannot become immune because of medical conditions, such as an immunodeficiency or immunosuppression , and for this group herd immunity is a crucial method of protection.   Once the herd immunity threshold has been reached, disease gradually disappears from a population.  This elimination, if achieved worldwide, may result in the permanent reduction in the number of infections to zero, called eradication .  Herd immunity created via vaccination contributed to the eventual eradication of smallpox in 1977 and has contributed to the reduction of other diseases.  Herd immunity applies only to contagious disease, meaning that it is transmitted from one individual to another.  Tetanus , for example, is infectious but not contagious, so herd immunity does not apply.  Herd immunity was recognized as a naturally occurring phenomenon in the 1930s when it was observed that after a significant number of children had become immune to measles , the number of new infections temporarily decreased.  Mass vaccination to induce herd immunity has since become common and proved successful in preventing the spread of many infectious diseases.  Opposition to vaccination has posed a challenge to herd immunity, allowing preventable diseases to persist in or return to populations with inadequate vaccination rates.   	3.5530982
A midwife is a professional in midwifery . Their education and training equips them to recognise the variations of normal progress of labor, and understand how to deal with deviations from normal.	A midwife is a health professional who cares for mothers and newborns around childbirth , a specialization known as midwifery . The education and training for a midwife concentrates extensively on the care of women throughout their lifespan; concentrating on being experts in what is normal and identifying conditions that need further evaluation. In most countries, midwives are recognized as skilled healthcare providers. Midwives are trained to recognize variations from the normal progress of labor and understand how to deal with deviations from normal. They may intervene in high risk situations such as breech births , twin births , and births where the baby is in a posterior position , using non-invasive techniques. For complications related to pregnancy and birth that are beyond the midwife's scope of practice , including surgical and instrumental deliveries, they refer their patients to physicians or surgeons.   In many parts of the world, these professions work in tandem to provide care to childbearing women. In others, only the midwife is available to provide care, and in yet other countries, many women elect to utilize obstetricians primarily over midwives.	3.546212
A randomized controlled trial is a special method of doing a scientific experiment which can reduce certain  sources of bias . It is often used in the context of testing whether drugs are effective against a set of symptoms . When doing the test, the participants are randomly put into different groups. Each group is treated differently, and at the end the results are compared. A common case is that one group will receive a placebo drug, while the other will receive the real one. The trial is called blinded , if the participants, or those giving the drugs do not know what group a patient is in. Controlled studies and trials have been done for a long time. In 1753, James Lind published a study that shows that scurvy could be treated by a diet including many lemons and oranges . Ignaz Semmelweis , a Hungarian doctor in Vienna, established the term "systematic controlled observation". Semmelweis is known today because he linked an increase in childbed fever to missing hygiene in hospitals . At the end of the 19th century, the first problem of not assigning people to test groups randomly became apparent. Austin Bradford Hill established the term "randomized controlled trial" in the 1940s. He did a study regarduing the treatment of tuberculosis with Streptomycin  in the 1940s. This study is seen as thew first randomized controlled triall. 	A randomized controlled trial  is a type of scientific experiment  or intervention study  that aims to reduce certain sources of bias when testing the effectiveness of new treatments; this is accomplished by randomly allocating subjects to two or more groups, treating them differently, and then comparing them with respect to a measured response. One group—the experimental group—receives the intervention being assessed, while the other—usually called the control group—receives an alternative treatment, such as a placebo or no intervention. The groups are monitored under conditions of the trial design to determine the effectiveness of the experimental intervention, and efficacy is assessed in comparison to the control.  There may be more than one treatment group or more than one control group . The trial may be blinded , meaning that information which may influence the participants is withheld until after the experiment is complete. A blind can be imposed on any participant of an experiment, including subjects, researchers, technicians, data analysts, and evaluators. Effective blinding may reduce or eliminate some sources of experimental bias . The randomness in the assignment of subjects to groups reduces selection bias and allocation bias, balancing both known and unknown prognostic factors, in the assignment of treatments.  Blinding reduces other forms of experimenter and subject biases .	3.5434272
The Apgar score is used in medicine .  It is a quick way of measuring how healthy a newborn baby is. Virginia Apgar invented the Apgar score in 1952.   She was an anesthesiologist , and created the score to measure how babies were affected by anesthesia given to their mothers during childbirth . Today, the Apgar score is very commonly used by doctors , nurses , midwives , emergency medical technicians , and other medical professionals.  One of the reasons it is so popular is that doing an Apgar test is very quick.  It usually takes less than a minute, sometimes just seconds.  When an Apgar test is done, five simple things about the newborn baby are checked.  The newborn gets a score of 0, 1, or 2 on each of these give things.  The scores are added up, and the total is the newborn's Apgar score.	The Apgar score is a method to quickly summarize the health of newborn children against infant mortality .   Virginia Apgar , an anesthesiologist at New York–Presbyterian Hospital , developed the score in 1952 to quantify the effects of obstetric anesthesia on babies.  The Apgar score is determined by evaluating the newborn baby on five simple criteria on a scale from zero to two, then summing up the five values thus obtained. The resulting score ranges from zero to 10.  The five criteria are summarized using words chosen to form a backronym : appearance, pulse, grimace, activity, respiration.  The test is generally done at 1 and 5 minutes after birth and may be repeated later if the score is and remains low. Scores of 7 and above are generally normal; 4 to 6, fairly low; and 3 and below are generally regarded as critically low and cause for immediate resuscitative efforts. 	3.521589
Chordoma is a slow growing, very rare kind of cancerous tumor .	Chordoma is a rare slow-growing neoplasm thought to arise from cellular remnants of the notochord . The evidence for this is the location of the tumors , the similar immunohistochemical staining patterns, and the demonstration that notochordal cells are preferentially left behind in the clivus and sacrococcygeal regions when the remainder of the notochord regresses during fetal life. In layman's terms, chordoma is a type of spinal cancer.  Chordomas can arise from bone in the skull base and anywhere along the spine. The two most common locations are cranially at the clivus and in the sacrum at the bottom of the spine. 	3.519871
Adenoidectomy is the process of taking out a person's adenoids from the back of their throat through the process of surgery . They may be removed for several reasons, including difficulty breathing through the nose and having ear infections. The surgery is common in young kids. The procedure is usually performed using a substance called anaesthesia , and the substance puts a person to sleep when it is applied. Recovery time from the operation can vary from several hours to a few days. Adenoidectomy is usually done on young children because their adenoids were infected by a virus . If the disease was to be left alone, it would worsen. The affected person could have harder times breathing or hearing, and may possibly be killed from the disease. Normally functioning adenoids help maintain the body's healthy immune system during early childhood. They shrink when a person gets older. When a person becomes an adult , their adenoids completely disappear.	Adenoidectomy is the surgical removal of the adenoid for reasons which include impaired breathing through the nose, chronic infections, or recurrent earaches. The effectiveness of removing the adenoids in children to improve recurrent nasal symptoms and/or nasal obstruction has not been well studied.  The surgery is less commonly performed in adults in whom the adenoid is much smaller and less active than it is in children. It is most often done on an outpatient basis under general anesthesia . Post-operative pain is generally minimal and reduced by icy or cold foods. The procedure is often combined with tonsillectomy , for which the recovery time is an estimated 10-14 days, sometimes longer, mostly dependent on age. Adenoidectomy is not often performed under one year of age as adenoid function is part of the body's immune system but its contribution to this decreases progressively beyond this age. The indications for adenoidectomy are still controversial.    Widest agreement surrounds the removal of the adenoid for obstructive sleep apnea, usually combined with tonsillectomy.  Even then, it has been observed that a significant percentage of the study population  did not respond. There is also support for adenoidectomy in recurrent otitis media in children previously treated with tympanostomy tubes .  Finally, the effectiveness of adenoidectomy in children with recurrent upper respiratory tract infections, common cold, otitis media and moderate nasal obstruction has been questioned with the outcome,  in some studies, being no better than watchful waiting.  	3.5131328
A beating heart cadaver is the body of a dead person that has been connected to a medical ventilator. This will keep the organs of the dead body, including the heart , functioning and alive for a few days.  Such a body still functions physically, but the person it belonged to is dead by the law and medicine 's definition because there is no longer any conscious brain function possible. The procedure for caring for a beating heart cadaver is the same as caring for a normal patient. The body must be monitored at all times, and if necessary, "life saving" procedures must be taken. Since the brain does not work, the hormone levels and blood pressure must be controlled by doctors to keep the organs alive. Measures must be taken to prevent infection and maintain normal tissue oxygenation .  A beating heart cadaver is kept alive in order to keep its organs from decaying before they can be transplanted. Surgeons will remove the organs, one after the other, and give them to their patients.  The entire recovery process is usually completed within four hours.  This process was formerly known as an "Organ Harvest", but the name has since changed to the milder "Organ Recovery."  Many organs can be used, and many lives can be saved by one body.  The bodies are generally organ donors , who have agreed beforehand to donate their organs.  Some donated organs are taken from non-heart-beating donors .  Organs from brain deaths , however, have a better success rate, and currently most organ donation is from these deaths.  A beating heart cadaver is often disturbing and confusing. Because the heart is beating and the body is warm, people may have difficulty believing it is dead.  Families often like to see the body once it has been removed from the machines and put to rest. 	A beating heart cadaver is a body that is pronounced dead in all medical and legal definitions, connected to a medical ventilator , and retains cardio-pulmonary functions. This keeps the organs of the body, including the heart , functioning and alive.  As a result, the period of time in which the organs may be used for transplantation is extended. The heart contains pacemaker cells that will cause it to continue beating even when a patient is brain-dead . Other organs in the body do not have this capability and need the brain to be functioning to send signals to the organs to carry out their functions. A beating heart cadaver requires a ventilator to provide oxygen to its blood, but the heart will continue to beat on its own even in the absence of brain activity.  This allows organs to be preserved for a longer period of time in the case of a transplant or donation. A small number of cases in recent years indicate that it can also be implemented for a brain-dead pregnant woman to reach the full term of her pregnancy.  There is an advantage to beating heart cadaver organ donation because doctors are able to see the vitals of the organs and tell if they are stable and functioning before transplanting to an ailing patient.  This is not possible in a donation from someone pronounced dead. The observed phenomena of lifelike qualities after death is not a new concept. In René Descartes ' Discourse on the Method , he notes that decapitated animals move and display characteristics of a living body a few seconds after decapitation which was published in 1637.  This continued into the French Revolution where it was observed that people who had been beheaded showed movements in facial muscles and hearts could continue to beat for almost an hour past the time of beheading.  The guillotine in some cases did not completely sever head from body. In 1875 an examiner named Pierre Jean Cabanis was assigned the duty of making sure a body was truly dead.  There were also stories involving beheadings where the victims would stand up and walk around before falling dead. The ambiguity around brain death and true death has followed it to present day. In an effort to clarify some of these gray areas, the Harvard Medical Committee developed criteria for identifying a body as dead in 1968.   These criteria required patients to be completely unaware and unresponsive to external stimuli, have no spontaneous muscle movements, and exhibit no reflexive response even when manipulated. They also required that an electroencephalography  show no signs of activity.  The purpose of this report was to encourage physicians to distinguish brain death and irreversible coma from a persistent vegetative state where the patient still has some awareness and cycles through sleep and wakefulness.  In 1971 a similar Minnesota criteria was published eliminating the EEG, repeating the exam after 12 hours, a severe lesion in the brain, and increasing the duration of the apnea test to four minutes rather than Harvard's three minute guideline. Other slight changes in the next decades included the United Kingdom's decision to eliminate the repetition of the exam and change from a duration of the apnea test to specified levels of CO 2 in 1976.  Later, in 1981 the President's Commission reinstated the apnea test and the repeat exam. In a study done in 1989, only 35% of 195 physicians and nurses involved in organ procurement polled knew brain death criteria. These were not the same nurses and physicians who diagnose brain death. Presently, there is hot debate over the protocol for diagnosing someone as brain dead due to widespread disinformation and misinformation on the internet. 	3.511339
A phantom smell or olfactory hallucination is smelling an odor that is not actually there. It is also called phantosmia. It can occur in one nostril or both. Phantosmia with unpleasant smells, which is called cacosmia, is more common. It is often described as smelling something that is burned, foul, spoiled, or rotten. Experiencing phantom smells from time to time is normal and usually goes away on its own.  When hallucinations of this type do not seem to go away or when they keep coming back, this can be very upsetting and can lower an individual's quality of life.  Common medical conditions such as nasal infections, nasal polyps, or dental problems can cause phantom smells. A phantom smell can also result from neurological conditions such as migraines , head injuries, strokes , Parkinson's disease , seizures , or brain tumors . It can also be a symptom of certain mental disorders such as depression , bipolar disorder , intoxication or withdrawal from  drugs and alcohol, or psychotic disorders . Certain substances in the environment can also cause phantom smells. These include tobacco smoke, certain types of chemicals , or radiation treatment for head or neck cancer. A physician can determine if the problem is with the sense of smell  or taste , or if it is caused by a neurological or psychiatric disorder. Phantosmia usually goes away on its own. Sometimes this occurs step by step. The process can take several years. When a phantom smell is caused by an illness , it should go away with theillness. If the problem persists or causes significant discomfort, a doctor might recommend nasal saline drops, antidepressant or anticonvulsant medications, anesthesia to parts of the nose, or in very rare circumstances, surgical procedures to remove the olfactory nerves or bulbs .	Phantosmia , also called an olfactory hallucination or a phantom odor ,  is smelling an odor that is not actually there. It can occur in one nostril or both.  Unpleasant phantosmia, cacosmia , is more common and is often described as smelling something that is burned, foul, spoiled, or rotten.  Experiencing occasional phantom smells is normal and usually goes away on its own in time.  When hallucinations of this type do not seem to go away or when they keep coming back, it can be very upsetting and can disrupt an individual's quality of life.  Olfactory hallucinations can be caused by common medical conditions such as nasal infections, nasal polyps , or dental problems. It can result from neurological conditions such as migraines, head injuries, strokes, Parkinson's disease , seizures , or brain tumors.  It can also be a symptom of certain mental disorders such as depression , bipolar disorder , intoxication or withdrawal from  drugs and alcohol, or psychotic disorders .  Environmental exposures are sometimes the cause as well, such as smoking, exposure to certain types of chemicals , or radiation treatment for head or neck cancer.  A physician can determine if the problem is with the sense of smell  or taste , or if it is caused by a neurological or psychiatric disorder. Phantosmia usually goes away on its own, though this can sometimes be gradual and occur over several years.  When caused by an illness , it should go away when the illness resolves.  If the problem persists or causes significant discomfort, a doctor might recommend nasal saline drops, antidepressant or anticonvulsant medications, anesthesia to parts of the nose, or in very rare circumstances, surgical procedures to remove the olfactory nerves or bulbs .  	3.5112174
Breast augmentation is a surgical procedure used to increase the size of the breasts . Usually, implants are used, but another technique called fat grafting is sometimes used. The size increase can be as small as one cup size, or as large as 10 cup sizes or more. The larger the increase, the greater the risk of complications . Complications may include leaking of the implants, which may require the implants to be replaced. With larger breasts the whole weight balance of the body is changed, which may cause stress to the muscular and skeletal systems. A surgical implant is either an implant filled with saline -solution, or an implant filled with silicone -gel. The fat-graft transfer uses grafts of adipose fat tissue from the woman’s own body. A full assessment of this method is not yet available. The method does not allow for the huge size increase possible with implants, and slim women may not have enough fat tissue to allow the method to be used.	Breast augmentation and augmentation mammoplasty  is a cosmetic surgery technique using breast-implants and fat-graft mammoplasty techniques to increase the size, change the shape, and alter the texture of the breasts of a woman. Augmentation mammoplasty is applied to correct congenital defects of the breasts and the chest wall.  As an elective cosmetic surgery, primary augmentation changes the aesthetics – of size, shape, and texture – of healthy breasts.  The surgical implantation approach creates a spherical augmentation of the breast hemisphere, using a breast implant filled with either saline solution or silicone gel ; the fat-graft transfer approach augments the size and corrects contour defects of the breast hemisphere with grafts of the adipocyte fat tissue , drawn from the person's body. In a breast reconstruction procedure, a tissue expander  is sometimes put in place and inflated with saline to prepare  the recipient site  to receive and accommodate the breast implant prosthesis.	3.5033433
Alprazolam , probably better known by its trade name Xanax , is a short-acting drug. The drug is used to treat people with anxiety disorders and panic attacks . Alprazolam is the most commonly misused benzodiazepine  in the United States ; but the majority of prescribed users do not develop a substance-use disorder. Alprazolam is a prescription drug in the United States.	Alprazolam , sold under the brand name Xanax , among others, is a short-acting tranquilizer of the triazolobenzodiazepine  class, which are benzodiazepines  fused with a triazole ring.  It is most commonly used in short-term management of anxiety disorders , specifically panic disorder or generalized anxiety disorder .  Other uses include the treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea , together with other treatments.  GAD improvement occurs generally within a week.   Alprazolam is generally taken by mouth .  Common side effects include sleepiness, depression, headaches, feeling tired, dry mouth , and memory problems .  Some of the sedation and tiredness may improve within a few days.  Due to concerns about misuse, some do not recommend alprazolam as an initial treatment for panic disorder.  Withdrawal or rebound symptoms may occur if use is suddenly decreased;  gradually decreasing the dose over weeks or months may be required.  Other rare risks include suicide , possibly due to loss of inhibition .  Alprazolam, like other benzodiazepines, acts through the GABA A receptor . 	3.4789536

Schizophreniform disorder is a mental illness . Usually, people suffering from this disorder show certain symptoms of schizophrenia , but they do not have all of them, or the symptoms are not present long enough. To be recognised as schizophrenia, the symptoms need to be present a full six months. If symptoms are not present for that time period, the illness may be classified as shizophreniform disorder. The disorder can be treated in much the same way as schizophrenia. There are certain antipsychotic drugs and therapies that can help treat the symptoms.	Schizophreniform disorder is a mental disorder diagnosed when symptoms of schizophrenia are present for a significant portion of time , but signs of disturbance are not present for the full six months required for the diagnosis of schizophrenia. The symptoms of both disorders can include delusions , hallucinations , disorganized speech , disorganized or catatonic behavior , and social withdrawal . While impairment in social, occupational, or academic functioning is required for the diagnosis of schizophrenia, in schizophreniform disorder an individual's level of functioning may or may not be affected. While the onset of schizophrenia is often gradual over a number of months or years, the onset of schizophreniform disorder can be relatively rapid. Like schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder is often treated with antipsychotic medications , especially the atypicals , along with a variety of social supports  designed to reduce the social and emotional impact of the illness. The prognosis varies depending upon the nature, severity, and duration of the symptoms, but about two-thirds of individuals diagnosed with schizophreniform disorder go on to develop schizophrenia. 	3.4396706
In medicine , an acute disease or condition either happens for a short time, as in acute infection , or doesn't last long. The word acute may often be confused by the general public to mean ' severe '. This is different: something can be acute but not severe. The word acute is in the name of many diseases, for example, severe acute respiratory syndrome or acute leukemia . Acute hospitals are hospitals which are meant for short-term medical and/or surgical treatment and care. The related medical speciality is called acute medicine . Subacute is described as between acute and chronic. An example is subacute fever symptoms or subacute endocarditis .	In medicine , describing a disease as acute denotes that it is of short duration and, as a corollary of that, of recent onset . The quantification of how much time constitutes "short" and "recent" varies by disease and by context, but the core denotation of "acute" is always qualitatively in contrast with " chronic ", which denotes long-lasting disease . In addition, "acute" also often connotes two other meanings: sudden onset and severity , such as in acute myocardial infarction , where suddenness and severity are both established aspects of the meaning. It thus often connotes that the condition is fulminant , but not always . The one thing that acute MI and acute rhinitis have in common is that they are not chronic. They can happen again , but they are not the same case ongoing for months or years . A noncount sense of "acute disease" refers to the acute phase, that is, a short course, of any disease entity.   For example, in an article on ulcerative enteritis in poultry , the author says, "in acute disease there may be increased mortality without any obvious signs ",  referring to the acute form or phase of ulcerative enteritis. Not all acute diseases or injuries are severe, and vice versa. For example, a mild stubbed toe is an acute injury. Similarly, many acute upper respiratory infections and acute gastroenteritis cases in adults are mild and usually resolve within a few days or weeks.	3.4319947

Central nervous system diseases , also known as central nervous system disorders , are a group of neurological disorders that affect the structure or function of the brain or spinal cord . They form the central nervous system .   	Central nervous system diseases , also known as central nervous system disorders , are a group of neurological disorders that affect the structure or function of the brain or spinal cord , which collectively form the central nervous system .    Every disease has different signs and symptoms . Some of them are persistent headache; pain in the face, back, arms, or legs; an inability to concentrate; loss of feeling; memory loss; loss of muscle strength; tremors ; seizures; increased reflexes, spasticity, tics; paralysis; and slurred speech . One should seek medical attention if affected by these. Any type of traumatic brain injury  or injury done to the spinal cord can result in a wide spectrum of disabilities in a person. Depending on the section of the brain or spinal cord that suffers the trauma, the outcome may be anticipated.	3.4244068
Catalepsy is a nervous condition. The body is fixed, with rigid muscles and fixed posture . The body position does not respond to stimuli , and there is  decreased sensitivity to pain .  Catalepsy is a symptom of certain nervous disorders or conditions such as Parkinson's disease and epilepsy . It is also a characteristic symptom of cocaine withdrawal. It may be caused by schizophrenia treatment with anti-psychotics such as haloperidol .   It may be caused by the anaesthetic ketamine .  In some cases, catalepsy may be started by  an extreme emotional shock – one well known example of this was the reaction of 1968 Olympic long jump medalist Bob Beamon on finding he had broken the previous world record by over 0.5 meters .  Protein kinase A has been suggested as a mediator of cataleptic behavior. 	Catalepsy  is a nervous condition characterized by muscular rigidity and fixity of posture regardless of external stimuli, as well as decreased sensitivity to pain .  Symptoms include a rigid body, rigid limbs, limbs staying in same position when moved , no response, loss of muscle control, and slowing down of bodily functions, such as breathing.  Catalepsy is a symptom of certain nervous disorders or conditions such as Parkinson's disease and epilepsy . It is also a characteristic symptom of cocaine withdrawal, as well as one of the features of catatonia .  It can be caused by schizophrenia treatment with anti-psychotics ,  such as haloperidol ,  and by the anesthetic ketamine .  Protein kinase A has been suggested as a mediator of cataleptic behavior.  Unsuggested waxy catalepsy, sometimes accompanied by spontaneous anesthesia, is seen as an indicator of hypnotic trance.  Suggested or induced rigid catalepsy, of extended limbs or even the entire body, sometimes tested with heavy weights, has been a staple of stage hypnosis shows and even academic demonstrations of hypnotism since the late 18th century, as proof of extraordinary physical abilities possible in trance states.  Such demonstrations have also been performed by Asian martial artists to prove the presence of "ki" or "chi" power, a kind of psychological or spiritual resource. 	3.4109645
Dermatology is a branch of medicine that deals with skin , hair, sweat glands, etc. Dermatologists are doctors who diagnose and treat diseases and tumors of the skin, hair, and sweat glands.	Dermatology is the branch of medicine dealing with the skin .   It is a speciality with both medical and surgical aspects.    A dermatologist is a specialist medical doctor who manages diseases related to skin, hair, nails, and some cosmetic problems.   Attested in English in 1819, the word "dermatology" derives from the Greek δέρματος , genitive of δέρμα , "skin"   and -λογία -logia . Neo-Latin dermatologia was coined in 1630, an anatomical term with various French and German uses attested from the 1730s. 	3.4097898
Dextromethorphan  is a drug . It is used to prevent coughs in many over-the-counter cold and cough medicines. Dextromethorphan can also be used for pain relief or for psychological conditions. It is sold in syrup , tablet , and lozenge forms, manufactured under several different brand names and generic labels. In its pure form, dextromethorphan is a white powder. If more is taken than directed, dextromethorphan acts as a dissociative hallucinogenic drug. Its mechanism of action  is as an NMDA receptor antagonist , producing  effects similar to those of the controlled substances ketamine and phencyclidine . 	Dextromethorphan , often referred to as DXM , is a medication most often used as a cough suppressant in over-the-counter cold and cough medicines. It is sold in syrup , tablet, spray, and lozenge forms. It is in the morphinan class of medications with sedative , dissociative , and stimulant properties . Dextromethorphan does not have a significant affinity for the mu-opioid receptor activity typical of morphinan compounds and exerts its therapeutic effects through several other receptors.  In its pure form, dextromethorphan occurs as a white powder.  Dextromethorphan is also used recreationally . When exceeding approved dosages, dextromethorphan acts as a dissociative hallucinogen . It has multiple mechanisms of action , including actions as a nonselective serotonin reuptake inhibitor  and a sigma-1 receptor agonist.   Dextromethorphan and its major metabolite , dextrorphan , also block the NMDA receptor at high doses, which produces effects similar to other dissociative anesthetics such as ketamine , nitrous oxide , and phencyclidine . It was patented in 1949 and approved for medical use in 1953. 	3.4056091
Oxygen therapy , also called supplemental oxygen , is when oxygen gas  is used for medical treatment by giving the gas to the patient for inhalation .  It can be used for ilnesses like hypoxia , carbon monoxide toxicity , and cluster headaches .  It can be used over a long time for people who suffer with illnesses that lower oxygen levels in the blood like COPD and cystic fibrosis .  It can be given in a few different ways such as through a nasal cannula , face mask , or inside a hyperbaric chamber .   Oxygen levels need to be high enough for respiration to keep a patient healthy and for normal cell metabolism . 	Oxygen therapy , also known as supplemental oxygen , is the use of oxygen as a medical treatment .  This can include for low blood oxygen , carbon monoxide toxicity , cluster headaches , and to maintain enough oxygen while inhaled anesthetics are given.  Long-term oxygen is often useful in people with chronically low oxygen such as from severe COPD or cystic fibrosis .   Oxygen can be given in a number of ways including nasal cannula , face mask , and inside a hyperbaric chamber .   Oxygen is required for normal cell metabolism .  Excessively high concentrations can cause oxygen toxicity such as lung damage or result in respiratory failure in those who are predisposed.   Higher oxygen concentrations also increase the risk of fires, particularly while smoking, and without humidification can also dry out the nose.  The target oxygen saturation recommended depends on the condition being treated.  In most conditions a saturation of 94–96% is recommended, while in those at risk of carbon dioxide retention saturations of 88–92% are preferred, and in those with carbon monoxide toxicity or cardiac arrest they should be as high as possible.   Air is typically 21% oxygen by volume while oxygen therapy increases this by some amount up to 100%.  The use of oxygen in medicine became common around 1917.   It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines .  The cost of home oxygen is about US$150 a month in Brazil and US$400 a month in the United States.  Home oxygen can be provided either by oxygen tanks or an oxygen concentrator .  Oxygen is believed to be the most common treatment given in hospitals in the developed world .  	3.399802

Clear cell sarcoma of the soft tissues in adults is not related to the pediatric tumor known as clear cell sarcoma of the kidney . 	Clear cell sarcoma is a rare form of cancer called a sarcoma .  It is known to occur mainly in the soft tissues and dermis. Rare forms were thought to occur in the gastrointestinal tract before they were discovered to be different and redesignated as GNET . Recurrence is common.  It has been associated with both EWSR1 - ATF1 and EWSR1 - CREB1 fusion transcripts. 	3.3972766
A blood film or peripheral blood smear is a thin layer of blood smeared on a microscope slide and then stained in such a way to allow the various blood cells to be examined microscopically. Blood films are usually examined to investigate disorders of the blood and, occasionally, to look for parasites within the blood such as malaria and filaria. 	A blood film —or peripheral blood smear —is a thin layer of blood smeared on a glass microscope slide and then stained in such a way as to allow the various blood cells to be examined microscopically. Blood films are examined in the investigation of hematological  disorders and  are routinely employed to look for blood parasites , such as those of malaria and filariasis . Blood films are made by placing a drop of blood on one end of a slide, and using a spreader slide to disperse the blood over the slide's length. The aim is to get a region, called a monolayer, where the cells are spaced far enough apart to be counted and differentiated. The monolayer is found in the "feathered edge" created by the spreader slide as it draws the blood forward. The slide is left to air dry, after which the blood is fixed to the slide by immersing it briefly in methanol . The fixative is essential for good staining and presentation of cellular detail. After fixation, the slide is stained to distinguish the cells from each other.	3.395539
Bupropion is an antidepressant .  It is also used to help people quit smoking .  It is marketed as Wellbutrin.	Bupropion , sold under the brand names Wellbutrin and Zyban among others, is an atypical antidepressant primarily used to treat major depressive disorder and to support smoking cessation .   Bupropion is an effective antidepressant on its own, but it is also popular as an add-on medication in the cases of incomplete response to the first-line selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor  antidepressant.   Bupropion has several features that distinguish it from other antidepressants: it does not usually cause sexual dysfunction;  it is not associated with weight gain  and sleepiness ,  and it is more effective than SSRIs at improving symptoms of hypersomnia and fatigue.  Common adverse effects of bupropion with the greatest difference from placebo are dry mouth, nausea, constipation, insomnia, anxiety, tremor, and excessive sweating.  Raised blood pressure is notable.  Rare but serious side effects include seizure ,  liver toxicity ,  psychosis ,  and risk of overdose.  Bupropion use during pregnancy may be associated with increased odds of congenital heart defects . 	3.3895543
Medical microbiology , also known as ‘’’clinical microbiology’’’, is the study of microbes , such as bacteria , viruses , fungi and parasites , which cause human illness and their role in the disease. The microbes and the branch of microbiology are the most studied due to their great importance to medicine .  Medical microbiology studies development and progress of the infectious disease in a patient and in human population . It is related to the study of disease pathology and immunology . It is a branch of medicine and microbiology and includes five sciences: bacteriology , virology , parasitology , immunology and mycology . In 1546, Girolamo Fracastoro proposed that epidemic diseases were caused by transferable seed like entities through direct, indirect contact and contact over long distances with an infection .	Medical microbiology , the large subset of microbiology that is applied to medicine , is a branch of medical science concerned with the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases .  In addition, this field of science studies various clinical applications of microbes for the improvement of health.  There are four kinds of microorganisms that cause infectious disease: bacteria , fungi , parasites and viruses , and one type of infectious protein called prion . A medical microbiologist studies the characteristics of pathogens , their modes of transmission, mechanisms of infection and growth. The academic qualification as a clinical/Medical Microbiologist in a hospital or medical research centre generally requires a Masters in Microbiology along with Ph.D. in any of the life-sciences .  Using this information, a treatment can be devised.  Medical microbiologists often serve as consultants for physicians , providing identification of pathogens and suggesting treatment options. Other tasks may include the identification of potential health risks to the community or monitoring the evolution of potentially virulent or resistant strains of microbes, educating the community and assisting in the design of health practices.  They may also assist in preventing or controlling epidemics and outbreaks of disease. Not all medical microbiologists study microbial pathology ; some study common, non-pathogenic species to determine whether their properties can be used to develop antibiotics or other treatment methods. Epidemiology , the study of the patterns, causes, and effects of health and disease conditions in populations, is an important part of medical microbiology, although the clinical aspect of the field primarily focuses on the presence and growth of microbial infections in individuals, their effects on the human body, and the methods of treating those infections. In this respect the entire field, as an applied science, can be conceptually subdivided into academic and clinical sub-specialties, although in reality there is a fluid continuum between public health microbiology and clinical microbiology , just as the state of the art in clinical laboratories depends on continual improvements in academic medicine and research laboratories .	3.38334
Acute myeloid leukemia , also known as acute myelogenous leukemia or acute nonlymphocytic leukemia , is a cancer of the myeloid line of blood cells. It is the rapid growth of uncommon white blood cells that build up in the bone marrow and harm the production of normal blood cells . AML is the most common acute leukemia affecting adults.	Acute myeloid leukemia  is a cancer of the myeloid line of blood cells , characterized by the rapid growth of abnormal cells that build up in the bone marrow and blood and interfere with normal blood cell production .  Symptoms may include feeling tired, shortness of breath , easy bruising and bleeding, and increased risk of infection .  Occasionally, spread may occur to the brain, skin, or gums.  As an acute leukemia , AML progresses rapidly and is typically fatal within weeks or months if left untreated.   Risk factors include smoking , previous chemotherapy or radiation therapy , myelodysplastic syndrome , and exposure to the chemical benzene .  The underlying mechanism involves replacement of normal bone marrow with leukemia cells , which results in a drop in red blood cells , platelets , and normal white blood cells .  Diagnosis is generally based on bone marrow aspiration and specific blood tests .  AML has several subtypes for which treatments and outcomes may vary. 	3.37381

Genetic screening in a broader sense includes biochemical tests for the possible presence of genetic diseases, or mutant forms of genes associated with increased risk of developing genetic disorders. Most of the time, testing is used to find changes that are associated with inherited disorders. The results of a genetic test can confirm or rule out a suspected genetic condition or help determine a person's chance of developing or passing on a genetic disorder . Several hundred genetic tests are currently in use, and more are being developed.   Since genetic testing may open up ethical or psychological problems, genetic testing is often accompanied by genetic counselling .	Genetic testing , also known as DNA testing , is used to identify changes in DNA sequence or chromosome structure. Genetic testing can also include measuring the results of genetic changes, such as RNA analysis as an output of gene expression , or through biochemical analysis to measure specific protein output.  In a medical setting, genetic testing can be used to diagnose or rule out suspected genetic disorders, predict risks for specific conditions, or gain information that can be used to customize medical treatments based on an individual's genetic makeup.  Genetic testing can also be used to determine biological relatives, such as a child's parentage  through DNA paternity testing ,  or be used to broadly predict an individual's ancestry .  Genetic testing of plants and animals can be used for similar reasons as in humans ,  to gain information used for selective breeding ,  or for efforts to boost genetic diversity in endangered populations.  The variety of genetic tests has expanded throughout the years. Early forms of genetic testing which began in the 1950s involved counting the number of chromosomes per cell. Deviations from the expected number of chromosomes  could lead to a diagnosis of certain genetic conditions such as trisomy 21  or monosomy X .  In the 1970s, a method to stain specific regions of chromosomes, called chromosome banding , was developed that allowed more detailed analysis of chromosome structure and diagnosis of genetic disorders that involved large structural rearrangements.  In addition to analyzing whole chromosomes , genetic testing has expanded to include the fields of molecular genetics and genomics which can identify changes at the level of individual genes, parts of genes, or even single nucleotide "letters" of DNA sequence.  According to the National Institutes of Health , there are tests available for more than 2,000 genetic conditions,  and one study estimated that as of 2017 there were more than 75,000 genetic tests on the market.  Genetic testing is "the analysis of chromosomes , proteins, and certain metabolites in order to detect heritable disease-related genotypes , mutations , phenotypes , or karyotypes for clinical purposes."  It can provide information about a person 's genes and chromosomes throughout life.	3.3703444
The COVID-19 pandemic was first detected in the U.S. state of New York in February 2020.	The first case of COVID-19 in the U.S. state of New York during the pandemic was confirmed on March 1, 2020,  and the state quickly became an epicenter of the pandemic, with a record 12,274 new cases reported on April 4 and approximately 29,000 more deaths reported for the month of April than the same month in 2019.  By April 10, New York had more confirmed cases than any country outside the US.  As of March 2, 2021  , the state has reported 35 million tests,  with 1,650,560 cumulative cases, and 47,247 deaths.  New York had the highest number of confirmed cases of any state from the start of U.S. outbreak until July 22, when it was first surpassed by California and later by Florida , Texas ,   and Illinois . Approximately half of the state's cases have been in New York City ,  where nearly half the state's population lives.	3.3666327

Cardiology  is a medical field that deals with disorders of the heart and blood vessels . Physicians in this field are called cardiologists. Cardiologists are different from cardiac surgeons who do cardiac surgery .	Cardiology  is a branch of medicine that deals with the disorders of the heart as well as some parts of the circulatory system . The field includes medical diagnosis and treatment of congenital heart defects , coronary artery disease , heart failure , valvular heart disease and electrophysiology . Physicians who specialize in this field of medicine are called cardiologists , a specialty of internal medicine . Pediatric cardiologists are pediatricians who specialize in cardiology. Physicians who specialize in cardiac surgery are called cardiothoracic surgeons or cardiac surgeons , a specialty of general surgery . All cardiologists study the disorders of the heart, but the study of adult and child heart disorders are through different training pathways. Therefore, an adult cardiologist  is inadequately trained to take care of children, and pediatric cardiologists are not trained to take care of adult heart disease. The surgical aspects are not included in cardiology and are in the domain of cardiothoracic surgery . For example, coronary artery bypass surgery , cardiopulmonary bypass and valve replacement are surgical procedures performed by surgeons, not cardiologists. However, the insertion of stents and pacemakers is performed by cardiologists.  Cardiology is a specialty of internal medicine . To be a cardiologist in the United States , a three-year residency in internal medicine is followed by a three-year fellowship in cardiology. It is possible to specialize further in a sub-specialty. Recognized sub-specialties in the United States by the ACGME are cardiac electrophysiology , echocardiography , interventional cardiology , and nuclear cardiology . Recognized subspecialties in the United States by the American Osteopathic Association Bureau of Osteopathic Specialists  include clinical cardiac electrophysiology and interventional cardiology .   While in India, a person needs to undergo three years of residency in General Medicine or Pediatrics after M.B.B.S and then three years of residency in Cardiology to be a D.M/ Diplomate of National Board  in Cardiology. 	3.3663855
The word fistula comes from a Latin word that means tube or pipe . In medicine , a fistula is an abnormal connection between two hollow spaces. This can be blood vessels , intestines , or other hollow organs . Fistulas are usually caused by injury or surgery . But they can also result from an infection or inflammation .  Fistulas are generally a disease condition, but doctors may create fistulas by surgery for medical reasons. Treatment for fistula depends on the reason for the fistula and on how serious it is.  Doctors often treat fistula with surgery and antibiotics . The first step in treating a fistula is usually an examination by a doctor.  The doctor determines the size and "path" that the fistula takes in the body.	A fistula  is an abnormal connection between two hollow spaces , such as blood vessels , intestines , or other hollow organs .    Types of fistula can be described by their location. Anal fistulas connect between the anal canal and the perianal skin. Anovaginal or rectovaginal fistulas occur when a hole develops between the anus or rectum and the vagina . Colovaginal fistulas occur between the colon and the vagina. Urinary tract fistulas are abnormal openings within the urinary tract or an abnormal connection between the urinary tract and another organ such as between the bladder and the uterus in a vesicouterine fistula, between the bladder and the vagina in a vesicovaginal fistula, and between the urethra and the vagina in urethrovaginal fistula. When occurring between two parts of the intestine, it is known as an enteroenteral fistula, between the small intestine and the skin as an enterocutaneous fistula, and between the small intestine and the colon as a colocutaneous fistula.  Fistulas can result from an infection or inflammation, injury or surgery.  Fistulas are sometimes purposefully surgically created as part of a treatment, for example arteriovenous fistulas for hemodialysis . 	3.3566487
Excessive daytime sleepiness  is a medical condition where people often feel sleepy during the day, even though they had enough sleep at night. EDS occurs with many sleep disorders . It is a defining feature of some sleep disorders such as narcolepsy , sleep apnea or Circadian rhythm sleep disorder . EDS is difficult to treat without knowing its causse. There are certain drugs that can help with EDS. In general, many treatments of the underlying disease  will also take into account EDS. The drugs which can treat EDS are usually stimulants .	Excessive daytime sleepiness is characterized by persistent sleepiness and often a general lack of energy, even during the day after apparently adequate or even prolonged nighttime sleep. EDS can be considered as a broad condition encompassing several sleep disorders where increased sleep is a symptom, or as a symptom of another underlying disorder like narcolepsy , circadian rhythm sleep disorder , sleep apnea or idiopathic hypersomnia . Some persons with EDS, including those with hypersomnias like narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia , are compelled to nap repeatedly during the day; fighting off increasingly strong urges to sleep during inappropriate times such as while driving, while at work, during a meal, or in conversations. As the compulsion to sleep intensifies, the ability to complete tasks sharply diminishes, often mimicking the appearance of intoxication. During occasional unique and/or stimulating circumstances, a person with EDS can sometimes remain animated, awake and alert, for brief or extended periods of time.  EDS can affect the ability to function in family, social, occupational, or other settings. A proper diagnosis of the underlying cause and ultimately treatment of symptoms and/or the underlying cause can help mitigate such complications.  EDS can be a symptom of a number of factors and disorders. Specialists in sleep medicine are trained to diagnose them. Some are:	3.3550324
A central venous catheter  or " central line " is a catheter put in a large vein in the neck , chest , or groin when a patient needs close cardiovascular monitoring, for assessment of fluid status, and so that intravenous drugs and fluids can be given to the patient more effectively.  The veins most commonly used are the internal jugular vein , the subclavian vein , and the femoral vein .	A central venous catheter , also known as a central line , central venous line, or central venous access catheter , is a catheter placed into a large vein . It is a form of venous access . Placement of larger catheters in more centrally located veins is often needed in critically ill patients, or in those requiring prolonged intravenous therapies, for more reliable vascular access. These catheters are commonly placed in veins in the neck , chest , groin , or through veins in the arms .	3.354905
Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy  is an immune-mediated inflammatory disorder of the peripheral nervous system . The disorder is sometimes called chronic relapsing polyneuropathy  or chronic inflammatory demyelinating poly radiculo neuropathy . CIDP is closely related to Guillain–Barré syndrome and it is thought to be the chronic counterpart of that acute disease.  Its symptoms are also similar to progressive inflammatory neuropathy . Several variants have been reported. Specially important are:	Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy is an acquired immune-mediated inflammatory disorder of the peripheral nervous system characterized by progressive weakness and impaired sensory function in the legs and arms.  The disorder is sometimes called chronic relapsing polyneuropathy  or chronic inflammatory demyelinating poly radiculo neuropathy .  CIDP is closely related to Guillain–Barré syndrome and it is considered the chronic counterpart of that acute disease.  Its symptoms are also similar to progressive inflammatory neuropathy . Several variants have been reported. Specially important are: Currently there is one special variant in which the CNS is also affected. It is termed "combined central and peripheral demyelination"  and is special because it belongs at the same time to the CDIP syndrome and to the multiple sclerosis spectrum.  These cases seem to be related to the presence of anti-neurofascin autoantibodies . 	3.3416116
Bevacizumab is an anti-angiogenic drug that is used in the treatment of Metastatic Renal cell carcinoma , Metastatic breast cancer , Non-small cell lung cancer , and is also approved in the treatment Glioblastoma multiforme . 	Bevacizumab , sold under the brand name Avastin , is a medication used to treat a number of types of cancers and a specific eye disease .   For cancer, it is given by slow injection into a vein  and used for colon cancer , lung cancer , glioblastoma , and renal-cell carcinoma . In many of these diseases it is used as a first-line therapy   For age-related macular degeneration it is given by injection into the eye .  Common side effects when used for cancer include nose bleeds , headache, high blood pressure, and rash.  Other severe side effects include gastrointestinal perforation , bleeding, allergic reactions , blood clots , and an increased risk of infection.  When used for eye disease side effects can include vision loss and retinal detachment .  Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody that functions as an angiogenesis inhibitor .  It works by slowing the growth of new blood vessels by inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor A , in other words anti–VEGF therapy . 	3.333475

Bacillus Calmette–Guerin is a vaccine against tuberculosis . It is often abbreviated BCG . The vaccine is based on a bovine strain of the bacterium . It was developed by Albert Calmette and Camille Guerin in the 1930s. It looks like the vaccine can also be used to treat certain forms of bladder cancer . 	Bacillus Calmette–Guérin  vaccine is a vaccine primarily used against tuberculosis .  It is named after its inventors Albert Calmette and Camille Guérin .   In countries where TB or leprosy is common, one dose is recommended in healthy babies as soon after birth as possible.  In areas where TB is not common, only children at high risk are typically immunized, while suspected cases of TB are individually tested for and treated.  Adults who do not have TB and have not been previously immunized but are frequently exposed may be immunized as well.  BCG also has some effectiveness against Buruli ulcer infection and other nontuberculous mycobacteria infections.  Additionally it is sometimes used as part of the treatment of bladder cancer .   Rates of protection against TB infection vary widely and protection lasts up to twenty years.  Among children it prevents about 20% from getting infected and among those who do get infected it protects half from developing disease.  The vaccine is given by injection into the skin.  There is no evidence that additional doses are beneficial. 	3.3255823
Retching  is when the motion of the stomach and esophagus goes backward, but there is no vomiting . It can be caused by bad smells, choking or stopping certain medications . It can also be because of stress . Retching is different from vomiting. During a retch, pressure in the thorax goes down and pressure in the abdomen goes up. In vomiting, both pressures go up.	Retching  is the reverse movement  of the stomach and esophagus without vomiting .  It can be caused by bad smells or choking, or by withdrawal from some medications after vomiting stops. Retching can also occur as a result of an emotional response or from stress , which produces the same physical reaction. The function is thought to be mixing gastric contents with intestinal refluxate in order to buffer the former and give it momentum in preparation of vomiting.  Treatments include medication and correction of the fluid and electrolyte balance . The retching phase is characterized by a series of violent spasmodic abdomino - thoracic contractions with the glottis closed. During this time, the inspiratory  movements of the chest wall and diaphragm are opposed by the expiratory contractions of the abdominal musculature. At the same time, movements of the stomach and its contents take place. Whereas a patient will complain of disagreeable sensations during nausea , speech is not possible during retching. The characteristic movements furnish a ready diagnostic sign of the retching phase. Schindler   studied retching on two occasions during gastroscopy and noted that longitudinal folds appeared in the previously smooth antrum , thickened quickly, came together and completely closed the antrum.  Retching involves a deep inspiration against a closed glottis . This, along with contraction of the abdomen, leads to a pressure difference between the abdominal and thoracic cavities. As a result, the stomach and gastric contents are displaced upwards toward the thoracic cavity.  Retching comprises a rhythmically alternating  elevation and descension of the entire pharyngolaryngo-esophago-gastric apparatus in synchrony with the movement of the diaphragm. The function of retching may be to mix gastric contents with intestinal refluxate to buffer gastric contents before gastroesophageal reflux and to impart a momentum to the gastric contents before vomiting. Airway protection during retching is accomplished by glottal closure during retches and constriction of the upper esophageal sphincter between retches. 	3.3254306
Bloodletting is the practice  of withdrawing blood from a patient to cure a disease . The practice was widely used in Antiquity and the Middle Ages . People stopped using it in the 19th century . The idea of bloodletting comes from an ancient system of medicine called Humorism : This system states, that there are different humors in the body. To remain healthy, a patient had to keep these humours in balance. Bloodletting was the most common medical practice performed by physicians from antiquity until the late 19th century, a span of almost 2,000 years.  It was found that only in very few cases, this treatment helps cure a disease. The practice has now been abandoned for all except a few very specific conditions .  There was no other treatment for hypertension . Bloodletting could sometimes have had a beneficial effect in temporarily reducing blood pressure by reducing blood volume.  The problem with hypertension is that it is difficult to diagonse from its symptoms . Modern methods directly measure blood pressure. In Antiquity, this  effect was therefore unintentional. In most cases, the historical use of bloodletting was harmful to patients.  The diseases where bloodletting actually helps include Polycythemia vera . In this disease, the number of red blood cells is increased, which changes the viscosity of the blood. Another disease is Polycythemia , which also leads to an increased number of red blood cells.	Bloodletting  is the withdrawal of blood from a patient to prevent or cure illness and disease.  Bloodletting, whether by a physician or by leeches , was based on an ancient system of medicine in which blood and other bodily fluids were regarded as " humours " that had to remain in proper balance to maintain health. It is claimed to have been the most common medical practice performed by surgeons from antiquity until the late 19th century, a span of over 2,000 years.  In Europe, the practice continued to be relatively common until the end of the 18th century.  The practice has now been abandoned by modern-style medicine for all except a few very specific medical conditions .  It is conceivable that historically, in the absence of other treatments for hypertension , bloodletting sometimes had a beneficial effect in temporarily reducing blood pressure by reducing blood volume.  However, since hypertension is very often asymptomatic and thus not diagnosable without modern methods, this effect was unintentional.  In the overwhelming majority of cases, the historical use of bloodletting was harmful to patients.  Today, the term phlebotomy refers to the drawing of blood for laboratory analysis or blood transfusion .  Therapeutic phlebotomy refers to the drawing of a unit of blood in specific cases like hemochromatosis , polycythemia vera , porphyria cutanea tarda , etc., to reduce the number of red blood cells.   The traditional medical practice of bloodletting is today considered to be a pseudoscience .  Passages from the Ebers  Papyrus may indicate that bloodletting by scarification  was an accepted practice in Ancient Egypt .    Egyptian burials have been reported to contain bloodletting instruments.  According to some accounts, the Egyptians based the idea on their observations of the hippopotamus ,  confusing its red secretions with blood and believing that it scratched itself to relieve distress.  	3.3085694
The British Medical Journal  is a popular peer-reviewed general medical journal. It is published by the BMJ Publishing Group in London . There is an online version.	The BMJ is a weekly peer-reviewed medical trade journal , published by the trade union the British Medical Association . The BMJ has editorial freedom from the BMA.  It is one of the world's oldest general medical journals. Originally called the British Medical Journal , the title was officially shortened to BMJ in 1988, and then changed to The BMJ in 2014.  The journal is published by BMJ Publishing Group Ltd , a subsidiary of the British Medical Association . The editor-in-chief of The BMJ is Fiona Godlee , who was appointed in February 2005.  The journal began publishing on 3 October 1840 as the Provincial Medical and Surgical Journal and quickly attracted the attention of physicians around the world through its publication of high-impact original research articles and unique case reports.  The BMJ' s first editors were P. Hennis Green , lecturer on the diseases of children at the Hunterian School of Medicine , who also was its founder and Robert Streeten of Worcester , a member of the Provincial Medical and Surgical Association council. 	3.3013365
An Elizabethan collar , also called a, e-collar , lampshade or cone of shame is a piece of equipment used in veterinary medicine .  They stop the animal from licking or biting its body and from scratching or touching its head with its feet.  The veterinarian places the collar around the neck of an injured animal so that it cannot bite or lick the injured part of its body.  For example, a dog with a cut on its skin might need medicine placed directly on the cut. The dog might try to lick the medicine and poison itself.  An animal that has had surgery might try to pull out its stitches .  An animal with a broken leg might bite into its cast and try to pull it off.  If it is wearing an Elizabethan collar, it cannot do this. Some pet owners say their pets find it difficult to eat, drink and play while wearing an Elizabethan collar.  Veterinarians sometimes try other collars, like those made out of cloth, collars that look like inner-tube-shaped cushions, and collars that act more like a neck brace , stopping the animal from moving its head.  Elizabethan collars are named after Elizabethan ruffs , stiff, starched collars that people wore in 1500s England. Today, most Elizabethan collars are made out of plastic .  In the 1800s, they could be made out of wood or leather. 	An Elizabethan collar , E-collar , Buster collar or pet cone  is a protective medical device worn by an animal, usually a cat or dog. Shaped like a truncated cone, its purpose is to prevent the animal from biting or licking at its body or scratching at its head or neck while wounds or injuries heal .  The collars are named from the ruffs worn in Elizabethan times .  A U.S. patent was filed by Frank L. Johnson in 1959.  The device is generally attached to the pet's usual collar with strings or tabs passed through holes punched in the sides of the plastic. The neck of the collar should be short enough to let the animal eat and drink. Although most pets adjust to them quite well, others will not eat or drink with the collar in place and the collar is temporarily removed for meals.  While purpose-made collars can be purchased from veterinarians or pet stores, they can also be made from plastic and cardboard or by using plastic flowerpots, wastebaskets, buckets or lampshades. Modern collars might involve soft fabric trim along the edges to increase comfort and velcro surfaces for ease of attachment and removal.	3.3008873

The COVID-19 pandemic in Papua New Guinea is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019  caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 . The virus was confirmed to have reached Papua New Guinea on 20 March 2020.  On 4 May 2020, Papua New Guinea was declared COVID-19 free. However, on 20 June, the government confirmed another case of COVID-19, meaning that the disease was present again within the country.   Until early 2021, the country managed to stave off a major COVID-19 outbreak, with only 1,275 cases reported at the end of February according to Johns Hopkins University. In March cases tripled, with Prime Minister James Marape speaking of "rampant community transmission".  By early May, the number of hospitalizations in the capital Port Moresby stabilized, but delays in receiving test results from regional areas were a concern.  In mid May, as the reasons for the apparent easing of the pandemic situation remained uncertain, discrepancies between government figures and higher ones from the provinces led to concerns that hundreds of COVID-19 cases had been missed in the national tally. 	3.2999287

A dependent personality disorder  is a personality disorder that involves a psychological dependence on other people. This personality disorder is a long-term  condition in which people depend on others to meet their emotional and physical needs. Only a small percentage of people with dependent personality disorders are eventually able to manage on their own.	Dependent personality disorder  is a personality disorder that is characterized by a pervasive psychological dependence on other people. This personality disorder is a long-term condition  in which people depend on others to meet their emotional and physical needs, with only a minority achieving normal levels of independence. Dependent personality disorder is a Cluster C personality disorder ,  characterized by excessive fear and anxiety. It begins by early adulthood, and it is present in a variety of contexts and is associated with inadequate functioning. Symptoms can include anything from extreme passivity, devastation or helplessness when relationships end, avoidance of responsibilities and severe submission. People who have dependent personality disorder are overdependent on other people when it comes to making decisions. They cannot make a decision on their own as they need constant approval from other people. Consequently, individuals diagnosed with DPD tend to place needs and opinions of others above their own as they do not have the confidence to trust their decisions. This kind of behaviour can explain why people with DPD tend to show passive and clingy behaviour. These individuals display a fear of separation and cannot stand being alone. When alone, they experience feelings of isolation and loneliness due to their overwhelming dependence on other people. Generally people with DPD are also pessimistic: they expect the worst out of situations or believe that the worst will happen. They tend to be more introverted and are more sensitive to criticism and fear rejection.  People with a history of neglect and an abusive upbringing are more susceptible to develop DPD, specifically those involved in long-term abusive relationships. Those with overprotective or authoritarian parents are also more at risk to develop DPD. Having a family history of anxiety disorder can play a role in the development of DPD as a 2004 twin study found a 0.81 heritability for personality disorders collectively. 	3.2985373
SARS coronavirus 2  is a positive-sense , single-stranded RNA coronavirus which causes the disease COVID-19 .  It used to be known as 2019 novel coronavirus  by the World Health Organization .   The virus started the 2019–20 coronavirus outbreak .    The first suspected cases were reported to the WHO on December 31, 2019.   Many early cases of this new coronavirus were linked to Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, a large seafood and animal market in Wuhan , China. The virus may have come from infected animals. It is not certain that this place was the source of the pandemic .  The genetic material of this virus showed many similarities to SARS-CoV   and bat coronaviruses .  This means the virus may have originally come from bats .    Scientists did more experiments that showed the virus probably went from bats to an intermediate host , meaning another animal in between bats and humans.  The viruses in that other animal changed over time until they could infect humans.  Scientists are close to sure that the original animal was a bat but not sure what the intermediate animal was.  Some scientists think it could have been a pangolin because there are coronaviruses that live in pangolins even though they are not exactly the same as SARS-CoV-2 or the ones in bats.  Pangolins are an endangered species and buying, selling or moving them from place to place is illegal in China and many other countries.  But their scales are an ingredient in many traditional Chinese medicines , so they are often sold on the black market .  Although SARS-CoV-2 began in bats, scientists noticed that the bats do not get sick and die from it.  They think this is because the bats have very careful immune systems that fight the virus without causing inflammation .  Scientists are studying bats because of this.  	Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2   is the virus that causes COVID-19 , the respiratory illness responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic .  Also colloquially known simply as the coronavirus , it was previously referred to by its provisional name , 2019 novel coronavirus ,     and has also been called human coronavirus 2019 .     The World Health Organization declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020, and a pandemic on 11 March 2020.   SARS‑CoV‑2 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus  that is contagious in humans.  As described by the US National Institutes of Health , it is the successor to SARS-CoV-1 , the virus that caused the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak .  SARS‑CoV‑2 is a virus of the species severe acute respiratory syndrome–related coronavirus .  It is believed to have zoonotic origins and has close genetic similarity to bat coronaviruses, suggesting it emerged from a bat-borne virus .   Research is ongoing as to whether SARS‑CoV‑2 came directly from bats or indirectly through any intermediate hosts.  The virus shows little genetic diversity , indicating that the spillover event introducing SARS‑CoV‑2 to humans is likely to have occurred in late 2019. 	3.2973392

The Germ theory of disease is a theory in biology . It says that small organisms , also known as microbes , cause some diseases . These diseases are called infectious diseases . The germ theory states that small organisms cause a reaction in the body of those who are infected. The body's reaction to infection is called a disease. Many scientists and doctors in history figured out that diseases are caused by microscopic organisms. Even after the microscope was invented, people still didn't know that germs caused diseases. People long believed that "bad air " from stinky trash dumps and from rotting meat was the cause of diseases. So people thought that covering their mouth and nose with a cloth would help filter out the "bad air." Scientists and doctors would use garlic and perfumes to ward off the bad air. But people still got sick and even died, so this theory was wrong. Polluted air is not the cause of disease. One problem with the old theories of disease was that people believed that living things were spontaneously generated. Spontaneous generation is when something like a fly grows from a small speck of smelly meat. That old theory is called abiogenesis . In the seventeenth century, Francesco Redi  discovered that flies lay eggs that become maggots . Prior to this, people thought that maggots came from rotting meat. He discovered this by sealing some meat in a jar and watching it. No maggots were found on the sealed meat. He also put some meat in a jar and covered it with gauze. Maggots were found on the gauze but not inside the jar. But when he placed meat in an open jar, maggots were found on the meat and inside the jar. Experiments like this proved that maggots come from flies who lay eggs, not from rotting meat. Later scientists would prove that diseases did not come from the air. Diseases are spread by infection. Also in the eighteenth century, Antonie van Leeuwenhoek discovered the first microscopic organisms with a microscope. He was the first microbiologist. He saw some of the microscopic organisms that cause diseases, but he didn't know what they were. In 1700, Nicolas Andry thought that some of these microscopic organisms caused smallpox and other diseases. Over 100 years later, Agostino Bassi figured out what caused disease in silkworms . Ignaz Semmelweis was a doctor who figured out that if doctors washed their hands after touching dead people, that other patients wouldn't get sick. That was in 1847. It was about this time that sanitation and hand washing became popular with some, but not all doctors. Doctors began to use chemicals to cleanse wounds and clean their tools between each patient.	The germ theory of disease is the currently accepted scientific theory for many diseases . It states that microorganisms known as pathogens or "germs" can lead to disease. These small organisms, too small to see without magnification, invade humans, other animals, and other living hosts. Their growth and reproduction within their hosts can cause disease. "Germ" may refer to not just a bacterium but to any type of microorganism, such as protists or fungi , or even non-living pathogens that can cause disease, such as viruses , prions , or viroids .  Diseases caused by pathogens are called infectious diseases . Even when a pathogen is the principal cause of a disease, environmental and hereditary factors often influence the severity of the disease, and whether a potential host individual becomes infected when exposed to the pathogen. Basic forms of germ theory were proposed in the late Middle Ages by physicians including Ibn Sina in 1025,  Ibn Khatima and Ibn al-Khatib in the 14th century,  Girolamo Fracastoro in 1546, and expanded upon by Marcus von Plenciz in 1762. However, such views were held in disdain in Europe, where Galen's miasma theory remained dominant among scientists and doctors.	3.2955353
Frequent urination is the urge to urinate more often than usual. Diuretics are substances that cause frequent urination. The most common cause of frequent urination is an infection of the urinary tract . Frequent urination does not need to be linked to a disease, though: things like being pregnant or being stressed can also cause it.	Frequent urination is the need to urinate more often than usual. Diuretics or medications that will increase urinary frequency. Nocturia is the need of frequent urination at night.  The most common cause of urinary frequency for women and children is a urinary tract infection . The most common cause of urinary frequency in older men is an enlarged prostate .  Frequent urination is strongly associated with frequent incidents of urinary urgency , which is the sudden need to urinate.  It is often, though not necessarily, associated with urinary incontinence and polyuria . However, in other cases, urinary frequency involves only normal volumes of urine overall.   The normal number of times varies according to the age of the person.  Among young children, urinating 8 to 14 times each day is typical.  This decreases to 6 to 12 times per day for older children, and to four to six times per day among teenagers. 	3.2861936
Drug withdrawal is the group of symptoms that occur upon the fast discontinuation or decrease in intake of medications or recreational drugs .  In order to experience the symptoms of withdrawal, one must have first developed a form of drug addiction , which may occur as physical dependence , psychological dependence , or both.  Anger : Because many marijuana users smoke as a means of escaping from difficult emotions, they don’t know how to regulate those emotions naturally.  The anger during withdrawal can range from a steady, mild stream of rage to a sudden and volatile outburst.  These can stem from feelings of anxiety and a general lack of emotional control during the first few days of withdrawing, which results in swaying back and forth between anger and euphoria.  However, these unbalanced emotions often regulate themselves naturally within three months. Insomnia : One of the most commonly reported symptoms associated with marijuana withdrawal is insomnia. This can range from a handful of consecutive sleepless nights to occasional sleepless nights over the course of several months. Nightmares : Nightmares and other forms of vivid dreams are also common in the later stages of withdrawal. They typically start about a week after last use and last anywhere from a week to a month. 	Drug withdrawal , drug withdrawal syndrome , or substance withdrawal syndrome ,  is the group of symptoms that occur upon the abrupt discontinuation or decrease in the intake of medicational or recreational drugs . In order for the symptoms of withdrawal to occur, one must have first developed a form of drug dependence . This may occur as physical dependence , psychological dependence or both. Drug dependence develops from consuming one or more substances over a period of time. Dependence arises in a dose-dependent manner and produces withdrawal symptoms that vary with the type of drug that is consumed. For example, prolonged use of an antidepressant medication is likely to cause a much different reaction when discontinued compared to discontinuation of an opioid , such as heroin . Withdrawal symptoms from opiates include anxiety, sweating, vomiting, and diarrhea. Alcohol withdrawal symptoms include irritability, fatigue, shaking, sweating, and nausea. Withdrawal from nicotine can cause irritability, fatigue, insomnia, headache, and difficulty concentrating. Many prescription and legal nonprescription substances can also cause withdrawal symptoms when individuals stop consuming them, even if they were taken as directed by a physician.	3.2767363
Amniocentesis is the name of a medical test that is often performed when screening babies . The test consist of taking a little Amniotic fluid , and testing this fluid . This fluid contains tissue of the embryo or fetus , and allows to determine the sex . It also allows to find certain birth defects .	Amniocentesis  is a medical procedure  used primarily in prenatal diagnosis of chromosomal abnormalities and fetal infections  as well as for sex determination . In this procedure, a small amount of amniotic fluid , which contains fetal tissues, is sampled from the amniotic sac surrounding a developing fetus . The fetal DNA is then examined for genetic abnormalities. The most common reason to have an amniocentesis performed is to determine whether a fetus has certain genetic disorders or a chromosomal abnormality, such as Down syndrome . Amniocentesis ) can diagnose these problems in the womb.  These prenatal examinations can prove helpful to expectant guardians, as they allow for evaluating the fetal health status and the feasibility of treatment.  An amniocentesis is performed when a woman is between 15 and 20 weeks gestation.  Women who choose to have this test are primarily those at increased risk for genetic and chromosomal problems, in part because the test is invasive and carries a small risk of miscarriage .  This process can be used for prenatal sex discernment and hence this procedure has legal restrictions in some countries.	3.270376

The Royal College of Physicians of London was the first medical group in England to receive a Royal Charter. It was created in 1518 and is one of the most active of all medical groups. It was originally created as the College of Physicians by royal charter of King Henry VIII in 1518.	The Royal College of Physicians  is a British professional membership body dedicated to improving the practice of medicine, chiefly through the accreditation of physicians by examination. Founded by royal charter from King Henry VIII in 1518, the RCP is the oldest medical college in England. It set the first international standard in the classification of diseases, and its library contains medical texts of great historical interest. The college is sometimes referred to as the Royal College of Physicians of London to differentiate it from other similarly named bodies. The RCP drives improvements in health and healthcare through advocacy, education and research. Its 40,000 members work in hospitals and communities across over 30 medical specialties with around a fifth based in over 80 countries worldwide.	3.2569559
Sinusitis means infection or inflammation of the sinuses , which are air-filled spaces inside the bones of the face. There are many symptoms, including thick nasal mucus , a plugged nose, and pain in the face. 	Sinusitis , also known as rhinosinusitis , is inflammation of the mucous membranes that line the sinuses resulting in symptoms that may include thick nasal mucus , a plugged nose , and facial pain .   Other signs and symptoms may include fever , headaches , a poor sense of smell , sore throat , and a cough .  It is defined as acute sinusitis if it lasts less than 4 weeks, and as chronic sinusitis if it lasts for more than 12 weeks.  Sinusitis can be caused by infection , allergies , air pollution , or structural problems in the nose.  Most cases are caused by a viral infection .  Recurrent episodes are more likely in persons with asthma , cystic fibrosis , and poor immune function .  X-rays are not usually needed unless complications are suspected.  In chronic cases, confirmatory testing is recommended by either direct visualization or computed tomography .  Some cases may be prevented by hand washing, avoiding smoking, and immunization .  Pain killers such as naproxen , nasal steroids , and nasal irrigation may be used to help with symptoms.   Recommended initial treatment for acute sinusitis is watchful waiting .  If symptoms do not improve in 7–10 days or get worse, then an antibiotic may be used or changed.  In those in whom antibiotics are used, either amoxicillin or amoxicillin/clavulanate is recommended first line.  Surgery may occasionally be used in people with chronic disease. 	3.2566073
Azathioprine is an immunosuppressant drug . It is used in, for example, the organ transplantation of kidneys .	Azathioprine , sold under the brand name Imuran , among others, is an immunosuppressive medication .  It is used in rheumatoid arthritis , granulomatosis with polyangiitis , Crohn's disease , ulcerative colitis , and systemic lupus erythematosus , and in kidney transplants to prevent rejection .     It is taken by mouth or injected into a vein .  Common side effects include bone-marrow suppression and vomiting .  Bone-marrow suppression is especially common in people with a genetic deficiency of the enzyme thiopurine S-methyltransferase .  Other serious risk factors include an increased risk of certain cancers .  Use during pregnancy may result in harm to the baby.  Azathioprine is in the purine analogue and antimetabolite family of medications.   It works via 6-thioguanine to disrupt the making of RNA and DNA by cells.   Azathioprine was first made in 1957.  It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines .  In 2017, it was the 335th-most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 800,000 prescriptions. 	3.2545197
The Medical Renaissance from 1400 to 1700 AD is a period of progress in European medical knowledge. There was a new interest in the ideas of the ancient Greeks and Romans . The medical discoveries during the Medical Renaissance paved the way for modern medicine.   Progress made during the Medical Renaissance depended on several things.   By studying anatomy they learnt the positions of bones , muscles , and organs . Andreas Vesalius published De humani corporis fabrica  in 1543.  That was the first time in history that realistic diagrams of dissections were published. Much later  the Englishman William Harvey discovered that blood is pumped by the heart, travels through the body in blood vessels, and returns back to the heart in the circulatory system.  Thus basic facts of anatomy and physiology began to be understood by physicians . However, Harvey's work belongs to a later period. At the beginning of the period, in 1400, doctors were ignorant of physiology and had some  pretty strange ideas. In the renaissance, a very important theory in medicine was the Four humours or Four temperaments. This theory had begun with the Ancient Greeks , and influenced medical development until the 19th century. According to the theory, the body was filled with four different substances, called humours . When a person is healthy, these substances are in balance. When there is an imbalance between the humours, the person will be sick. The sickness can be cured by bringing the four humours back to balance. The four substances are: black bile , yellow bile, phlegm and blood . The Roman medic Galen still supported that theory, but refined it in many ways.	The Medical Renaissance , from around 1400 to 1700 CE , was a period of progress in European medical knowledge, with renewed interest in the ideas of the ancient Greek and Roman civilizations along with Arabic-Persian medicine , following the translation into Latin of many works from these societies. Medical discoveries during the Medical Renaissance are credited with paving the way for modern medicine. The Medical Renaissance began just as the original Renaissance did, in the early 16th century. Medical researchers continued their Renaissance-evoked practices into the late 17th century.   Progress made during the Medical Renaissance depended on several factors.   Printed books based on movable type , adopted in Europe from the middle of the 15th century, allowed the diffusion of medical ideas and anatomical diagrams. Linacre , Erasmus , Leonicello and Sylvius are among the list of the first scholars most credited for the starting of the Medical Renaissance.  Following after is Andreas Vesalius 's publication of De humani corporis fabrica  in 1543.  Better knowledge of the original writings of Galen in particular, developed into the learned medicine tradition through the more open attitudes of Renaissance humanism . Church control of the teachings of the medical profession and universities diminished, and dissection was more often possible.	3.250285
Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing  is considered by many therapists as a major form of psychotherapy . Francine Shapiro, Ph.D., noted that recalling or thinking about disturbing events, coupled with eye-motion; audio input or sensory input  could aid unprocessed emotional trauma that are emotionally hurtful or painful to the body. The once painful emotional materials are un-embedded via recall of the event coupled with a sensory input which are 'metabolized' by the person's psyche from a painful and harmful state into a helpful learning experience. This processing has proven useful in helping overcome many traumatic events ranging from rape, family violence, physical or verbal abuse, first-responder shock, chronic pain, combat, hurtful memories; select health issues and unresolved, hurtful life experiences. EMDR involves the processing of painful emotional events via the recalling of the event...paired with movement of the eyes; the hearing of select sound; tactile contact; gustatory  input as an input into the brains processing. This process helps the client to move-on from the physical or emotional pain they are feeling. EMDR or Adaptive Information Processing  as it is alternatively named, has been being tested and researched in a large number of organizations since it was first discovered in 1987. Like all psychological theorems and processes it has it's admiring adherents and strong critics. The EMDR has training and trainers licensed internationally and over 10,000 psychologists and therapists qualified to practice in the U.S. TREATMENT DESCRIPTION	Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing  is a form of psychotherapy developed by Francine Shapiro starting in 1988 in which the person being treated is asked to recall distressing images; the therapist then directs the patient in one type of bilateral stimulation, such as side-to-side eye rapid movement  or hand tapping.  According to the 2013 World Health Organization practice guideline: "This therapy  is based on the idea that negative thoughts, feelings and behaviours are the result of unprocessed memories. The treatment involves standardized procedures that include focusing simultaneously on  spontaneous associations of traumatic images, thoughts, emotions and bodily sensations and  bilateral stimulation that is most commonly in the form of repeated eye movements."  EMDR is included in several evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder , with varying levels of recommendation and evidence .    As of 2020, the American Psychological Association lists EMDR as an evidence-based treatment for PTSD  but stresses that "the available evidence can be interpreted in several ways" and notes there is debate about the precise mechanism by which EMDR appears to relieve PTSD symptoms with some evidence EMDR may simply be a variety of exposure therapy .  EMDR therapy was first developed by Francine Shapiro upon noticing that certain eye movements reduced the intensity of a disturbing thought. She then conducted a scientific study with trauma victims in 1988 and the research was published in the Journal of Traumatic Stress in 1989.  Her hypothesis was that when a traumatic or distressing experience occurs, it may overwhelm normal coping mechanisms , with the memory and associated stimuli being inadequately processed and stored in an isolated memory network. 	3.245937

Remdesivir is a broad-spectrum antiviral medication created by the biopharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences .  It was designed to treat Ebola . As of 2020, remdesivir is being tested as a specific treatment for COVID-19 . It is being used for the sickest of patients during the pandemic .  It may shorten the time it takes to recover from the infection.  Treatment is given by injection into a vein .   On May 1, the United States Food and Drug Administration gave doctors permission to use remdesivir on patients with COVID-19.  Ordinarily, the FDA would test remdesivir first to see if it worked on patients with COVID-19, but because of the COVID-19 pandemic, they told doctors they could start using the drug before the tests were finished. In October 2020, the National Institutes of Health told the world the results of its tests: They studied 11,000 people and found that remdesivir did not help keep COVID-19 patients alive.  Gilead and some scientists said the results of the tests might not be correct. 	Remdesivir , sold under the brand name Veklury ,   is a broad-spectrum antiviral medication developed by the biopharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences .  It is administered via injection into a vein .   During the COVID-19 pandemic , remdesivir was approved or authorized for emergency use to treat COVID‑19 in around 50 countries.

Remdesivir is a broad-spectrum antiviral medication created by the biopharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences .  It was designed to treat Ebola . As of 2020, remdesivir is being tested as a specific treatment for COVID-19 . It is being used for the sickest of patients during the pandemic .  It may shorten the time it takes to recover from the infection.  Treatment is given by injection into a vein .   On May 1, the United States Food and Drug Administration gave doctors permission to use remdesivir on patients with COVID-19.  Ordinarily, the FDA would test remdesivir first to see if it worked on patients with COVID-19, but because of the COVID-19 pandemic, they told doctors they could start using the drug before the tests were finished. In October 2020, the National Institutes of Health told the world the results of its tests: They studied 11,000 people and found that remdesivir did not help keep COVID-19 patients alive.  Gilead and some scientists said the results of the tests might not be correct.

A tension headache is a common form of headache . Tension headaches affect the head , eyes and nearby areas of the body. They are very common with adults. Females are twice as likely as males to have them.  Tension headaches may be caused by:	Tension headache , also known as stress headache , or tension-type headache , is the most common type of primary headache . The pain can radiate from the lower back of the head, the neck, eyes or other muscle groups in the body typically affecting both sides of the head. Tension-type headaches account for nearly 90% of all headaches. Pain medication, such as aspirin and ibuprofen , are effective for the treatment of tension headache.   Tricyclic antidepressants appear to be useful for prevention.  Evidence is poor for SSRIs , propranolol and muscle relaxants .   As of 2016, tension headaches affect about 1.89 billion people  and are more common in women than men . 	3.2334146
Cannabis drug testing describes many drug testing methods for the use of cannabis in medicine, sport, and law.  Cannabis use is easy to detect using urine testing, hair analysis and breath. There are some ways to cheat such a test using synthetic urine or human hair - making blood testing the most effective.  Unlike alcohol, Cannabis testing is time consuming, expensive and cannot give accurate time of consuming and level of intoxication.  The lack of good testing methods and universal intoxication level scale is an issue in the legality of cannabis debate, especially regarding intoxicated driving . 	Cannabis drug testing describes various drug test methodologies for the use of cannabis in medicine, sport, and law. Cannabis use is highly detectable and can be detected by urinalysis , hair analysis , as well as saliva tests for days or weeks. Unlike alcohol, for which impairment can be reasonably measured using a breathalyser , valid detection for cannabis is time-consuming, and tests cannot determine an approximate degree of impairment. The lack of suitable tests and agreed-upon intoxication levels is an issue in the legality of cannabis , especially regarding intoxicated driving . The concentrations obtained from such analyses can often be helpful in distinguishing active use from passive exposure, elapsed time since use, and extent or duration of use. Although between 2000-2020 there had been a recall for 80% of at home drug testing kits. Because of this many companies took action and the industries identified the contents of these products which led them to take efforts of identifying the problem by finding a solution involving the chemical immunoassay. This was the main cause of why drug tests were so unreliable for the time being.	3.230586
A cerebral arteriovenous malformation  is a rare connection between the arteries and veins in the brain . It is an arteriovenous malformation in the cerebrum . In serious cases, the blood vessels rupture and there is bleeding within the brain . Nevertheless, in more than half of patients with AVM, hemorrhage is the first symptom.  The most problems related to an AVM, are headaches and seizures , cranial nerve deficits,  backaches, neckaches and eventual nausea.	A cerebral arteriovenous malformation  is an abnormal connection between the arteries and veins in the brain —specifically, an arteriovenous malformation in the cerebrum . The most frequently observed problems, related to an AVM, are headaches and seizures , cranial nerve deficits,  backaches, neckaches and eventual nausea, as the coagulated blood makes its way down to be dissolved in the individual's spinal fluid. It is supposed that 15% of the population, at detection, have no symptoms at all.  Other common symptoms are a pulsing noise in the head, progressive weakness and numbness and vision changes as well as debilitating, excruciating pain.   In serious cases, the blood vessels rupture and there is bleeding within the brain . Nevertheless, in more than half of patients with AVM, hemorrhage is the first symptom.  Symptoms due to bleeding include loss of consciousness, sudden and severe headache, nausea, vomiting, incontinence , and blurred vision, amongst others.  Impairments caused by local brain tissue damage on the bleed site are also possible, including seizure, one-sided weakness , a loss of touch sensation on one side of the body and deficits in language processing .  Ruptured AVMs are responsible for considerable mortality and morbidity. 	3.225355
An airborne transmission is transmission of diseases through small particulates that can be passed through the air over time and distance.  Diseases that can be infected through airborne transmission may be viruses , bacteria , or fungi , and they may be spread through breathing, talking, coughing, sneezing, raising of dust, spraying of liquids or even flushing toilets .	An airborne transmission is disease transmission through small particulates that can be transmitted through the air over time and distance.  Diseases capable of airborne transmission include many of considerable importance both in human and veterinary medicine . The relevant pathogens may be viruses , bacteria , or fungi , and they may be spread through breathing, talking, coughing, sneezing, raising of dust, spraying of liquids, flushing toilets , or any activities which generate aerosol particles or droplets . Human airborne diseases do not include conditions caused by air pollution such as volatile organic compounds , gases and any airborne particles. Airborne transmission traditionally has been considered distinct from transmission by droplets , based on misunderstandings of the physical behaviour of particles of various sizes.  Respiratory droplets were thought to be large enough to fall to the ground rapidly after being produced;  however, if particles of any size can be inhaled, they are essentially airborne particles. 	3.2178128
Cerebral amyloid angiopathy , also known as congophilic angiopathy ,  is a form of angiopathy in which amyloid comes out of the walls of the blood vessels of the central nervous system.  The term congophilic is used because the amyloid appears red when looked under a microscope when Congo red dye is used. The amyloid material is only found in the brain and as such the disease is not related to other forms of amyloidosis . 	Cerebral amyloid angiopathy , is a form of angiopathy in which amyloid beta peptide deposits in the walls of small to medium blood vessels of the central nervous system and meninges .   The term congophilic is sometimes used because the presence of the abnormal aggregations of amyloid can be demonstrated by microscopic examination of brain tissue after staining with Congo red . The amyloid material is only found in the brain and as such the disease is not related to other forms of amyloidosis .  CAA is associated with brain hemorrhages, particularly microhemorrhages. Since CAA can be caused by the same amyloid protein that is associated with Alzheimer's dementia, brain bleeds  are more common in people who have a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. However, they can also occur in those who have no history of dementia .  The bleeding within the brain is usually confined to a particular lobe  and this is slightly different compared to brain bleeds which occur as a consequence of high blood pressure  - a more common cause of a hemorrhagic stroke .  CAA has been identified as occurring either sporadically   or in familial forms such as Flemish, Iowa, and Dutch types. In all cases, it is defined by the deposition of amyloid beta  in the leptomeningal and cerebral vessel walls.  CAA occurring in the Flemish type has been observed to be linked to large dense-core plaques observed in this pedigree. 	3.2140234
The Lancet is a weekly peer reviewed general medical journal .  The journal was founded in 1823 by Thomas Wakley , an English surgeon . The word "lancet" has two meanings: a surgical knife, and an architectural term " lancet arch ",  a window with a sharp pointed arch. This might suggest  the "light of wisdom" or "to let in light". The journal publishes original research articles, review articles , editorials, book reviews, correspondence, as well as news features and case reports. The Lancet has been owned by Elsevier since 1991.  The journal has editorial offices in London , New York , and Beijing .	The Lancet is a weekly peer-reviewed general medical journal .

Light therapy is a treatment where the patient is exposed to light . Depression , sleeping problems , and many skin disorders are treated with this therapy. The therapy consists of exposing the patient to a light source. The light source usually emits the full spectrum of light. Sometimes, this has to be done at a specific time of day.	Light therapy —or phototherapy , classically referred to as heliotherapy —consists either of exposure to daylight or some equivalent form of light as a treatment for seasonal affective disorder , or exposure of the skin to specific wavelengths of light using polychromatic polarised light to treat a skin condition. It is used as a treatment for wintertime seasonal affective disorder and in circadian rhythm disorders , such as delayed sleep phase disorder .  There is tentative evidence to support its use to treat non-seasonal psychiatric disorders , in particular major depression and depression in bipolar disorder .    As a treatment for disorders of the skin, the second kind of light therapy, called ultraviolet light therapy , is meant to correct psoriasis , acne vulgaris , eczema and neonatal jaundice .  	3.2070117
Angiography or arteriography is the name for several imaging techniques to show the inside of blood vessels . These techniques include:	Angiography or arteriography is a medical imaging technique used to visualize the inside, or lumen , of blood vessels and organs of the body, with particular interest in the arteries , veins , and the heart chambers . This is traditionally done by injecting a radio-opaque contrast agent into the blood vessel and imaging using X-ray based techniques such as fluoroscopy . The word itself comes from the Greek words ἀγγεῖον angeion 'vessel' and γράφειν graphein 'to write, record'. The film or image of the blood vessels is called an angiograph , or more commonly an angiogram . Though the word can describe both an arteriogram and a venogram , in everyday usage the terms angiogram and arteriogram are often used synonymously, whereas the term venogram is used more precisely.  The term angiography has been applied to radionuclide angiography and newer vascular imaging techniques such as CO 2 angiography , CT angiography and MR angiography .  The term isotope angiography has also been used, although this more correctly is referred to as isotope perfusion scanning .	3.2059639

Dental braces are wires that are held together by brackets glued to the permanent teeth . The wires and brackets may be made of metal or other materials. Each week or month  the braces may be checked, cleaned, or changed into a tighter wire. Braces are an orthodontic device. They are to make the teeth straight, and to correct problems in a person's bite. There are many natural problems which occur to the way teeth fit together, but not everyone needs or will need braces. However, the use of braces is quite common, even when they are not medically necessary. Their cosmetic use for young females is more common in countries with first world economies . To overcome the visibility of traditional metal braces, there are now nearly transparent braces. Sometimes braces are possible behind the teeth, and so are not in view. 	Dental braces  are devices used in orthodontics that align and straighten teeth and help  position them with regard to a person's bite, while also aiming to improve dental health. Braces also fix gaps. They are often used to correct underbites , as well as malocclusions , overbites , open bites, deep bites , cross bites , crooked teeth, and various other flaws of the teeth and jaw . Braces can be either cosmetic or structural. Dental braces are often used in conjunction with other orthodontic appliances to help widen the palate or jaws and to otherwise assist in shaping the teeth and jaws. The application of braces moves the teeth as a result of force and pressure on the teeth. There are traditionally four basic elements used: brackets, bonding material, arch wire, and ligature elastic . The teeth move when the arch wire puts pressure on the brackets and teeth. Sometimes springs or rubber bands are used to put more force in a specific direction.   Braces have constant pressure which, over time, move teeth into the desired positions. The process loosens the tooth after which new bone grows in to support the tooth in its new position. This is called bone remodeling . Bone remodeling is a biomechanical process responsible for making bones stronger in response to sustained load-bearing activity and weaker in the absence of carrying a load. Bones are made of cells called osteoclasts and osteoblasts. Two different kinds of bone resorption are possible: direct resorption, which starts from the lining cells of the alveolar bone, and indirect or retrograde resorption, which occurs when the periodontal ligament has been subjected to an excessive amount and duration of compressive stress.  Another important factor associated with tooth movement is bone deposition. Bone deposition occurs in the distracted periodontal ligament. Without bone deposition, the tooth will loosen, and voids will occur distal to the direction of tooth movement. 	3.202762
Nausea is a general feeling of unease and discomfort in the stomach , often with the urge to vomit . The word nausea comes from the Latin word for seasickness .  Nausea is a symptom , rather than an illness or disease . The causes for it very often are not in the stomach itself, but somewhere else in the body. Nausea is often caused by a stomach virus. Nausea is usually harmless, in the short term. A good treatment for it can be not to take solid food . Nausea can also occur during pregnancy , and is quite normal in that context. People can suffer nausea without vomiting.	Nausea is a diffuse sensation of unease and discomfort, often perceived as an urge to vomit .  While not painful, it can be a debilitating symptom if prolonged and has been described as placing discomfort on the chest, upper abdomen, or back of the throat.  Over 30 definitions of nausea were proposed in a 2011 book on the topic.  Nausea is a non-specific symptom , which means that it has many possible causes. Some common causes of nausea are gastroenteritis and other gastrointestinal disorders , food poisoning , motion sickness , dizziness , migraine , fainting , low blood sugar and lack of sleep . Nausea is a side effect of many medications including chemotherapy , or morning sickness in early pregnancy. Nausea may also be caused by disgust and depression . 	3.1990447

The emergency department  is a part of a hospital for treating people who have just come to the hospital, need to be treated quickly even without an appointment. These people may have been hurt, or they may have suddenly become very ill. Patients come to an emergency department with little warning. Many come in an ambulance . Emergency departments often have staff working all day and all night, on every day of the week. This is because patients can arrive at any time. To work in those places, doctors and nurses must be trained in emergency medicine . There are many different names for an emergency department. They are often called an emergency room , even if they are bigger than one room. They may also be called an emergency ward  or emergency unit . In the United Kingdom and Ireland, they are usually called accident & emergency department  and less often as a casualty department . A 2005 patient study found an average emergency room wait time from 2 hours in Iowa to more than 5 hours in Arizona .  The Midwest had the highest number of emergency room visits . The West had the lowest number. 	An emergency department , also known as an accident & emergency department , emergency room , emergency ward  or casualty department , is a medical treatment facility specializing in emergency medicine , the acute care of patients who present without prior appointment; either by their own means or by that of an ambulance . The emergency department is usually found in a hospital or other primary care center. Due to the unplanned nature of patient attendance, the department must provide initial treatment for a broad spectrum of illnesses and injuries, some of which may be life-threatening and require immediate attention. In some countries, emergency departments have become important entry points for those without other means of access to medical care.	3.195824
Aripiprazole  is an antipsychotic medicine used for treatment of schizophrenia , bipolar disorder , autism and an adjuvant for major depression , which was first approved by Food and Drug Administration of the United States in November 2002. The first approval was for the treatment of schizophrenia . Later approvals were for bipolar disorder and depression. Common side effects include increase of blood sugar , vomiting , nausea and dizziness.	Aripiprazole , sold under the brand name Abilify among others, is an atypical antipsychotic .  It is primarily used in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder .  Other uses include as an add-on treatment in major depressive disorder , tic disorders and irritability associated with autism .  It is taken by mouth or injection into a muscle .  A Cochrane review found evidence of effectiveness in treating schizophrenia.  In adults, side effects with greater than 10% incidence include weight gain, headache, akathisia , insomnia, and gastro-intestinal effects like nausea and constipation, and lightheadedness.      Side effects in children are similar, and include sleepiness, increased appetite, and stuffy nose.  A strong desire to gamble, binge eat, shop, and engage in sexual activity may also occur.   Common side effects include vomiting, constipation, sleepiness, dizziness, weight gain and movement disorders .  Serious side effects may include neuroleptic malignant syndrome , tardive dyskinesia and anaphylaxis .  It is not recommended for older people with dementia -related psychosis due to an increased risk of death.  In pregnancy , there is evidence of possible harm to the baby.   It is not recommended in women who are breastfeeding .  It has not been very well studied in people less than 18 years old.  The exact mode of action is not entirely clear but may involve effects on dopamine and serotonin . 	3.1937447

Acute radiation syndrome  also known as radiation poisoning , radiation sickness or radiation toxicity , is a syndrome or group of health effects which occur within months of exposure to high amounts of ionizing radiation .   The term generally refers to acute  problems rather than ones that develop after a prolonged period.    It is mainly damage to the blood , digestive system , and nervous system .	Acute radiation syndrome , also known as radiation sickness or radiation poisoning , is a collection of health effects that are caused by being exposed to high amounts of ionizing radiation , in a short period of time.  The symptoms of ARS can start within the hour of exposure, and can last for several months.    Within the first few days the symptoms are usually nausea, vomiting and a loss of appetite.  In the following few hours or weeks will be a few symptoms, which later become additional symptoms, after which either recovery or death follow.  ARS involves a total dose of greater than 0.7 Gy , that generally occurs from a source outside the body, delivered within a few minutes.  Sources of such radiation can occur accidentally or intentionally.  They may involve nuclear reactors , cyclotrons , and certain devices used in cancer therapy .  It is generally divided into three types: bone marrow, gastrointestinal, and neurovascular syndrome, with bone marrow syndrome occurring at 0.7 to 10 Gy, and neurovascular syndrome occurring at doses that exceed 50 Gy.   The cells that are most affected are generally those that are rapidly dividing.  At high doses, this causes DNA damage that may be irreparable.  Diagnosis is based on a history of exposure and symptoms.  Repeated complete blood counts  can indicate the severity of exposure.  Treatment of ARS is generally supportive care .  This may include blood transfusions , antibiotics , colony-stimulating factors , or stem cell transplant .  Radioactive material remaining on the skin or in the stomach should be removed.  If radioiodine was inhaled or ingested, potassium iodide is recommended.  Complications like leukemia and other cancers among those who survive are managed as usual.  Short term outcomes depend on the dose exposure. 	3.185672
A blood test , also known as bloodwork , is a laboratory analysis performed on a blood sample. The sample  is usually taken from a vein in the arm using a needle , or via fingerprick .  Blood tests  are used to determine physiological and biochemical states, such as disease , mineral content, drug effectiveness, and organ function. They are also used to test for certain drugs .	A blood test is a laboratory analysis performed on a blood sample that is usually extracted from a vein in the arm using a hypodermic needle , or via fingerprick . Multiple tests for specific blood components, such as a glucose test or a cholesterol test , are often grouped together into one test panel called a blood panel or blood work . Blood tests are often used in health care to determine physiological and biochemical states, such as disease , mineral content, pharmaceutical drug effectiveness, and organ function. Typical clinical blood panels include a basic metabolic panel or a complete blood count . Blood tests are also used in drug tests to detect drug abuse. A venipuncture is useful as it is a minimally invasive way to obtain cells and extracellular fluid  from the body for analysis. Blood flows throughout the body, acting as a medium that provides oxygen and nutrients to tissues and carries waste products back to the excretory systems for disposal. Consequently, the state of the bloodstream affects or is affected by, many medical conditions. For these reasons, blood tests are the most commonly performed medical tests .  If only a few drops of blood are needed, a fingerstick is performed instead of a venipuncture . 	3.1845138
Acrohobia is the fear of heights . People with acrophobia experience a fear or phobia when they are at a certain height, and they are being made aware of it. The word is derived from Ancient Greek akros - top, height, and phobia - fear.  People who do not suffer from acrophobia are said to have a head for heights . Vertigo is often used to describe a fear of heights.	Acrophobia is an extreme or irrational fear or phobia of heights, especially when one is not particularly high up. It belongs to a category of specific phobias , called space and motion discomfort, that share both similar causes and options for treatment. Most people experience a degree of natural fear when exposed to heights, known as the fear of falling . On the other hand, those who have little fear of such exposure are said to have a head for heights . A head for heights is advantageous for those hiking or climbing in mountainous terrain and also in certain jobs such as steeplejacks or wind turbine mechanics. People with acrophobia can experience a panic attack in high places and become too agitated to get themselves down safely. Approximately 2–5% of the general population has acrophobia, with twice as many women affected as men.  The term is from the Greek : ἄκρον , ákron , meaning "peak, summit, edge" and φόβος , phóbos , "fear".	3.1790457
Prognosis refers to the expected course/outcome of a disease .	Prognosis  is a medical term for predicting the likely or expected development of a disease, including whether the signs and symptoms will improve or worsen  or remain stable over time; expectations of quality of life, such as the ability to carry out daily activities; the potential for complications and associated health issues; and the likelihood of survival .   A prognosis is made on the basis of the normal course of the diagnosed disease, the individual's physical and mental condition, the available treatments, and additional factors.  A complete prognosis includes the expected duration, function, and description of the course of the disease, such as progressive decline, intermittent crisis, or sudden, unpredictable crisis. When applied to large statistical populations , prognostic estimates can be very accurate: for example the statement "45% of patients with severe septic shock will die within 28 days" can be made with some confidence, because previous research found that this proportion of patients died. This statistical information does not apply to the prognosis for each individual patient, because patient-specific factors can substantially change the expected course of the disease: additional information is needed to determine whether a patient belongs to the 45% who will die, or to the 55% who survive.  Prognostic scoring is also used for cancer outcome predictions. A Manchester score is an indicator of prognosis for small-cell lung cancer . For Non-Hodgkin lymphoma , physicians have developed the International Prognostic Index to predict patient outcome.	3.1610377
In medicine , distress is a situation when a person is unable to completely adapt to stress . As a result, the person shows a set of behaviours which are not adapted to the situation. Very often, the person is aware of the situation, and feels bad about not being able to fully adapt. People often find ways of dealing with distress, in both negative and positive ways. Examples of positive ways are listening to music, calming exercises, sports and similar healthy distractions. Negative ways can include but are not limited to use of drugs including alcohol, and expression of anger, which are likely to lead to complicated social interactions, thus causing increased distress.	In medicine, distress is an aversive state in which a person is unable to completely adapt to stressors and their resulting stress and shows maladaptive behaviors.  It can be evident in the presence of various phenomena, such as inappropriate social interaction . Distress is the opposite of eustress , a positive stress that motivates people. Stress can be created by influences such as work , school, peers or co-workers, family and death. Other influences vary by age.	3.1595583
Interstitial cystitis , also called bladder pain syndrome , is a disease that causes pain in the bladder . 	Interstitial cystitis , also known as bladder pain syndrome , is a type of chronic pain that affects the bladder and pelvic floor.  Together with CP/CPPS , it makes up urologic chronic pelvic pain syndrome  .  Symptoms include feeling the need to urinate right away , needing to urinate often , and pain with sex .  IC/BPS is associated with depression and lower quality of life .  Many of those affected also have irritable bowel syndrome and fibromyalgia .  The cause of IC/BPS is unknown.  While it can, it does not typically run in a family.  The diagnosis is usually based on the symptoms after ruling out other conditions .  Typically the urine culture is negative.  Ulceration or inflammation may be seen on cystoscopy .  Other conditions which can produce similar symptoms include urinary tract infection , overactive bladder , sexually transmitted infections , endometriosis , bladder cancer , and prostatitis .  	3.159324
Derealization  is a change in the way someone views the world so that it seems unreal. Derealization can also make someone feel as if their environment does not have emotion or depth. This is a symptom of other problems, such as sleeping disorders , schizophrenia , and other mental disorders . It can also be caused by drug intoxication . Similar to derealization is depersonalization , but the two are different. Depersonalization is a sense of unreality about oneself. Derealization is a sense of unreality of the outside world. Derealization often happens during a traumatic or tragic event.	Derealization is an alteration in the perception of the external world, causing sufferers to perceive it as unreal, distant, distorted or falsified. Other symptoms include feeling as though one's environment is lacking in spontaneity, emotional coloring, and depth.  It is a dissociative symptom that may appear in moments of severe stress.  Derealization is a subjective experience pertaining to a person's perception of the outside world, while depersonalization is a related symptom characterized by dissociation towards one's own body and mental processes. The two are commonly experienced in conjunction with one another, but are also known to occur independently.  Chronic derealization is fairly rare, and may be caused by occipital – temporal dysfunction.  Experiencing derealization for long periods of time or having recurring episodes can be indicative of many psychological disorders, and can cause significant distress among sufferers. However, temporary derealization symptoms are commonly experienced by the general population a few times throughout their lives, with a lifetime prevalence of up to 26-74% and a prevalence of 31–66% at the time of a traumatic event . 	3.1569667
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy  is a type of psychotherapy which aims to help people transform their maladaptive thoughts and behaviours into a better state of being. Psychologists task patients to try out different situational coping skills and help patients to acknowledge, then challenge those problematic thought patterns , feelings and behaviors.  CBT refers to many types of psychotherapeutic systems that deal with cognitions , interpretations, beliefs and responses. These systems come from strategies commonly used in cognitive therapy and behavior therapy , combining them.  This combination is used to identify problems faced in the present and tries to improve the patient's current state of mind.  CBT has emerged as a common treatment for concerns regarding moods. It has become increasingly popular for reasons such as its defined structure and that it is based on common sense.  Research shows that CBT is the most effective form of treatment for those coping with depression and anxiety. CBT alone is 50-75% effective for overcoming depression and anxiety after 5 – 15 modules. Medication alone is effective, however, science still does not understand the long-term effects on the brain and body. There is evidence which suggests that CBT may be more cost-efficient in the long run in comparison to medication. Although, a combination of medication and CBT seems to be the most effective in overcoming mental illness. In particular, antidepressants paired with CBT could reduce potential relapses in patients facing depression.  CBT is often recommended for mood-related disorders such as depression and anxiety , but it can also treat personality disorders , post traumatic stress disorder and eating disorders . CBT can take place one-on-one between a therapist and a client, during group therapy, or online . In the early 1900s, Austrian psychotherapist Alfred Adler’s notion of basic mistakes and their role in unpleasant emotions made him one of the earliest therapists to address cognition in psychotherapy. His work inspired American psychologist Albert Ellis to develop rational emotive behaviour therapy  in the 1950s. This is now considered one of the earliest forms of cognitive psychotherapy. It is based on the idea that a person’s emotional distress arises from their thoughts about an event rather than the actual event itself.	Cognitive behavioral therapy  is a psycho-social intervention   that aims to improve mental health .  CBT focuses on challenging and changing cognitive distortions  and behaviors, improving emotional regulation ,   and the development of personal coping strategies that target solving current problems. It was originally designed to treat depression , but its uses have been expanded to include treatment of a number of mental health conditions, including anxiety ,   alcohol and drug use problems, marital problems, and eating disorders.   CBT includes a number of cognitive or behavior psychotherapies that treat defined psychopathologies using evidence-based techniques and strategies.    CBT is based on the combination of the basic principles from behavioral and cognitive psychology .  It is different from historical approaches to psychotherapy , such as the psychoanalytic approach where the therapist looks for the unconscious meaning behind the behaviors and then formulates a diagnosis. Instead, CBT is a "problem-focused" and "action-oriented" form of therapy, meaning it is used to treat specific problems related to a diagnosed mental disorder. The therapist's role is to assist the client in finding and practicing effective strategies to address the identified goals and decrease symptoms of the disorder.  CBT is based on the belief that thought distortions and maladaptive behaviors play a role in the development and maintenance of psychological disorders ,  and that symptoms and associated distress can be reduced by teaching new information-processing skills and coping mechanisms.   	3.1529953
Blood transfusion is a medical term. It means a procedure used to transfer blood  from the circulatory system of one human to that of another human. Blood transfusions can save the life of a person, if that person has lost a lot of blood. A person can lose blood from an injury , a trauma or from a medical operation. Blood transfusions can also be applied as a treatment to certain diseases of the blood . Blood is not collected and used immediately.  Instead it is kept until it is needed.  The storage area is informally called a blood bank . By adding anti-coagulant to keep the blood from clotting and refrigerating the blood, it is possible to store it for a few days.  Information about transfusion and donation is available at the National Institutes of Health website  . Not all people are able to donate blood to all other people. Testing for blood types usually prevents any bad reaction to a blood transfusion. However, there are special problems for anyone with rare blood groups. It is very important, in order to avoid any complications during a blood transfusion, to detect individuals with rare blood types. The usual tests for ABO blood group system would show them as group O. It may not be possible to give a blood transfusion at all unless the repository has supply of blood which will not cause a reaction.it donates blood	Blood transfusion is the process of transferring blood products into one's circulation intravenously .  Transfusions are used for various medical conditions to replace lost components of the blood. Early transfusions used whole blood , but modern medical practice commonly uses only components of the blood, such as red blood cells , white blood cells , plasma , clotting factors , and platelets . Red blood cells  contain hemoglobin , and supply the cells of the body with oxygen . White blood cells are not commonly used during transfusion, but are part of the immune system, and fight infections. Plasma is the "yellowish" liquid part of blood, which acts as a buffer, and contains proteins and important substances needed for the body's overall health. Platelets are involved in blood clotting, preventing the body from bleeding. Before these components were known, doctors believed that blood was homogenous. Because of this, many patients died because incompatible blood was transferred to them. Historically, red blood cell transfusion was considered when the hemoglobin level fell below 10 g/dL or hematocrit fell below 30%.   Because each unit of blood given carries risks, a trigger level lower than that, at 7 to 8 g/dL, is now usually used, as it has been shown to have better patient outcomes.   The administration of a single unit of blood is the standard for hospitalized people who are not bleeding, with this treatment followed with re-assessment and consideration of symptoms and hemoglobin concentration.  Patients with poor oxygen saturation may need more blood.  The advisory caution to use blood transfusion only with more severe anemia is in part due to evidence that outcomes are worsened if larger amounts are given.  One may consider transfusion for people with symptoms of cardiovascular disease such as chest pain or shortness of breath.  In cases where patients have low levels of hemoglobin due to iron deficiency, but are cardiovascularly stable, parenteral iron is a preferred option based on both efficacy and safety.  Other blood products are given where appropriate, e.g., to treat clotting deficiencies.	3.1524975
Dialectical behavior therapy  is a form of psychotherapy developed by Marsha M. Linehan , a psychology researcher at the University of Washington . Linehan originally developed DBT to help people with borderline personality disorder .   DBT uses cognitive-behavioral techniques to get patients to control their emotions and test what reality is. It also tests the patient's tolerance for distress , and tries to get them to accept their situation and be aware of their feelings .  Linehan's ideas about how to be aware of your feelings come from Buddhist meditation . DBT may be the first therapy that has been shown to be effective in treating BPD.    It can also help patients with spectrum mood problems, including self-injury .  DBT may help victims of sexual abuse and people addicted to drugs .   In the early 1990’s, Dr. Marsha Linehan developed an alternative therapy to treat her borderline personality disorder patients. Instead of having a one-way conversation with the patient, the therapist would engage him through the use of real world examples to elicit the desired responses. One by one, Linehan was able to teach her patients how to react differently in a variety of situations. This process removes the obstacles to treatment that had confused therapists treating suicidal patients. In a recent study, DBT has proven especially effective in reducing self-injurious behavior, suicide attempts and inpatient treatment days. DBT has also been used to treat alcohol addiction  and drug addiction.	Dialectical behavior therapy  is an evidence-based  psychotherapy that began with efforts to treat borderline personality disorder .  There is evidence that DBT can be useful in treating mood disorders , suicidal ideation , and for change in behavioral patterns such as self-harm and substance use .  DBT evolved into a process in which the therapist and client work with acceptance and change-oriented strategies, and ultimately balance and synthesize them, in a manner comparable to the philosophical dialectical process of hypothesis and antithesis, followed by synthesis.  This approach was developed by Marsha M. Linehan , a psychology researcher at the University of Washington , to help people increase their emotional and cognitive regulation by learning about the triggers that lead to reactive states and helping to assess which coping skills to apply in the sequence of events, thoughts, feelings, and behaviors to help avoid undesired reactions.	3.151372
An oxygen concentrator is a machine that takes in air and takes out some of the nitrogen  so there is more oxygen . This new air with more oxygen is then given to a patient during oxygen therapy .	An oxygen concentrator is a device that concentrates the oxygen from a gas supply  by selectively removing nitrogen to supply an oxygen-enriched product gas stream. Two methods in common use are pressure swing adsorption and membrane gas separation . Home medical oxygen concentrators were invented in the early 1970s, with the manufacturing output of these devices increasing in the late 1970s. Union Carbide Corporation and Bendix Corporation were both early manufacturers. Before that era, home medical oxygen therapy required the use of heavy high-pressure oxygen cylinders or small cryogenic liquid oxygen systems. Both of these delivery systems required frequent home visits by suppliers to replenish oxygen supplies. In the United States, Medicare switched from fee-for-service payment to a flat monthly rate for home oxygen therapy in the mid-1980s, causing the durable medical equipment  industry to rapidly embrace concentrators as a way to control costs. This reimbursement change dramatically decreased the number of primary high pressure and liquid oxygen delivery systems in use in homes in the United States at that time. Oxygen concentrators became the preferred and most common means of delivering home oxygen. The number of manufacturers entering the oxygen concentrator market increased exponentially as a result of this change. Union Carbide Corporation invented the molecular sieve in the 1950s which made these devices possible.  It also invented the first cryogenic liquid home medical oxygen systems in the 1960s.	3.1493204
A fever is when a person's body temperature is hotter than 37.5 degrees Celsius . Normal body temperature for humans varies based on a variety of factors, including age and level of physical activity.  It is typically cited as 37 degrees Celsius , but naturally varies from person to person by at least .5 degrees Celsius. The actual measurement of body temperature will vary based on the location of the measurement.  For a temperature taken from under the tongue , the measurement may be lower. Rectal temperatures will read about 0.3 C  higher, and armpit temperatures will read about the same amount lower. When people are ill, their body's immune system fights the disease , and so the body temperature rises. Fever is a defensive measure of the body against the germs: the life cycles of the germs are disrupted when the body temperature rises. About 38 °C  degrees is called a low-grade fever, and above 39.5 °C  degrees is a high-grade fever. Children usually have a higher fever than adults; their immune system is less mature. Infants have the highest normal temperature, which decreases as people age. Some animals, especially small ones like rabbits and cats , also have a higher normal temperature than humans.	Fever , also referred to as pyrexia , is defined as having a temperature above the normal range due to an increase in the body's temperature set point .    There is not a single agreed-upon upper limit for normal temperature with sources using values between 37.2 and 38.3 °C  in humans.    The increase in set point triggers increased muscle contractions and causes a feeling of cold or chills .  This results in greater heat production and efforts to conserve heat.  When the set point temperature returns to normal, a person feels hot, becomes flushed , and may begin to sweat .  Rarely a fever may trigger a febrile seizure , with this being more common in young children.  Fevers do not typically go higher than 41 to 42 °C .  A fever can be caused by many medical conditions ranging from non-serious to life-threatening .  This includes viral , bacterial , and parasitic infections —such as influenza , the common cold , meningitis , urinary tract infections , appendicitis , COVID-19 , and malaria .   Non-infectious causes include vasculitis , deep vein thrombosis , connective tissue disease , side effects of medication, and cancer .   It differs from hyperthermia , in that hyperthermia is an increase in body temperature over the temperature set point, due to either too much heat production or not enough heat loss . 	3.1405604
The first case of COVID-19 in New Zealand during the 2019–20 COVID-19 pandemic was reported on 28 February 2020. As of 14 May 2020  , the country has a total of 1,497 cases, of which 65 are currently active, and 21 people have died from the virus.  All borders and entry ports of New Zealand were closed to all non-residents at 11:59 pm on 19 March 2020, with returning citizens and residents being required to self-isolate. Since 10 April, all New Zealanders returning from overseas must go into two weeks of quarantine . A four-level alert level system was added on 21 March to manage the outbreak within New Zealand. On 16 March, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern called for an end to public gatherings of more than 500 people and warned that the outbreak could lead to a recession greater than the 2008 global financial crisis .

The cremaster muscle is a muscle that covers the testis and the spermatic cord . The word comes from the transitive Greek verb "I hang" . 	The cremaster muscle is a muscle that covers the testis and the spermatic cord . In human males , the cremaster muscle is a thin layer of striated muscle found in the inguinal canal and scrotum between the external and internal layers of spermatic fascia , surrounding the testis and spermatic cord .  The cremaster muscle is a paired structure, there being one on each side of the body. Anatomically, the lateral cremaster muscle originates from the internal oblique muscle, just superior to the inguinal canal , and the middle of the inguinal ligament. The medial cremaster muscle, which sometimes is absent, originates from the pubic tubercle and sometimes the lateral pubic crest. Both insert into the tunica vaginalis underneath the testis.	3.1362739
In medicine , compliance or adherence refers to the fact that a patient follows the advice of the doctor , and takes the prescribed drugs in the quantities prescribed. Compliance is important for the treatment of chronic diseases . Worldwide, non-compliance is a major obstacle to the effective delivery of health care. In 2003,   the World Health Organization estimated that only about half the patients with chronic diseases living in developed countries follow treatment recommendations.  In particular, low rates of adherence to therapies for asthma , diabetes , and hypertension are thought to contribute substantially to the human and economic burden of those conditions.  Compliance rates may be overestimated in the medical literature, as compliance is often high in the setting of a formal clinical trial but drops off in a "real-world" setting.  Some drugs are difficult to take, because they must be taken at a specific time or interval; sometimes, several drugs must be taken together. This is seen as a major obstacle to compliance.  Other factors that may adversely influence compliance are that many patients do not understand the benefits of being treated, or they see side-effects that they were not told about, the drugs costing a lot of money, poor communication or lack of trust between the patient and their health-care provider.   Efforts to improve compliance have been aimed at simplifying drug packaging, providing effective medication reminders, improving patient education, and limiting the number of medications prescribed at the same time.	In medicine, patient compliance  describes the degree to which a patient correctly follows medical advice. Most commonly, it refers to medication or drug compliance, but it can also apply to other situations such as medical device use, self care , self-directed exercises, or therapy sessions. Both patient and health-care provider affect compliance, and a positive physician-patient relationship is the most important factor in improving compliance,  The cost of prescription medication also plays a major role.  Compliance can be confused with concordance , which is the process by which a patient and clinician make decisions together about treatment.  Worldwide, non-compliance is a major obstacle to the effective delivery of health care. 2003 estimates from the World Health Organization indicated that only about 50% of patients with chronic diseases living in developed countries follow treatment recommendations with particularly low rates of adherence to therapies for asthma , diabetes , and hypertension .  Major barriers to compliance are thought to include the complexity of modern medication regimens, poor "health literacy" and not understanding treatment benefits, occurrence of undiscussed side effects, poor treatment satisfaction, cost of prescription medicine, and poor communication or lack of trust between a patient and his or her health-care provider.     Efforts to improve compliance have been aimed at simplifying medication packaging, providing effective medication reminders, improving patient education, and limiting the number of medications prescribed simultaneously. Studies show a great variation in terms of characteristics and effects of interventions to improve medicine adherence.  It is still unclear how adherence can consistently be improved in order to promote clinically important effects. 	3.132435
Clonus is the name for involuntary rhythmic contractions of muscles or muscle groups. The term is from the Greek for "violent, confused motion".  Cloni can happen as a sign of certain neurological conditions , such as epilepsy , stroke , and multiple sclerosis . They can also be a sign that the spinal cord was damaged. Cloni can also occur as a reaction to certain drugs .	Clonus is a set of involuntary and rhythmic muscular contractions and relaxations. Clonus is a sign of certain neurological conditions, particularly associated with upper motor neuron lesions involving descending motor pathways, and in many cases is, accompanied by spasticity .  Unlike small, spontaneous twitches known as fasciculations , clonus causes large motions that are usually initiated by a reflex . Studies have shown clonus beat frequency to range from three to eight Hz on average, and may last a few seconds to several minutes depending on the patient’s condition.  The term is from the Greek for "violent, confused motion" Clonus is most commonly found at the ankle, specifically with a dorsiflexion/plantarflexion movement .  Some case studies have also reported clonus in the finger, toe, and laterally in the ankle .   Clonus is typically seen in people with cerebral palsy , stroke , multiple sclerosis , spinal cord damage and hepatic encephalopathy .  It can occur in epilepsy as part of a generalized tonic–clonic seizure . It can also be an adverse drug reaction , such as after ingestion of potent serotonergic drugs, where clonus strongly predicts imminent serotonin toxicity .	3.1313128
Alien Hand Syndrome  is a condition that seems to cause a person's hand to move on its own. 	Alien hand syndrome  or Dr. Strangelove syndrome  is a category of conditions in which a person experiences their limbs acting seemingly on their own, without conscious control over the actions.  There are a variety of clinical conditions that fall under this category, which most commonly affects the left hand.  There are many similar terms for the various forms of the condition, but they are often used inappropriately.  The afflicted person may sometimes reach for objects and manipulate them without wanting to do so, even to the point of having to use the controllable hand to restrain the alien hand.  While under normal circumstances, thought, as intent, and action can be assumed to be deeply mutually entangled, the occurrence of alien hand syndrome can be usefully conceptualized as a phenomenon reflecting a functional "disentanglement" between thought and action. Alien hand syndrome is best documented in cases where a person has had the two hemispheres of their brain surgically separated ,  a procedure sometimes used to relieve the symptoms of extreme cases of epilepsy and epileptic psychosis , e.g., temporal lobe epilepsy . It also occurs in some cases after brain surgery , stroke , infection , tumor , aneurysm , migraine and specific degenerative brain conditions such as Alzheimer's disease , Corticobasal degeneration  and Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease .  Other areas of the brain that are associated with alien hand syndrome are the frontal , occipital , and parietal lobes .    "Alien behavior" can be distinguished from reflexive behavior in that the former is flexibly purposive while the latter is obligatory. Sometimes the sufferer will not be aware of what the alien hand is doing until it is brought to his or her attention, or until the hand does something that draws their attention to its behavior. There is a clear distinction between the behaviors of the two hands in which the affected hand is viewed as "wayward" and sometimes "disobedient" and generally out of the realm of their own voluntary control, while the unaffected hand is under normal volitional control. At times, particularly in patients who have sustained damage to the corpus callosum that connects the two cerebral hemispheres , the hands appear to be acting in opposition to each other. 	3.1290696
Duchenne muscular dystrophy  is a severe type of muscular dystrophy . The symptom of muscle weakness usually begins around the age of four in boys and worsens quickly. Most are unable to walk by the age of 12. Scoliosis is also common. The disorder is X-linked recessive . About two thirds of cases are inherited from a person's mother , while one third of cases are due to a new mutation . It is caused by a mutation in the gene for the protein dystrophin . Although there is no known cure, physical therapy , braces , and corrective surgery may help with some symptoms. 	Duchenne muscular dystrophy  is a severe type of muscular dystrophy that primarily affects boys.  Muscle weakness usually begins around the age of four, and worsens quickly.  Muscle loss typically occurs first in the thighs and pelvis followed by the arms.  This can result in trouble standing up.  Most are unable to walk by the age of 12.  Affected muscles may look larger due to increased fat content.  Scoliosis is also common.  Some may have intellectual disability .  Females with a single copy of the defective gene may show mild symptoms.  The disorder is X-linked recessive .  About two thirds of cases are inherited from a person's mother, while one third of cases are due to a new mutation .  It is caused by a mutation in the gene for the protein dystrophin .  Dystrophin is important to maintain the muscle fiber's cell membrane .  Genetic testing can often make the diagnosis at birth.  Those affected also have a high level of creatine kinase in their blood .  Although there is no known cure, physical therapy , braces , and corrective surgery may help with some symptoms.  Assisted ventilation may be required in those with weakness of breathing muscles .  Medications used include steroids to slow muscle degeneration, anticonvulsants to control seizures and some muscle activity, and immunosuppressants to delay damage to dying muscle cells .  Gene therapy , as a treatment, is in the early stages of study in humans.  A small initial study using gene therapy has given some children improved muscle strength, but long term effects are unknown as of 2020. 	3.1234353
PubMed is a free online database of references on life sciences .  It was established in January 1996.  The United States National Library of Medicine  at the National Institutes of Health  maintains the database.  Each record in the PubMed database is assigned a special number to identify it.  This is the PMID , an acronym for " P ub M ed ID entifier" number.  PMIDs do not change over time and they are never reused.  Any PMID is only a number. The PMID tells the reader nothing about the type or quality of the content of any publication.	PubMed is a free search engine accessing primarily the MEDLINE database of references and abstracts on life sciences and biomedical topics. The United States National Library of Medicine  at the National Institutes of Health maintain the database as part of the Entrez system of information retrieval .  From 1971 to 1997, online access to the MEDLINE database had been primarily through institutional facilities, such as university libraries .  PubMed, first released in January 1996, ushered in the era of private, free, home- and office-based MEDLINE searching.

Fibromyalgia is a condition with chronic pain . The exact causes are not known. However, symptoms are not totally restricted to the pain. There are also sleep disturbances, joint stiffness and severe fatigue. The problem sometimes exists along with depression , stress and anxiety . Fibromyalgia affects mostly women, though men can also be affected. Adults are usually the victims, although children may also be affected.  symptoms- widespread pain,if you have fibromyalgia,one of the main symptoms is most likely to be widespread pain... Extreme sensitivity... Stiffness... fatigue... poor sleep quality... congnitive prombles 	Fibromyalgia  is a medical condition characterized by chronic widespread pain and a heightened pain response to pressure .  Other symptoms include tiredness to a degree that normal activities are affected, sleep problems and troubles with memory .  Some people also report restless legs syndrome , bowel or bladder problems , numbness and tingling and sensitivity to noise, lights or temperature.  Fibromyalgia is frequently associated with depression , anxiety and posttraumatic stress disorder .  Other types of chronic pain are also frequently present.  The cause of fibromyalgia is unknown; however, it is believed to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors.   The condition runs in families and many genes are believed to be involved.  Environmental factors may include psychological stress , trauma , and certain infections .  The pain appears to result from processes in the central nervous system and the condition is referred to as a "central sensitization syndrome".   Fibromyalgia is recognized as a disorder in both the U.S. by the US National Institutes of Health and the American College of Rheumatology ,   and in Canada by the Canadian Rheumatology Association and the Canadian Pain Society.  There is no specific diagnostic test,  although as of 2020, several diagnostic blood tests were in the process of moving towards certification and wider use for diagnosing fibromyalgia in conjunction with a physical examination.   Nonetheless, all forms of diagnosis involve first ruling out other potential causes and verifying that a set number of symptoms are present.  	3.1209457
In medicine the term comorbidity is used to describe diseases and conditions that often occur together with another disease or condition. The first disease or disorder is called primary . In many cases, the primary condition or disease does not cause the comorbid disorders. However, they may both be caused or partly caused by the same thing, for example a genetic mutation or a traumatic experience. As an example, a patient may have antisocial personality disorder and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder . The two conditions are comorbid . Another patient might suffer from borderline personality disorder , posttraumatic stress disorder and bipolar disorder . The three conditions are comorbid .	In medicine , comorbidity is the presence of one or more additional conditions often co-occurring  with a primary condition. Comorbidity describes the effect of all other conditions an individual patient might have other than the primary condition of interest, and can be physiological or psychological. In the context of mental health, comorbidity often refers to disorders that are often coexistent with each other, such as depression and anxiety disorders. Comorbidity can indicate either a condition existing simultaneously, but independently with another condition or a related medical condition. The latter sense of the term causes some overlap with the concept of complications . For example, in longstanding diabetes mellitus , the extent to which coronary artery disease is an independent comorbidity versus a diabetic complication is not easy to measure, because both diseases are quite multivariate and there are likely aspects of both simultaneity and consequence. The same is true of intercurrent diseases in pregnancy . In other examples, the true independence or relation is not ascertainable because syndromes and associations are often identified long before pathogenetic commonalities are confirmed . In psychiatric diagnoses it has been argued in part that this "'use of imprecise language may lead to correspondingly imprecise thinking',  this usage of the term 'comorbidity' should probably be avoided."  However, in many medical examples, such as comorbid diabetes mellitus and coronary artery disease, it makes little difference which word is used, as long as the medical complexity is duly recognized and addressed. Many tests attempt to standardize the "weight" or value of comorbid conditions, whether they are secondary or tertiary illnesses. Each test attempts to consolidate each individual comorbid condition into a single, predictive variable that measures mortality or other outcomes. Researchers have validated such tests because of their predictive value, but no one test is as yet recognized as a  standard.	3.1203187

Ayurveda   is an alternative medicine system from the Indian subcontinent .  Ayurveda is .    The Indian Medical Association  says the practice of modern medicine by Ayurveda is quackery .  Ayurvedic texts say that the gods of Hindu mythology gave medical knowledge to legendary Hindu philosophers , who then gave the knowledge to human physicians .  The word "ayurveda" is from the Sanskrit : आयुर्वेद , Āyurveda , and means knowledge of life and longevity .  In Ayurveda, the story is that Dhanvantari , the Hindu god of Ayurveda, made himself into a human king by incarnation . He was king of Varanasi , and taught Ayurvedic medicine to a group of physicians. One of these physicians, named Sushruta, wrote the Sushruta Samhita , an Ayurvedic text that has this story in it.   Most Ayurvedic therapies are made from chemical compounds taken from plants, from minerals , and from metals . In ancient India , Ayurvedic texts gave explanations for surgeries and for the stitching of wounds to help wound healing . The ancient Indians knew how to take out kidney stones and how to do rhinoplasty .   People have used many different Ayurvedic therapies through the history of India . Ayurveda has changed for more than two thousand years.  In the 1970s and 1980s, Ayurveda also changed for consumption in the Western world . Some people say Ayurveda comes from Prehistory .   Some ideas in Ayurveda may have been in existence at the time of the Indus Valley civilization , during the Bronze Age in India.  During the Vedic period , Ayurveda went through many developments. Outside the tradition of the Vedas , Buddhism and Jainism also shared some ideas with the Ayurvedic texts from ancient India.  By around two thousand years ago, Ayurveda had developed some of its ideas for surgery and drugs .  There is no good evidence that works or helps for any disease .  Some Ayurvedic products have lead , mercury , and arsenic in them.  In 2008, nearly 21% of Ayurvedic products sold on the internet and made in India and the United States had in them lead , mercury , and arsenic  in quantities that are toxic .  There may be public health dangers that result from this, but that is not known. 	Ayurveda   is an alternative medicine system with historical roots in the Indian subcontinent.  The theory and practice of Ayurveda is pseudoscientific .    The Indian Medical Association  characterises the practice of medicine by Ayurvedic practitioners as quackery .  Ayurveda is heavily practiced in India and Nepal, where around 80% of the population report using it.     Ayurveda therapies have varied and evolved over more than two millennia.  Therapies include medicines, special diets, meditation, yoga, massage, laxatives, enemas, and medical oils.   Medicines are typically based on complex herbal compounds, minerals, and metal substances . Ancient Ayurveda texts also taught surgical techniques, including rhinoplasty , kidney stone extractions , sutures, and the extraction of foreign objects.  	3.1159906
Glasgow Coma Scale or GCS is a scale that is used to measure the consciousness of a person. It was invented in 1974 by Graham Teasdale and Bryan J. Jennett , professors of neurosurgery at the University of Glasgow. GCS is used in evaluation of patients, especially in ICUs . This scale consists of three tests, which are described below. A score is given for each test, and the GCS score is calculated by adding the scores given to each test. The maximum score is 15, which means the patient is fully conscious. The minimum score is 3, and is usually seen in patients with brain death or those in deep coma . The scale comprises three tests: eye , verbal  and motor  responses. There are 4 grades for this test:	The Glasgow Coma Scale   is a clinical scale used to reliably measure a person's level of consciousness after a brain injury . The GCS assesses a person based on their ability to perform eye movements, speak, and move their body. These three behaviors make up the three elements of the scale: eye, verbal, and motor. A person's GCS score can range from 3  to 15 . This score is used to guide immediate medical care after a brain injury  and also to monitor hospitalized patients and track their level of consciousness. Lower GCS scores are correlated with higher risk of death. However, the GCS score alone should not be used on its own to predict the outcome for an individual person with brain injury.	3.1103399
The term flat feet  is a medical condition in which human foot arches are very low or the entire sole of the human foot is touching the ground. Flat feet in children may become regular arches later on.  Adults with this condition may have problems involving arch development. The opposite, less common condition is called high arch .	Flat feet  is a postural deformity in which the arches of the foot collapse, with the entire sole of the foot coming into complete or near-complete contact with the ground. There is a functional relationship between the structure of the arch of the foot and the biomechanics of the lower leg. The arch provides an elastic, springy connection between the forefoot and the hind foot so that a majority of the forces incurred during weight bearing on the foot can be dissipated before the force reaches the long bones of the leg and thigh.  In pes planus, the head of the talus bone is displaced medially and distal from the navicular bone . As a result, the Plantar calcaneonavicular ligament  and the tendon of the tibialis posterior muscle are stretched to the extent that the individual with pes planus loses the function of the medial longitudinal arch . If the MLA is absent or nonfunctional in both the seated and standing positions, the individual has “rigid” flatfoot. If the MLA is present and functional while the individual is sitting or standing up on their toes, but this arch disappears when assuming a foot-flat stance, the individual has “supple” flatfoot. This latter condition is often treated with arch supports.  However, a recent randomized controlled trial found no evidence for the efficacy of treatment of flat feet in children either from expensive prescribed orthotics  or less expensive over-the-counter orthotics.  Three studies  of military recruits have shown no evidence of increased injury, or foot problems, due to flat feet, in a population of people who reach military service age without prior foot problems. However, these studies cannot be used to judge possible future damage from this condition when diagnosed at younger ages. They also cannot be applied to persons whose flat feet are associated with foot symptoms, or certain symptoms in other parts of the body  possibly referable to the foot.	3.1098318
Cyclophosphamide is a drug used in the treatment of lymphoma, some types of leukemia , and some solid cancers, as well as for some forms of Nephritis , Rheumatoid arthritis , and multiple sclerosis .	Cyclophosphamide , also known as cytophosphane among other names,  is a medication used as chemotherapy and to suppress the immune system .  As chemotherapy it is used to treat lymphoma , multiple myeloma , leukemia , ovarian cancer , breast cancer , small cell lung cancer , neuroblastoma , and sarcoma .  As an immune suppressor it is used in nephrotic syndrome , granulomatosis with polyangiitis , and following organ transplant , among other conditions.   It is taken by mouth or injection into a vein .  Most people develop side effects.  Common side effects include low white blood cell counts , loss of appetite, vomiting, hair loss , and bleeding from the bladder .  Other severe side effects include an increased future risk of cancer, infertility , allergic reactions , and pulmonary fibrosis .  Cyclophosphamide is in the alkylating agent and nitrogen mustard family of medications.  It is believed to work by interfering with the duplication of DNA and the creation of RNA .  Cyclophosphamide was approved for medical use in the United States in 1959.  It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines . 	3.1074524
The 501Y.V2 variant , also known as South African COVID-19 variant , is a variant of the SARS-CoV-2 , the virus that causes COVID-19 . It is one of several SARS-CoV-2 variants. It was first detected in the Nelson Mandela Bay  metropolitan area of the Eastern Cape province of South Africa . On 23 December 2020, the United Kingdom health minister Matt Hancock said that two people who had travelled from South Africa to the United Kingdom were infected with the 501.V2.  On 28 December, the variant was detected in two people in Switzerland  and one in Finland .  The United States reported its first cases of the variant in the U.S. state of South Carolina . 	Lineage B.1.351  is a variant of SARS-CoV-2 , the virus that causes COVID-19 . One of several SARS-CoV-2 variants believed to be of particular importance , it was first detected in the Nelson Mandela Bay  metropolitan area of the Eastern Cape province of South Africa in October 2020,  which was reported by the country's health department on 18 December 2020.  Phylogeographic analysis suggests this variant emerged in the Nelson Mandela Bay already in July or August 2020.  A genomics team lead by the KwaZulu-Natal Research Innovation and Sequencing Platform  at the University of KwaZulu-Natal discovered the new variant.  It was uncovered by whole genome sequencing . Several genomic sequences from this lineage were submitted to the GISAID sequence database.  	3.1072788

Somnolence  is a strong desire for sleep . It is also sleeping for unusually long periods. It can refer to the usual state before falling asleep. It can be accompanied by lethargy , weakness and difficulty thinking.  Sleepiness can be dangerous when performing tasks that require constant concentration, such as driving a vehicle .	Somnolence  is a state of strong desire for sleep , or sleeping for unusually long periods . It has distinct meanings and causes. It can refer to the usual state preceding falling asleep ,  the condition of being in a drowsy state due to circadian rhythm disorders, or a symptom of other health problems. It can be accompanied by lethargy , weakness, and lack of mental agility.  Somnolence is often viewed as a symptom rather than a disorder by itself. However, the concept of somnolence recurring at certain times for certain reasons constitutes various disorders, such as excessive daytime sleepiness , shift work sleep disorder , and others; and there are medical codes for somnolence as viewed as a disorder. Sleepiness can be dangerous when performing tasks that require constant concentration, such as driving a vehicle. When a person is sufficiently fatigued , microsleeps may be experienced. In individuals deprived of sleep, somnolence may spontaneously dissipate for short periods of time; this phenomenon is the second wind , and results from the normal cycling of the circadian rhythm interfering with the processes the body carries out to prepare itself to rest.	3.1069608
Dilation and Curettage  is a type of surgery used to diagnose and treat problems with woman's uterus . During a D&C, a doctor will do these things:  A D&C can be used for many reasons.  For example: 	Dilation  and curettage  refers to the dilation  of the cervix and surgical removal of part of the lining of the uterus and/or contents of the uterus by scraping and scooping . It is a gynecologic procedure used for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, and is the most commonly used method for first trimester miscarriage or abortion .     D&C normally refers to a procedure involving a curette , also called sharp curettage .  However, some sources use the term D&C to refer to any procedure that involves the processes of dilation and removal of uterine contents, which includes the more common suction curettage procedures of manual and electric vacuum aspiration .  D&Cs may be performed in pregnant and non-pregnant patients, for different clinical indications.	3.1066134
Amyloidosis is a rare and serious disease that could be fatal that is caused by accumulation of proteins in the form of abnormal, insoluble fibres, known as amyloid fibrils, within the tissues of the body.   Amyloid deposits can be confined to only one part of the body or a single organ system in 'local amyloidosis' or they can be widely distributed in organs and tissues throughout the body in 'systemic amyloidosis'. The symptoms of amyloidosis are accordingly highly variable and confirmation of the presence of amyloid in the tissues can be challenging, so that diagnosis is often delayed. There are many different types of amyloidosis, each caused by formation of amyloid fibrils from different soluble precursor proteins in different patients.   About 30 different proteins are known to form amyloid fibrils in humans  and amyloidosis is named and classified according to the identity of the respective fibril protein.  Though this disease being rare, many famous people have died from this disease such as: Martin McGuinness , David Lange , Robert Jordan and Robert P. Casey .	Amyloidosis is a group of diseases in which abnormal proteins , known as amyloid fibrils , build up in tissue.  There are several types with varying symptoms; signs and symptoms may include diarrhea , weight loss, feeling tired, enlargement of the tongue, bleeding, numbness, feeling faint with standing , swelling of the legs, or enlargement of the spleen.  There are about 30 different types of amyloidosis, each due to a specific protein misfolding .  Some are genetic while others are acquired.  They are grouped into localized forms , and systemic ones.  The four most common types of systemic amyloidosis are light chain  , inflammation , dialysis-related , and hereditary and old age .  Diagnosis may be suspected when protein is found in the urine , organ enlargement is present, or problems are found with multiple peripheral nerves and it is unclear why.  Diagnosis is confirmed by tissue biopsy .  Due to the variable presentation, a diagnosis can often take some time to reach. 	3.1057322
Blood donation is when a person voluntarily gives blood, which can be used for blood transfusions or to make certain drugs . Blood banks store this blood. The blood can be used to help the victims of accidents , for example. Usually, the blood donor and the donated blood are tested for diseases which spread through the blood. These include various forms of Hepatitis , HIV and Syphilis . Usually a series of questions also need to be answered to make sure that there is no risk to the person donating. A special case of blood donation sometimes occurs before a medical operation that is dangerous. People donate their own blood, which can be used after the operation if they lose too much blood.	A blood donation occurs when a person voluntarily has blood drawn and used for transfusions and/or made into biopharmaceutical medications by a process called fractionation . Donation may be of whole blood, or of specific components directly . Blood banks often participate in the collection process as well as the procedures that follow it. Today in the developed world , most blood donors are unpaid volunteers who donate blood for a community supply. In some countries, established supplies are limited and donors usually give blood when family or friends need a transfusion .  Many donors donate for several reasons, such as a form of charity, general awareness regarding the demand for blood, increased confidence in oneself, helping a personal friend or relative, and social pressure.  Despite the many reasons that people donate, not enough potential donors actively donate.  However, this is reversed during disasters when blood donations increase, often creating an excess supply that will have to be later discarded.  However, in countries that allow paid donation some people are paid, and in some cases there are incentives other than money such as paid time off from work. People can also have blood drawn for their own future use . Donating is relatively safe, but some donors have bruising where the needle is inserted or may feel faint. Potential donors are evaluated for anything that might make their blood unsafe to use. The screening includes testing for diseases that can be transmitted by a blood transfusion, including HIV and viral hepatitis . The donor must also answer questions about medical history and take a short physical examination to make sure the donation is not hazardous to his or her health. How often a donor can donate varies from days to months based on what component they donate and the laws of the country where the donation takes place. For example, in the United States, donors must wait 56 days  between whole-blood donations but only seven days between platelet apheresis donations  and twice per seven-day period in plasmapheresis .	3.1046765
Gangliogliomas are tumors that start from groups of nerve cells  and grow in the brain . They are usually small and noncancerous, and they do not spread to other parts of the body. Gangliogliomas are rare tumors. Most gangliogliomas occur in children and young adults. Seizures , headache , vomiting , fatigue and weakness on one side of the body.	Ganglioglioma is a rare, slow-growing primary central nervous system  tumor which most frequently occurs in the temporal lobes of children and young adults.  Gangliogliomas are generally benign WHO grade I tumors ; the presence of anaplastic changes in the glial component is considered to represent WHO grade III . Criteria for WHO grade II have been suggested, but are not established. Malignant transformation of spinal ganglioglioma has been seen in only a select few cases.  Poor prognostic factors for adults with gangliogliomas include older age at diagnosis, male sex, and malignant histologic features. Histologically, ganglioglioma is composed of both neoplastic glial and ganglion cells which are disorganized, variably cellular, and non-infiltrative. Occasionally, it may be challenging to differentiate ganglion cell tumors from an infiltrating glioma with entrapped neurons. The presence of neoplastic ganglion cells forming abnormal clusters , the presence of binucleation and dysmorphic neurons are helpful clues favoring ganglioglioma over glioma. The glial component of ganglioglioma includes fibrillary astrocytes with varying degrees of cellular atypia . The neoplastic neuronal components are often clustered or irregularly oriented. Fibrovascular stroma confined to the neuronal component, perivascular lymphocytic infiltrates, and small foci of calcification are common, as is immunopositivity for synaptophysin , neuron-specific enolase, and chromogranin A . Elevated Ki-67 and p53 labeling index is associated with more aggressive tumor behavior in both children and adults with gangliogliomas. The rare occurrence of malignant transformation is confined to the glial cell population, and is characterized by increased cellularity and mitotic activity , endothelial proliferation, and necrosis.	3.098966
A fugue state   is a rare psychiatric disorder . It involves temporary loss of memory . It usually only lasts a short time , but can last months or longer. In a fugue state, the person not only forgets all about who they are, but may suddenly adopt a new identity . They may leave home and wander , settle in another area with a new name. Fugue occurs to avoid stress and anxiety . After the fugue state comes to an end, the person recovers the memories they lost, but usually forgets all that happened during the fugue.	Dissociative fugue , formerly fugue state or psychogenic fugue , is a dissociative disorder  and a rare psychiatric disorder characterized by reversible amnesia for personal identity, including the memories , personality , and other identifying characteristics of individuality . The state can last days, months or longer. Dissociative fugue usually involves unplanned travel or wandering and is sometimes accompanied by the establishment of a new identity. It is a facet of dissociative amnesia , according to the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders . After recovery from a fugue state, previous memories usually return intact, and further treatment is unnecessary. Additionally, an episode of fugue is not characterized as attributable to a psychiatric disorder if it can be related to the ingestion of psychotropic substances, to physical trauma, to a general medical condition, or to dissociative identity disorder ,  delirium , or dementia .  Fugues are precipitated by a series of long-term traumatic episodes. It is most commonly associated with childhood victims of sexual abuse who learn over time to dissociate memory of the abuse . Symptoms of a dissociative fugue include mild confusion and once the fugue ends, possible depression , grief, shame, and discomfort. People have also experienced a post-fugue anger .  Another symptom of the fugue state can consist of loss of one's identity. 	3.0978425
Sore throat or throat pain is pain in a person's throat . About 7.5% or ​ 3 ⁄ 40 of people have sore throat in any three-month period. Most of the time, it is caused by viral pharyngitis . It can also be caused by bad tonsils , trauma , strep throat , tumors , and other problems. Treatment varies with the different causes, but the painful symptoms can be helped with medicine such as cough drops or, in China , pear-syrup candy .	Sore throat , also known as throat pain , is pain or irritation of the throat . Sore throat is usually caused by a viral infection or a group A streptococcus  bacterial infection.  Other causes include pharyngitis , tonsillitis , or dehydration , which leads to the throat drying up. It can also result from trauma . The majority of sore throats are caused by a virus, for which antibiotics are not helpful.  A strong association between antibiotic misuse and antibiotic resistance has been shown.  For sore throat caused by bacteria , treatment with antibiotics may help the person get better faster, reduce the risk that the bacterial infection does not spread, prevent retropharyngeal abscesses and quinsy , and reduce the risk of other complications such as rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease .  In most developed countries , post-streptococcal diseases have become far less common. For this reason, awareness and public health initiatives to promote minimizing the use of antibiotics for viral infections has become the focus.  Approximately 35% of childhood sore throats and 5-25% of adults sore throats are caused by a bacterial infection from group A streptococcus.  Sore throats that are "non-group A streptococcus" are assumed to be caused by a viral infection. Sore throat is a common reason for people to visit their primary care doctors and the top reason for antibiotic prescriptions by primary care practitioners such as family doctors.  In the United States, about 1% of all visits to the hospital emergency department, physician office and medical clinics, and outpatient clinics are for sore throat . 	3.0946414
Antacids  are used to help stop indigestion .  People may get indigestion if they eat too much or if they have eaten too fast. With indigestion, the liquid in the stomach will become more acidic. Antacids will neutralise the acids. The reaction that is happening is called neutralisation . This is because the tablets are alkaline and the liquids in the stomach are acidic. This reaction between the stomach acids and the antacid will make the acid change into harmless substances such as water or salt. An example of an antacid is milk of magnesia . Side effects from taking antacids are rare, but can include both constipation and diarrhea .  They are also high in sodium so people with a heart condition on a low salt diet should ask their doctor before taking them. 	An antacid is a substance which neutralizes stomach acidity and is used to relieve heartburn , indigestion or an upset stomach.  Some antacids have been used in the treatment of constipation and diarrhea .  Currently marketed antacids contain salts of aluminum , calcium , magnesium , or sodium .  Some preparations contain a combination of two salts, such as magnesium carbonate and aluminum hydroxide .  Antacids are available over the counter and are taken by mouth to quickly relieve occasional heartburn , the major symptom of gastroesophageal reflux disease and indigestion . Treatment with antacids alone is symptomatic and only justified for minor symptoms.  Alternative uses for antacids include constipation, diarrhea,  hyperphosphatemia, and urinary alkalization.  Some antacids are also used as an adjunct to pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy in the treatment of pancreatic insufficiency .  Non-particulate antacids  increase gastric pH with little or no effect on gastric volume, and therefore may see some limited use in pre-operative procedures. Sodium citrate should be given within 1 hour of surgery to be the most effective. 	3.0913465
Social distancing , also less confusingly called physical distancing is one way to help stop the spread of infection from viruses and bacteria between people. The goal is to lower the chance for an infection to spread from person to person. This can reduce the number of infected people at one time, which lowers the burden on health care. By lowering the number of people who get sick, lives can also be saved.   Social distancing works for infections that are spread by droplets , physical contact, contaminated surfaces, or in the air.  Social distancing does not work well for infections that are spread through food, water, or insects.  Types of social distancing are: All of these may have negative effects on people.    However, these may be preferred to the effects of a specific disease.	In public health, social distancing , also called physical distancing ,    is a set of non-pharmaceutical interventions or measures intended to prevent the spread of a contagious disease by maintaining a physical distance between people and reducing the number of times people come into close contact with each other.   It usually involves keeping a certain distance from others  and avoiding gathering together in large groups.   By minimising the probability that a given uninfected person will come into physical contact with an infected person, the disease transmission can be suppressed, resulting in fewer deaths .  The measures may be used in combination with others, such as good respiratory hygiene , face masks and hand washing .   To slow down the spread of infectious diseases and avoid overburdening healthcare systems, particularly during a pandemic , several social-distancing measures are used, including the closing of schools and workplaces, isolation , quarantine , restricting the movement of people and the cancellation of mass gatherings .   Drawbacks of social distancing can include loneliness , reduced productivity and the loss of other benefits associated with human interaction . 	3.086641
Amphetamine mixed salts  is a medication used in the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder  and narcolepsy .  It is sold under the brand name Adderall . The drug contains a mixture of the salts of amphetamine and dextroamphetamine . Both of these salts act as stimulants . The drug therefore helps people stay alert and concentrate on what they are doing. The downside of this medication is decreased fatigue, and decreased appetite. The sustained-release  formulation is sold under the brand name Adderall XR. This formulation is designed to provide therapeutic effect and plasma concentrations. This is the same as taking two doses 4 hours apart.  The normal dosage of Adderall XR is 20 milligrams. Adderall is a DEA Schedule II controlled substances. Its Schedule II status indicates its potential for abuse and dependence. While it does have medicinal use, abuse of the drug may lead to an addiction, clinically termed a stimulant use disorder. 	Adderall and Mydayis  are trade names  for a combination drug containing four salts of amphetamine . The mixture is composed of equal parts racemic amphetamine and dextroamphetamine , which produces a  ratio between dextroamphetamine and levoamphetamine , the two enantiomers of amphetamine. Both enantiomers are stimulants , but differ enough to give Adderall an effects profile distinct from those of racemic amphetamine or dextroamphetamine,   which are marketed as Evekeo and Dexedrine/Zenzedi, respectively.    Adderall is used in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder  and narcolepsy . It is also used as an athletic performance enhancer , cognitive enhancer , appetite suppressant , and recreationally as an aphrodisiac and euphoriant . It is a central nervous system  stimulant of the phenethylamine class .  Adderall is generally well tolerated and effective in treating the symptoms of ADHD and narcolepsy. At therapeutic doses, Adderall causes emotional and cognitive effects such as euphoria , change in sex drive , increased wakefulness , and improved cognitive control . At these doses, it induces physical effects such as a faster reaction time, fatigue resistance, and increased muscle strength. In contrast, much larger doses of Adderall can impair cognitive control, cause rapid muscle breakdown , provoke panic attacks , or induce a psychosis . The side effects of Adderall vary widely among individuals, but most commonly include insomnia , dry mouth , loss of appetite , and weight loss . The risk of developing an addiction or dependence is insignificant when Adderall is used as prescribed at fairly low daily doses, such as those used for treating ADHD; however, the routine use of Adderall in larger daily doses poses a significant risk of addiction or dependence due to the pronounced reinforcing effects that are present at high doses. Recreational doses of amphetamine are generally much larger than prescribed therapeutic doses , and carry a far greater risk of serious adverse effects. 	3.0857055
Autotransplantation is transplanting tissues from one part of the body to another part of the same person. Skin grafts are a common example. Another example: a piece of bone  is removed and ground into a paste when reconstructing another portion of bone.	Autotransplantation is the transplantation of organs , tissues , or even particular proteins from one part of the body to another in the same person . The autologous tissue  transplanted by such a procedure is called an autograft or autotransplant .  It is contrasted with allotransplantation , Syngeneic transplantation  and xenotransplantation .	3.0836666
The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders   is a guide to grouping mental disorders . It is published by the American Psychiatric Association . It is used in the United States and around the world by doctors , researchers, health insurance companies, companies which make medicine, and others. There have been five revisions since it was first published in 1952. Each time, more mental disorders were added, although some have been removed and are no longer seen as mental disorders. An example of this is homosexuality. The manual was developed from systems for collecting census and psychiatric hospital statistics , and from a manual written by the US Army . A lot of changes were made to it in 1980. The last time it was greatly changed was the fourth edition , published in 1994, but small changes to text were made in a 2000 version. The fifth edition  was published May 2013. The DSM has been criticized for being too influenced by the drug industry. The International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems , ICD, has a section about mental and behavioral disorders which is different from the DSM. The ICD, not the DSM, is the system used by the United States government. 	The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders  is a publication by the American Psychiatric Association  for the classification of mental disorders using a common language and standard criteria. It is used - mainly in the USA - by clinicians, researchers, psychiatric drug regulation agencies, health insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies , the legal system, and policymakers. The DSM evolved from systems for collecting census and psychiatric hospital statistics, as well as from a United States Army manual. Revisions since its first publication in 1952 have incrementally added to the total number of mental disorders , while removing those no longer considered to be mental disorders.	3.0820744
Fluoxetine hydrochloride is an antidepressant medication . It is used as a drug against various illnesses, like depression , obsessive-compulsive disorder , Panic disorder , and other illnesses. Fluoxetine is a one of a group of antidepressants called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors . It is commonly known as Prozac . There are newer drugs available to treat these conditions. Nevertheless, it remains very popular. Over 23.1 million prescriptions for fluoxetine were filled in the United States in 2006. This makes it the third most prescribed antidepressant. 	Fluoxetine , sold under the brand names Prozac and Sarafem among others, is an antidepressant of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor  class.  It is used for the treatment of major depressive disorder , obsessive–compulsive disorder , bulimia nervosa , panic disorder , and premenstrual dysphoric disorder .  It is also approved for treatment of major depressive disorder in adolescents and children 8 years of age and over.  It has also been used to treat premature ejaculation .  Fluoxetine is taken by mouth .  Common side effects include indigestion, trouble sleeping, sexual dysfunction, loss of appetite, dry mouth, and  rash. Serious side effects include serotonin syndrome , mania , seizures , an increased risk of suicidal behavior in people under 25 years old, and an increased risk of bleeding.  Discontinuation syndrome is less likely to occur with fluoxetine than with other antidepressants, but it still happens in many cases. Fluoxetine taken during pregnancy is associated with significant increase in congenital heart defects in the newborns.   It has been suggested that fluoxetine therapy may be continued during breastfeeding if it was used during pregnancy or if other antidepressants were ineffective.  Its mechanism of action is unknown, but some hypothesize that it is related to serotonin activity in the brain.	3.0819902
Amnesia is a what doctors call a loss or disturbance of memory . It is a loss of memory, that is to say, a person cannot remember certain things. Amnesia can be caused when someone has brain damage , a disease or when something really stressful happens. There are two "main types": The fact that adults usually cannot remember events that occurred in early childhood is called "infantile amnesia". It is attributed to the development of the brain or that of the child. It is not seen as a form of amnesia comparable to the other types. There are three main categories in which amnesia can happen to a person.	Amnesia is a deficit in memory caused by brain damage or disease,  but it can also be caused temporarily by the use of various sedatives and hypnotic drugs . The memory can be either wholly or partially lost due to the extent of damage that was caused.  There are two main types of amnesia: retrograde amnesia and anterograde amnesia . Retrograde amnesia is the inability to retrieve information that was acquired before a particular date, usually the date of an accident or operation.  In some cases the memory loss can extend back decades, while in others the person may lose only a few months of memory. Anterograde amnesia is the inability to transfer new information from the short-term store into the long-term store. People with anterograde amnesia cannot remember things for long periods of time. These two types are not mutually exclusive; both can occur simultaneously.  Case studies also show that amnesia is typically associated with damage to the medial temporal lobe . In addition, specific areas of the hippocampus  are involved with memory. Research has also shown that when areas of the diencephalon are damaged, amnesia can occur. Recent studies have shown a correlation between deficiency of RbAp48 protein and memory loss . Scientists were able to find that mice with damaged memory have a lower level of RbAp48 protein compared to normal, healthy mice.   In people suffering with amnesia, the ability to recall immediate information is still retained,     and they may still be able to form new memories. However, a severe reduction in the ability to learn new material and retrieve old information can be observed. Patients can learn new procedural knowledge. In addition, priming  can assist amnesiacs in the learning of fresh non-declarative knowledge.  Amnesic patients also retain substantial intellectual, linguistic, and social skill despite profound impairments in the ability to recall specific information encountered in prior learning episodes.   	3.0808914
Childbed fever is an bacterial infection of the female reproductive tract, which occurs after a woman has given birth or after a miscarriage . It is also known as postpartum infection , or puerperal fever . In the developed world, it affects about one to two percent of all births. It can develop into a life-threatening sepsis . Cesarean section is one of the risk factors. For this reason, all women undergoing a Cesarean section receive antibiotics .	Postpartum infections , also known as childbed fever and puerperal fever , are any bacterial infections of the female reproductive tract following childbirth or miscarriage .  Signs and symptoms usually include a fever greater than 38.0 °C , chills, lower abdominal pain, and possibly bad-smelling vaginal discharge .  It usually occurs after the first 24 hours and within the first ten days following delivery.  The most common infection is that of the uterus and surrounding tissues known as puerperal sepsis , postpartum metritis , or postpartum endometritis .   Risk factors include Caesarean section , the presence of certain bacteria such as group B streptococcus in the vagina, premature rupture of membranes , multiple vaginal exams , manual removal of the placenta , and prolonged labour among others.   Most infections involve a number of types of bacteria.  Diagnosis is rarely helped by culturing of the vagina or blood.  In those who do not improve, medical imaging may be required.  Other causes of fever following delivery include breast engorgement , urinary tract infections , infections of an abdominal incision or an episiotomy , and atelectasis .   Due to the risks following Caesarean section, it is recommended that all women receive a preventive dose of antibiotics such as ampicillin around the time of surgery.  Treatment of established infections is with antibiotics, with most people improving in two to three days.  In those with mild disease, oral antibiotics may be used; otherwise intravenous antibiotics are recommended.  Common antibiotics include a combination of ampicillin and gentamicin following vaginal delivery or clindamycin and gentamicin in those who have had a C-section.  In those who are not improving with appropriate treatment, other complications such an abscess should be considered. 	3.0805879
Physical dependence is a term used in medicine : If a drug is taken regularly, a certain level of tolerance may have developed. Abruptly stopping to use the drug will cause drug withdrawal symptoms. If the drug has been taken for a longer period of time, or the dosage was higher, the withdrawal symptoms will be more severe. Well known drugs with withdrawal symptoms include opioids , alcohol , and may of the drugs knownn as neuroleptics .	Physical dependence is a physical condition caused by chronic use of a tolerance -forming drug, in which abrupt or gradual drug withdrawal causes unpleasant physical symptoms.   Physical dependence can develop from low-dose therapeutic use of certain medications such as benzodiazepines, opioids, antiepileptics and antidepressants, as well as the recreational misuse of drugs such as alcohol, opioids and benzodiazepines. The higher the dose used, the greater the duration of use, and the earlier age use began are predictive of worsened physical dependence and thus more severe withdrawal syndromes. Acute withdrawal syndromes can last days, weeks or months. Protracted withdrawal syndrome, also known as post-acute-withdrawal syndrome or "PAWS", is a low-grade continuation of some of the symptoms of acute withdrawal, typically in a remitting-relapsing pattern, often resulting in relapse and prolonged disability of a degree to preclude the possibility of lawful employment. Protracted withdrawal syndrome can last for months, years, or depending on individual factors, indefinitely. Protracted withdrawal syndrome is noted to be most often caused by benzodiazepines .  To dispel the popular misassociation with addiction, physical dependence to medications is sometimes compared to dependence on insulin by persons with diabetes.  Physical dependence can manifest itself in the appearance of both physical and psychological symptoms which are caused by physiological adaptions in the central nervous system and the brain due to chronic exposure to a substance. Symptoms which may be experienced during withdrawal or reduction in dosage include increased heart rate and/or blood pressure, sweating, and tremors.  More serious withdrawal symptoms such as confusion , seizures , and visual hallucinations indicate a serious emergency and the need for immediate medical care. Sedative hypnotic drugs such as alcohol , benzodiazepines , and barbiturates are the only commonly available substances that can be fatal in withdrawal due to their propensity to induce withdrawal convulsions. Abrupt withdrawal from other drugs, such as opioids can cause an extremely painful withdrawal that is very rarely fatal in patients of general good health and with medical treatment, but is more often fatal in patients with weakened cardiovascular systems; toxicity is generally caused by the often-extreme increases in heart rate and blood pressure , or due to arrhythmia due to electrolyte imbalance caused by the inability to eat, and constant diarrhea and vomiting  associated with acute opioid withdrawal, especially in longer-acting substances where the diarrhea and emesis can continue unabated for weeks, although life-threatening complications are extremely rare, and nearly non-existent with proper medical management. Treatment for physical dependence depends upon the drug being withdrawn and often includes administration of another drug, especially for substances that can be dangerous when abruptly discontinued or when previous attempts have failed.  Physical dependence is usually managed by a slow dose reduction over a period of weeks, months or sometimes longer depending on the drug, dose and the individual.  A physical dependence on alcohol is often managed with a cross tolerant drug, such as long acting benzodiazepines to manage the alcohol withdrawal symptoms.	3.0724864
A diuretic is a chemical substance. This substance is either in a herb , or it has been separated and made into a drug . Diuretics increase the amount of urine that is secreted from the body. Diuretics are used as a treatment for heart failure , liver cirrhosis , hypertension and certain problems with the kidneys . Diuretics are often abused by people suffering form bulimia nervosa as a way to lose weight. Well-known substances that have diuretic properties are tea , coffee and alcohol .	A diuretic  is any substance that promotes diuresis , the increased production of urine . This includes forced diuresis . There are several categories of diuretics. All diuretics increase the excretion of water from bodies, although each class does so in a distinct way. Alternatively, an antidiuretic , such as vasopressin , is an agent or drug which reduces the excretion of water in urine. In medicine , diuretics are used to treat heart failure , liver cirrhosis , hypertension , influenza , water poisoning , and certain kidney diseases . Some diuretics, such as acetazolamide , help to make the urine more alkaline and are helpful in increasing excretion of substances such as aspirin in cases of overdose or poisoning. Diuretics are sometimes abused by people with an eating disorder , especially people with bulimia nervosa , with the goal of losing weight. The antihypertensive actions of some diuretics  are independent of their diuretic effect.   That is, the reduction in blood pressure is not due to decreased blood volume resulting from increased urine production , but occurs through other mechanisms and at lower doses than that required to produce diuresis . Indapamide was specifically designed with this in mind, and has a larger therapeutic window for hypertension  than most other diuretics.	3.0724223
Abdominal obesity , also called central body obesity , is a condition involving excess fat surrounding the abdomen and an increase in waist size in humans. Obesity in this area is linked to Type 2 Diabetes ,  insulin resistance and heart disease in humans of both genders.	Abdominal obesity , also known as central obesity and truncal obesity , is a condition when excessive abdominal fat around the stomach and abdomen has built up to the extent that it is likely to have a negative impact on health. Abdominal obesity has been strongly linked to cardiovascular disease ,  Alzheimer's disease , and other metabolic and vascular diseases .  Visceral and central abdominal fat and waist circumference show a strong association with type 2 diabetes .  Visceral fat , also known as organ fat or intra-abdominal fat , is located inside the peritoneal cavity , packed in between internal organs and torso , as opposed to subcutaneous fat , which is found underneath the skin , and intramuscular fat , which is found interspersed in skeletal muscle . Visceral fat is composed of several adipose depots including mesenteric , epididymal white adipose tissue , and perirenal fat . An excess of adipose visceral fat is known as central obesity, the "pot belly" or "beer belly" effect, in which the abdomen protrudes excessively. This body type is also known as "apple shaped", as opposed to "pear shaped" in which fat is deposited on the hips and buttocks.	3.0696003
Gastric bypass surgery is a surgery in which the stomach is divided and the gastrointestinal tract is redirected. The surgery is performed on people who have morbid obesity or have type 2 diabetes , high blood pressure or other weight-related health problems. As with all surgery, problems may occur. Some people could die after having the surgery. Gastric bypass surgery can be done using methods that make only small incisions  into the abdomen . It is one of the most difficult surgeries to perform that way. Advantages of using those methods include that patients don't have to stay in the hospital as long, they have less pain, it doesn't take as long to recover, and the scars are smaller. 	Gastric bypass surgery refers to a technique in which the stomach is divided into a small upper pouch and a much larger lower "remnant" pouch and then the small intestine is rearranged to connect to both. Surgeons have developed several different ways to reconnect the intestine, thus leading to several different gastric bypass procedures . Any GBP leads to a marked reduction in the functional volume of the stomach, accompanied by an altered physiological and physical response to food. The operation is prescribed to treat morbid obesity , type 2 diabetes , hypertension , sleep apnea , and other comorbid conditions. Bariatric surgery is the term encompassing all of the surgical treatments for morbid obesity, not just gastric bypasses, which make up only one class of such operations. The resulting weight loss, typically dramatic, markedly reduces comorbidities. The long-term mortality rate of gastric bypass patients has been shown to be reduced by up to 40%.   As with all surgery, complications may occur.  A study from 2005 to 2006 revealed that 15% of patients experience complications as a result of gastric bypass, and 0.5% of patients died within six months of surgery due to complications. 	3.0686133
In medicine , family history means information on medical disorders the direct blood relatives of a patient may have had. Many healthcare professionals look at the information on family medical problems, such as autism , diabetes , mental illness , autoimmune diseases , cancer .  Many medical conditions are carried only by the female line, including X-linked conditions. Others are carried by the male line, including Y-linked conditions.	In medicine , a family history  consists of information about disorders from which the direct blood relatives of the patient have suffered.  Genealogy typically includes very little of the medical history of the family , but the medical history could be considered a specific subset of the total history of a family.  Accurate knowledge of a patient's family history may identify a predisposition to developing certain illnesses, which can inform clinical decisions and allow effective management or even prevention of conditions.   Early mentions of family medical histories in medical literature date from the 1840s. Henry Ancell mentioned inquiring about the family history of a patient in a medical case study in 1842, noting that the patient's presenting concern appears to be present in relatives and remarking on the prolific reproduction of her female relatives.  In 1849, W.H. Walshe argued in a lecture at University College Hospital that in addition to a history of the presenting disease itself, a physician should also collect family history.  Walshe's lecture does not define or justify the family history, which may suggest that taking one was already in common practice. However, later 19th-century physicians did provide a specific apologia for family histories and in some cases explicitly noted that they were not yet being taken routinely. James Begbie argued that understanding the health of the entire family, including cousins, can help predict otherwise unpredictable illnesses that run in the family.  Begbie's use of the family history for both predictive and normative evaluation of the family anticipated Francis Galton , who championed the routine family history as a eugenic strategy in his 1883 text, Inquiries into Human Faculty and Its Development . Galton writes:	3.0660007

Frontotemporal dementia  is the clinical presentation of frontotemporal lobar degeneration . It is characterized by progressive neuronal loss predominantly involving the frontal or temporal lobes , and typical loss of over 70% of spindle neurons , while other neuron types remain intact.  Second only to Alzheimer's disease  in prevalence, FTD accounts for 20% of young-onset dementia cases.  Common signs and symptoms include significant changes in social and personal behavior, apathy, blunting of emotions, and deficits in both expressive and receptive language.	Frontotemporal dementia , or frontotemporal degeneration disease ,  or frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder ,  encompasses several types of dementia involving the frontal and temporal lobes .  FTDs are broadly presented as behavioral or language disorders.  The three main subtypes or variant syndromes are a behavioral variant  previously known as Pick's disease ,   and two variants of primary progressive aphasia – semantic variant , and nonfluent variant .   Two rare distinct subtypes of FTD are neuronal intermediate filament inclusion disease , and basophilic inclusion body disease.  Other related disorders include corticobasal syndrome and FTD  with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis  FTD-ALS also called FTD- MND .  Frontotemporal dementias are mostly early-onset syndromes that are linked to frontotemporal lobar degeneration ,  which is characterized by progressive neuronal loss predominantly involving the frontal or temporal lobes , and a typical loss of over 70% of spindle neurons , while other neuron types remain intact.  FTD was first described by Arnold Pick in 1892 and was originally called Pick's disease , a term now reserved only for behavioral variant FTD which shows the presence of Pick bodies and Pick cells.    Second only to Alzheimer's disease  in prevalence , FTD accounts for 20% of early-onset dementia cases.  Signs and symptoms typically manifest in late adulthood, more commonly between the ages of 45 and 65, approximately equally affecting men and women. 	3.0625207
A toothache is a pain felt in a person's tooth , normally when the tooth is hurt. A tooth can be hurt by tooth decay caused by plaque or by an injury .	Toothache , also known as dental pain ,  is pain in the teeth or their supporting structures, caused by dental diseases or pain referred to the teeth by non-dental diseases. When severe it may impact sleep, eating, and other daily activities. Common causes include inflammation of the pulp , , dentin hypersensitivity , apical periodontitis , dental abscesses , alveolar osteitis , acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis , and temporomandibular disorder . 	3.0519512
The therapeutic index is a number that tells how safe it is to use a drug. It is obtained by dividing two numbers: the dose needed so that half of all individuals show the desired effect, and the dose which will kill half of all the individuals.	The therapeutic index  is a quantitative measurement of the relative safety of a drug.  It is a comparison of the amount of a therapeutic agent that causes the therapeutic effect to the amount that causes toxicity.  The related terms therapeutic window or safety window refer to a range of doses which optimize between efficacy and toxicity, achieving the greatest therapeutic benefit without resulting in unacceptable side-effects or toxicity. Classically, in an established clinical indication setting of an approved drug, TI refers to the ratio of the dose of drug that causes adverse effects at an incidence/severity not compatible with the targeted indication  to the dose that leads to the desired pharmacological effect . In contrast, in a drug development setting TI is calculated based on plasma exposure levels.  In the early days of pharmaceutical toxicology, TI was frequently determined in animals as lethal dose of a drug for 50% of the population  divided by the minimum effective dose for 50% of the population . Today, more sophisticated toxicity endpoints are used.	3.0456827
Erythema ab igne is a rash of the skin , which is usually caused by the long-term exposure to heat or infrared radiation ,  and which is not a burn . Usually the name is abbreviated EAI . Other names include hot water bottle rash  fire stains ,  laptop thigh , granny's tartan and toasted skin syndrome .  Some people may complain of mild itchiness and a burning sensation. When a change in skin pigmentation can not be seen, it is often not noticed at all.	Erythema ab igne  , also known as hot water bottle rash ,  is a skin condition caused by long-term exposure to heat .  Prolonged thermal radiation exposure to the skin can lead to the development of reticulated erythema , hyperpigmentation, scaling and telangiectasias in the affected area. Some people may complain of mild itchiness and a burning sensation, but often, unless a change in pigmentation is seen, it can go unnoticed. Different types of heat sources can cause this condition such as: The pathogenesis of erythema ab igne remains unknown. It has been proposed that thermal radiation exposure can induce damage to superficial blood vessels that subsequently leads to epidermal vascular dilation. The dilation of vessels presents morphologically as the initially observed erythema.  Red blood cell extravasion and deposition of hemosiderin that follows clinically appears as hyperpigmentation, which can occur in a reticular distribution. It has also been proposed that the distribution of affected blood vessels — predominantly in the superficial subcutaneous plexus — results in the net-like pattern of erythema ab igne skin lesions.	3.0452816
A stay-at-home order  or a movement control order  is an order from a government to lower/end movements of a population as a mass quarantine move for stopping an epidemic , or pandemic . This is done by ordering residents to stay home except for essential tasks or to work in essential businesses. In many cases, outdoor activities are allowed. Nonessential businesses are either closed or made to working from home.  In some regions, it has added a curfew  or called a shelter-in-place order ,  but it is not to be confused with a shelter in place situation.  Similar measures have been used around the world, but the term lockdown is used instead.  	A stay-at-home order , safer-at-home order , movement control order , or lockdown restrictions  – also referred to by loose use of the terms  quarantine ,  isolation , or lockdown – is an order from a government authority that restricts movements of a population as a mass quarantine strategy for suppressing or mitigating an epidemic or pandemic by ordering residents to stay home except for essential tasks or for work in essential businesses. The medical distinction between such an order and a quarantine is that a quarantine is usually understood to involve isolating only selected people who are considered to be possibly infectious rather than the entire population of an area  In many cases, outdoor activities are allowed. Non-essential businesses are either closed or adapted to working from home .  In some regions, it has been implemented as a round-the-clock curfew  or called a shelter-in-place order ,  but it is not to be confused with a shelter-in-place situation.  Similar measures have been used around the world, and, both officially and colloquially, different names have been used to refer to them, often only very loosely linked to the term's actual medical meaning. Examples include confinement ,  isolation ,  quarantine , lockdown or ‘strict social distancing measures’.  Stay-at-home orders have colloquially  been referred to as quarantine or lockdown - but some officials have a concern that the word lockdown may send a wrong message for people to incorrectly think that it includes door-to-door searching for infected people to be forced into quarantines similar to the Hubei lockdown .  The term lockdown was used by the media and the World Health Organization  to describe the action taken in January 2020 by the government of China to restrict movements of people in order to control the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019  in Wuhan .   When Italian authorities imposed a strict quarantine order in the northern part of the country, the media also used the term lockdown, which was used for Spain and France , as well as other countries around the world.     Although it is not a technical term in public health or laws, the media continued to use lockdown to describe the actions taken by these governments.  As the lockdowns were expanded to other countries, there was a shift in the definitions. Measures are less restrictive and other terms emerged in attempts to differentiate from the most restrictive measure in China.  When the authorities in San Francisco Bay Area in the United States issued an order in March 2020 for residents to stay home to control the outbreak of COVID-19, they called it a shelter-in-place order .  People were not familiar with it as the term shelter in place had been used in other emergency situations such as an active shooter which would require seeking a safe place to hide within the same building that the person already occupies until the situation is resolved.  This caused confusion to the residents under the order on what exactly they are supposed to do. 	3.0442214

Medical Tourism is when patients visit other countries for medical care. The patients usually come from developed countries to find treatment at lower prices. Over 50 countries have identified medical tourism as a national industry.  Examples of common medical procedures done for medical tourists are surgeries like joint replacement, heart surgery, cosmetic surgery , dental treatment , and addictions rehabilitation .  The term medical tourism can also be called medical travel, health tourism or global healthcare. it was initially developed by travel agencies and the mass media to describe the rapidly-growing practice of travelling across international borders to obtain health care.mainly it is for curing people and a lot of countries believe on this. Countries that are popular for Medical Tourism are:	Medical tourism refers to people traveling abroad to obtain medical treatment. In the past, this usually referred to those who traveled from less-developed countries to major medical centers in highly developed countries for treatment unavailable at home.   However, in recent years it may equally refer to those from developed countries who travel to developing countries for lower-priced medical treatments. The motivation may be also for medical services unavailable or non-licensed in the home country: There are differences between the medical agencies  world-wide, whether a drug is approved in their country or not. Even within Europe, although therapy protocols might be approved by the European Medical Agency , several countries have their own review organizations in order to evaluate whether the same therapy protocol would be "cost-effective", so that patients face differences in the therapy protocols, particularly in the access of these drugs, which might be partially explained by the financial strength of the particular Health System. Medical tourism most often is for surgeries  or similar treatments, though people also travel for dental tourism or fertility tourism .  People with rare conditions may travel to countries where the treatment is better understood. However, almost all types of health care are available, including psychiatry , alternative medicine, convalescent care, and even burial services. Health tourism is a wider term for travel that focuses on medical treatments and the use of healthcare services. It covers a wide field of health-oriented tourism ranging from preventive and health-conductive treatment to rehabilitational and curative forms of travel. Wellness tourism is a related field.	3.0363243
The First Geneva Convention is one of several Geneva Conventions . It is more formally known as the Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded in Armies in the Field, 1864 . It covers the treatment of battlefield injuries and was made in 1864 as part of the making of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement .	The First Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded in Armies in the Field, held on 22 August 1864, is the first of four treaties of the Geneva Conventions . It defines "the basis on which rest the rules of international law for the protection of the victims of armed conflicts."  After the first treaty was adopted in 1864, it was significantly revised and replaced in 1906, 1929, and finally 1949. It is inextricably linked to the International Committee of the Red Cross , which is both the instigator for the inception and enforcer of the articles in these conventions. The 1864 Geneva Convention was instituted at a critical period in European political and military history. Elsewhere, the American Civil War had been raging since 1861, and would ultimately claim between 750,000 and 900,000 lives. Between the fall of Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 and the rise of his nephew in the Italian campaign of 1859 , the powers had maintained peace in western Europe.  Yet, with the 1853–1856 conflict in the Crimea , war had returned to Europe, and while those troubles were "in a distant and inaccessible region" northern Italy was "so accessible from all parts of western Europe that it instantly filled with curious observers;" while the bloodshed was not excessive the sight of it was unfamiliar and shocking.  Despite its intent of ameliorating the ravages of war, the inception of the 1864 Geneva Convention inaugurated "a renewal of military activity on a large scale, to which the people of western Europe…had not been accustomed since the first Napoleon had been eliminated."  The movement for an international set of laws governing the treatment and care for the wounded and prisoners of war began when relief activist Henry Dunant witnessed the Battle of Solferino in 1859, fought between French- Piedmontese and Austrian armies in Northern Italy.  The subsequent suffering of 40,000 wounded soldiers left on the field due to lack of facilities, personnel, and truces to give them medical aid moved Dunant into action. Upon return to Geneva , Dunant published his account Un Souvenir de Solferino .  He urged the calling together of an international conference and soon co-founded the International Committee of the Red Cross in 1863. 	3.03547
Diazepam is a benzodiazepine which has a relatively long half-life . It is mostly used to treat anxiety , certain  forms of epilepsy , muscle spasms , and sleeping problems . Like with other benzodiazepines, there is a risk of addiction if used for long periods of this. For this reason the drug is used to treat acute cases  to avoid dependence. According to the World Health Organization diazepam is an essential drug . Diazepam is marketed under a number of names; its original trade name was Valium . It has been the most prescribed medicine in the United States many times. It is sometimes used recreationally to cause a calming effect.	Diazepam , first marketed as Valium , is a medicine of the benzodiazepine family that acts as an anxiolytic .  It is commonly used to treat a range of conditions, including anxiety , seizures , alcohol withdrawal syndrome , benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome , muscle spasms , insomnia , and restless legs syndrome .  It may also be used to cause memory loss during certain medical procedures.   It can be taken by mouth , inserted into the rectum , injected into muscle , injected into a vein or used as a nasal spray .   When given into a vein, effects begin in one to five minutes and last up to an hour.  By mouth, effects begin after 15 to 60 minutes.  Common side effects include sleepiness and trouble with coordination.   Serious side effects are rare.  They include suicide , decreased breathing, and an increased risk of seizures if used too frequently in those with epilepsy .    Occasionally, excitement or agitation may occur.   Long term use can result in tolerance , dependence , and withdrawal symptoms on dose reduction.  Abrupt stopping after long-term use can be potentially dangerous.  After stopping, cognitive problems may persist for six months or longer.  It is not recommended during pregnancy or breastfeeding.  Its mechanism of action is by increasing the effect of the neurotransmitter gamma -aminobutyric acid . 	3.0341146
Pain disorder is a condition where a patient experiences chronic pain in different places in the body; this pain seems to be caused by psychological stress . Treatment of the condition can be done with either therapy or drugs .	Pain disorder is chronic pain experienced by a patient in one or more areas, and is thought to be caused by psychological stress . The pain is often so severe that it disables the patient from proper functioning. Duration may be as short as a few days or as long as many years. The disorder may begin at any age, and occurs more frequently in girls than boys.  This disorder often occurs after an accident, during an illness that has caused pain, or after withdrawing from use during drug addiction, which then takes on a 'life' of its own.  Common symptoms of pain disorder are: negative or distorted cognition, such as feelings of despair or hopelessness; inactivity and passivity, in some cases disability; increased pain, sometimes requiring clinical treatment; sleep disturbance and fatigue; disruption of social relationships; depression and anxiety.  Acute conditions last less than six months while chronic pain disorder lasts six or more months.  There is no neurological or physiological basis for the pain. Pain is reported as more distressing than it should be had there been a physical explanation. Pain behavior highlights the psychological aspect of pain disorder. This can be demonstrated how moderate pain symptoms become more painful when rewarded in the form of solicitous and attentive behavior of others, by monetary gain, or by the successful avoidance of distasteful activities.  The same can be said about excessive worry. A minor physical symptom can be aggravated or become more harmful and threatening if the person suffering engages in a constant body and symptom appraisal, which can lead to stress and maladaptive behavior when coping with the physical symptom. 	3.0329897
The choking game is a challenge that aims to cause unconsciousness by lowering the supply of oxygen to the brain . When becoming conscious again , people often have a euphoric feeling , or a good dream. Most of the time, adolescents try this game. One of the reasons is that they want to experiment with other states of consciousness. If they do it as a group, peer pressure often plays a role. The practice seems to have started in France, in the early 20th century. After the second world war , several authors described it. The reasons to play this game are different from those of erotic asphyxiation . Steve Field, chairman of the Royal College of General Practitioners in London,  claims that children and teens try the game mainly "to get a high without taking drugs." Children "aren't playing this game for sexual gratification."  It is frequently confused with erotic asphyxiation, which is oxygen deprivation for sexual arousal .  Unlike erotic asphyxiation, adults usually don't play this game.   The brain will take permanent damage, if it doesn't get enough oxygen.  The first effects occur within minutes. In the United States , and in France , where it is known as "jeu de foulard", this practice has caused several deaths. The CDC has identified 82 victims aged between 6 and 19 years, who died as a result of this practice, between 1995 and 2007.  Most of the sensations felt are:	The Choking game refers to intentionally cutting off oxygen to the brain with the goal of inducing temporary loss of consciousness and euphoria . Limited research has been conducted regarding motivations for practicing the fainting game, although thrill-seeking has been identified as a risk factor,  as has the perception that it is a low-risk activity.  Anecdotal reasons stated include: Reasons for practice are distinct from erotic asphyxiation . Steve Field, chairman of the Royal College of General Practitioners in London,  claims that the fainting game is pursued primarily by children and teens "to get a high without taking drugs." Children "aren't playing this game for sexual gratification." It is frequently confused with erotic asphyxiation, which is oxygen deprivation for sexual arousal. Unlike erotic asphyxiation , practice of the fainting game appears to be uncommon in adulthood. 	3.0307117
A fasciculation , or "muscle twitch", is a small, local, involuntary muscle contraction and relaxation . At times it may be visible under the skin. Deeper areas can be detected by EMG testing. A fasciculation can happen in any skeletal muscle in the body . Fasciculations can occur in normal healthy people.  One uncommon reason for them is due to a lower motor neuron lesion that may be caused by any of several diseases . One example would be Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis .	A fasciculation , or muscle twitch , is a spontaneous, involuntary muscle contraction and relaxation, involving fine muscle fibers.  They are common, with as much as 70% of people experiencing them.  They can be benign, or associated with more serious conditions.  When no cause or pathology is identified, they are diagnosed as benign fasciculation syndrome .  The most effective way to detect fasciculations may be surface electromyography . Surface EMG is more sensitive than needle electromyography and clinical observation in the detection of fasciculation in people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis .  Deeper areas of contraction can be detected by electromyography  testing, though they can happen in any skeletal muscle in the body. Fasciculations arise as a result of spontaneous depolarization of a lower motor neuron leading to the synchronous contraction of all the skeletal muscle fibers within a single motor unit. An example of normal spontaneous depolarization is the constant contractions of cardiac muscle , causing the heart to beat. Usually, intentional movement of the involved muscle causes fasciculations to cease immediately, but they may return once the muscle is at rest again.	3.0282667
Stevens–Johnson syndrome is a disease of the skin . In most cases, it is caused by an allergic reaction to drugs . This accounts for about half the cases. Lymphoma , and other infections are responsible for most other cases. The disease is characterized by cell death that causes the epidermis to separate from the dermis . Since this is similar to what happens in burn, some of the same methods are used to treat patients.	Stevens–Johnson syndrome  is a type of severe skin reaction .  Together with toxic epidermal necrolysis  and Stevens–Johnson/toxic epidermal necrolysis , it forms a spectrum of disease , with SJS being less severe.   Erythema multiforme  is generally considered a separate condition.  Early symptoms of SJS include fever and flu-like symptoms .  A few days later, the skin begins to blister and peel, forming painful raw areas.  Mucous membranes , such as the mouth, are also typically involved.  Complications include dehydration , sepsis , pneumonia and multiple organ failure .  The most common cause is certain medications such as lamotrigine , carbamazepine , allopurinol , sulfonamide antibiotics and nevirapine .  Other causes can include infections such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae and cytomegalovirus , or the cause may remain unknown.   Risk factors include HIV/AIDS and systemic lupus erythematosus . 	3.0215197

Informed consent is the right of a citizen who will undergo medical treatment or care to know about the kind of treatment or service that will be provided by the doctor as well as the procedures involved. It also includes the right to refuse any treatment or care without prior approval. Informed consent is part of the medical ethics to avoid medical abuse or accidents. It has been admitted as one of the human rights in some international agreements, and also in the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities .	Informed consent is a process for getting permission before conducting a healthcare intervention on a person, for conducting some form of research on a person, or for disclosing a person's information. A health care provider may ask a patient to consent to receive therapy before providing it, a clinical researcher may ask a research participant before enrolling that person into a clinical trial , and a researcher may ask a research participant before starting some form of controlled experiment . Informed consent is collected according to guidelines from the fields of medical ethics and research ethics . Free consent is a cognate term enshrined in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights . The Covenant was adopted in 1966 by the United Nations , and supposed to be in force by 23 March 1976. Article seven prohibits experiments conducted without the "free consent to medical or scientific experimentation" of the subject.  As of September 2019  , the Covenant has 173 parties and six more signatories without ratification.  An informed consent can be said to have been given based upon a clear appreciation and understanding of the facts, implications, and consequences of an action. To give informed consent, the individual concerned must have adequate reasoning faculties and be in possession of all relevant facts. Impairments to reasoning and judgment that may prevent informed consent include basic intellectual or emotional immaturity, high levels of stress such as posttraumatic stress disorder  or a severe intellectual disability , severe mental disorder , intoxication , severe sleep deprivation , Alzheimer's disease , or being in a coma .	3.0188115
A morgue is a place where dead human bodies are kept for a short time soon after the person died. Sometimes, the body is examined by autopsy . Most often, the body is delivered to a mortuary and buried in a grave or cremated . Morgues are found in hospitals , usually on the lowest floor or basement.	A morgue or mortuary  is a place used for the storage of human corpses awaiting identification or removal for autopsy or respectful burial , cremation or other method. In modern times, corpses have customarily been refrigerated to delay decomposition .  The term mortuary dates from the early 14th century, from Anglo-French mortuarie , meaning "gift to a parish priest from a deceased parishioner," from Medieval Latin mortuarium, noun use of neuter of Late Latin adjective mortuarius "pertaining to the dead," from Latin mortuus , pp. of mori "to die" ). The meaning of "place where bodies are kept temporarily" was first recorded in 1865, as a euphemism for the earlier English term "deadhouse." The term morgue comes from the French morgue , which means 'to look at solemnly, to defy'. First used to describe the inner wicket of a prison , where new prisoners were kept so that jailers and turnkeys could recognize them in the future, it took on its modern meaning in fifteenth-century Paris , being used to describe part of the Châtelet used for the storage and identification of unknown corpses.	3.0165987
Hydrochloric acid is a chemical compound . It is a solution of hydrogen chloride  gas that is dissolved in water . In the past, people called it muriatic acid . It is widely used in industry, and it is also made by the stomach to help digest food. Hydrochloric acid, like all acids , react with bases to produce salts . In high concentrations , hydrochloric acid can make acidic mists. Both the mist and the solution hurt human tissue. They are caustic , and can cause chemical burns . These can damage the eyes , the skin , the respiratory system , and other organs of the human body . When hydrochloric acid is mixed with certain chemicals such as bleach , the toxic gas chlorine is made. When working with hydrochloric acid, certain safety measures should be taken. These include using rubber or PVC gloves , wearing goggles to protect the eyes, as well as special clothing that is resistant to chemicals. Hydrochloric acid reacts with some metals, corroding them and making flammable hydrogen gas.	Hydrochloric acid , also known as muriatic acid , is an aqueous solution of hydrogen chloride .  It is a colorless solution with a distinctive pungent smell. It is classified as a strong acid . It is a component of the gastric acid in the digestive systems of most animal species, including humans. Hydrochloric acid is an important laboratory reagent and industrial chemical.   In the early tenth century, the Persian physician and alchemist Abu Bakr al-Razi  conducted experiments with sal ammoniac  and vitriol , which he distilled together, thus producing the gas hydrogen chloride. In doing so, al-Razi came very close to discovering hydrochloric acid, but it appears that he disregarded the gaseous products of his experiments, concentrating instead on the color changes that could be effected in the residue.  Drawing on al-Razi's experiments, the De aluminibus et salibus  described the heating of metals with various salts, which in the case of mercury resulted in the production of mercury chloride .  In this process, hydrochloric acid actually started to form, but it immediately reacted with the mercury to produce corrosive sublimate. Thirteenth-century Latin alchemists, for whom the De aluminibus et salibus was one of the main reference works, were fascinated by the chlorinating properties of corrosive sublimate, and they soon discovered that when the metals are eliminated from the process of heating vitriols, alums , and salts, strong mineral acids can directly be distilled.  One important invention that resulted from the discovery of the mineral acids is aqua regia , a mixture of nitric acid and hydrochloric acid in a 1:3 proportion, capable of dissolving gold. This was first described in pseudo-Geber 's De inventione veritatis , where aqua regia was prepared by adding ammonium chloride to nitric acid.  However, the production of hydrochloric acid itself  depended on the use of more efficient cooling apparatus, which would only develop in subsequent centuries.  Thus, recipes for the production of hydrochloric acid only appear in the late sixteenth century, the earliest being found in Giovanni Battista Della Porta 's  Magiae naturalis  and in the works of other contemporary chemists like Andreas Libavius , Jean Beguin , and Oswald Croll .  The knowledge of mineral acids such as hydrochloric acid would be of key importance to seventeenth-century chemists like Daniel Sennert  and Robert Boyle , who used their capability to rapidly dissolve metals in their demonstrations of the composite nature of bodies.  Because it was produced from rock salt according to the methods of Johann Rudolph Glauber , hydrochloric acid was historically called by European alchemists spirits of salt or acidum salis . Both names are still used, especially in other languages, such as German : Salzsäure , Dutch : Zoutzuur , Swedish : Saltsyra , Spanish : Salfumán , Turkish : Tuz Ruhu , Polish : kwas solny and Czech : kyselina solná	3.0145924
Blunt trauma is a kind of trauma that usually results from being hit by something dull and firm .  It is also called blunt force trauma . This is different from penetrating trauma where an object, such as a bullet enters the body. Common types of blunt force trauma include:  If blunt force trauma is not too severe, it may cause only cuts , bruises , and scrapes .  However, bad blunt force trauma can cause many serious problems, like: 	Blunt trauma , also known as blunt force trauma or non-penetrating trauma , is physical trauma or impactful force to a body part, often occurring with road traffic collisions , direct blows, assaults , injuries during sports , and particularly in the elderly who fall .   It is contrasted with penetrating trauma which occurs when an object pierces the skin and enters a tissue of the body, creating an open wound and bruise .  Blunt trauma can result in contusions , abrasions , lacerations , internal hemorrhages , and bone fractures .  Worldwide, a significant cause of disability and death in people under the age of 35 years is trauma, of which most are due to blunt trauma. 	3.0131938
Dentistry is a specialty in medicine , which is practiced by a dentist. Dentists find out what's wrong, fix, and help prevent problems with teeth . A dentist has other people that help him with their job. Dental hygienists help people keep their teeth clean. A dental assistant helps the dentist when they are treating a patient. Dental surgeons will perform surgery to fix large or dangerous problems with people's teeth. There are also dentists called orthodontists , who can move people's teeth using braces . Dental surgeons and orthodontists are called specialists. 	Dentistry , also known as dental medicine and oral medicine , is a branch of medicine that consists of the study, diagnosis , prevention, and treatment of diseases , disorders, and conditions of the oral cavity , commonly in the dentition but also the oral mucosa , and of adjacent and related structures and tissues, particularly in the maxillofacial  area.  Although primarily associated with teeth among the general public, the field of dentistry or dental medicine is not limited to teeth but includes other aspects of the craniofacial complex including the temporomandibular joint and other supporting, muscular, lymphatic, nervous, vascular, and anatomical structures. Dentistry is often also understood to subsume the now largely defunct medical specialty of stomatology  for which reason the two terms are used interchangeably in certain regions. 	3.0130284
Acral necrosis is a common symptom of the Black Death that causes skin to discolour black and can cause the area nearby to bleed . This is most common at the end of limbs 	Acral necrosis is a symptom common in bubonic plague .  The striking black discoloration of skin and tissue, primarily on the extremities , is commonly thought to have given rise to the name " Black Death ," associated both with the disease and the pandemic which occurred in the 14th century. The term in fact came from the figural sense of "black", that is ghastly, lugubrious or dreadful.   Clotting and bleeding beneath the skin cause an area of haemorrhage, the presence of red blood cells lying outside of capillaries, into the skin and subcutaneous tissue.  In isolation, this is called an ecchymosis or bruise and may be the result of injury or illness.  However, acral necrosis occurs when blood supply is disrupted for prolonged periods, blackening and damaging the affected area and surrounding tissue.  With appropriate medical treatment, areas with acral necrosis may be successfully restored to function and lead a normal life.  Untreated cases can lead to death. 	3.0005257
Medicine is the science that deals with diseases  in humans and animals , the best ways to prevent diseases, and the best ways to return to a healthy condition.  People who practice medicine are most often called medical doctors or physicians. Often doctors work closely with nurses and many other types of health care professionals. Many doctors specialize in one kind of medical work. For example, pediatrics is the medical specialty about the health of children .   In this specialty, the doctor is trained to provide anaesthesia and sedation.  This is important for surgeries and certain medical procedures. Anaesthesiologists also provide pre-operative assessments, ensuring the patient is safe during the operation and successfully awakens from anaesthesia after the operation. They assess for medical conditions and suitability for anaesthesia. They screen for risk factors prior to surgery and try to optimize the operative environment for the patient and the surgeon. They are the doctors who give epidurals during labor and delivery, provide spinal blocks, local nerve blocks, and general anaesthesia for procedures. They are the doctors who are especially trained in intubation . Hence, due to their skill in intubation, they are often the first line responders for emergencies. They help people who are in distress with their breathing, who have lost their airway or when their airway has become obstructed. A cardiologist is a doctor with special training on the heart.     The doctor in this field ensures the heart is healthy and functions properly. The heart is a vital organ whose role is to pump blood to the rest of the body. The purpose of blood is to deliver oxygen to the tissues. Without the heart functioning well, our tissues and organs would die and not function properly. Cardiologists treat heart attacks, sudden cardiac arrests, arrhythmias , heart failure  and many other heart related illnesses. They specialize in life saving procedures like cardiac stents and cardiac ablation. There is a subspecialty within cardiology called "Interventional cardiology." These are cardiologists who specialize in interventions or procedures to save the function of the heart, such as cardiac stenting or angiography .	Medicine is the science  and practice  of caring for a patient and managing the diagnosis , prognosis , prevention , treatment or palliation of their injury or disease . Medicine encompasses a variety of health care practices evolved to maintain and restore health by the prevention and treatment of illness . Contemporary medicine applies biomedical sciences , biomedical research , genetics , and medical technology to diagnose , treat, and prevent injury and disease, typically through pharmaceuticals or surgery , but also through therapies as diverse as psychotherapy , external splints and traction , medical devices , biologics , and ionizing radiation , amongst others.  Medicine has been practiced since prehistoric times , during most of which it was an art  frequently having connections to the religious and philosophical beliefs of local culture. For example, a medicine man would apply herbs and say prayers for healing, or an ancient philosopher and physician would apply bloodletting according to the theories of humorism . In recent centuries, since the advent of modern science , most medicine has become a combination of art and science . While stitching technique for sutures is an art learned through practice, the knowledge of what happens at the cellular and molecular level in the tissues being stitched arises through science.	2.9891937

Septic shock is a medical condition which can result from sepsis . Sepsis is a special form of infection . With septic shock, the circulation of blood changes or stops. This makes septic shock a medical emergency ,which is usually treated in intensive care . Between a quarter and half the people with the condition die. Treatment is usually done in the following steps:	Septic shock is a potentially fatal medical condition that occurs when sepsis , which is organ injury or damage in response to infection , leads to dangerously low blood pressure and abnormalities in cellular metabolism. The Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock  defines septic shock as a subset of sepsis in which particularly profound circulatory, cellular, and metabolic abnormalities are associated with a greater risk of mortality than with sepsis alone. Patients with septic shock can be clinically identified by requiring  a vasopressor to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 65 mm Hg or greater and having serum lactate level greater than 2 mmol/L  in the absence of hypovolemia . This combination is associated with hospital mortality rates greater than 40%.  The primary infection is most commonly caused by bacteria , but also may be by fungi , viruses or parasites . It may be located in any part of the body, but most commonly in the lungs, brain, urinary tract , skin or abdominal organs .  It can cause multiple organ dysfunction syndrome  and death .  Frequently, people with septic shock are cared for in intensive care units . It most commonly affects children, immunocompromised individuals, and the elderly, as their immune systems cannot deal with infection as effectively as those of healthy adults. The mortality rate from septic shock is approximately 25–50%. 	2.9845257
Interventional radiology is defined as the branch of medicine that diagnoses and treats a wide range of diseases using actions that are performed through the skin  or carried out with the least damage by x-rays , sonography , and so on. Some of these procedures are done only for diagnostic purposes, while others are done for treatment purposes. Images are used to direct these procedures, which are usually done with needles or other tiny instruments like small tubes called catheters. The images provide road maps that allow the Interventional Radiologist to guide these instruments through the body to the areas containing diseases.	Interventional radiology  is a medical subspecialty that performs various minimally-invasive procedures using medical imaging guidance, such as x-ray fluoroscopy , computed tomography , magnetic resonance imaging , or ultrasound . IR performs both diagnostic and therapeutic procedures through very small incisions or body orifices . Diagnostic IR procedures are those intended to help make a diagnosis or guide further medical treatment, and include image-guided biopsy of a tumor or injection of an imaging contrast agent into a hollow structure, such as a blood vessel or a duct . By contrast, therapeutic IR procedures provide direct treatment—they include catheter-based medicine delivery, medical device placement , and angioplasty of narrowed structures. The main benefits of interventional radiology techniques are that they can reach the deep structures of the body through a body orifice or tiny incision using small needles and wires . That decreases risks, pain, and recovery compared to open procedures . Real-time visualization also allows precision guidance to the abnormality, making the procedure or diagnosis more accurate.   These benefits are weighed against the additional risks of lack of immediate access to internal structures , and the risks of radiation exposure such as cataracts and cancer. Interventional radiology is a set of techniques that allows access to the internal structures of the body through body orifices or very small incisions and guidance with medical imaging .  Regardless of the reason for the intervention, the procedure will likely use common elements such as a puncture needle , guidewires , a sheath , and catheters . 	2.981053
Pallor  is when the skin is a pale color.  It can be caused by illness , stress or even shock. Pallor is seen most easily on the face and palms . It can develop suddenly or slowly. Causes of pallor may include migraines , headache , hypoglycemia , anemia or scarlet fever .	Pallor is a pale color of the skin that can be caused by illness, emotional shock or stress, stimulant use, or anemia , and is the result of a reduced amount of oxyhaemoglobin and may also be visible as pallor of the conjunctivae of the eyes on physical examination. Pallor is more evident on the face and palms . It can develop suddenly or gradually, depending on the cause. It is not usually clinically significant unless it is accompanied by a general pallor . It is distinguished from similar presentations such as hypopigmentation  or simply a fair complexion. This medical sign article is a stub . You can help Wikipedia by expanding it .	2.9797676
First aid kits are used to perform first aid on injured people. A first aid kit often contains the following items:	A first aid kit is a collection of supplies and equipment that is used to give medical treatment. There is a wide variation in the contents of first aid kits based on the knowledge and experience of those putting it together, the differing first aid requirements of the area where it may be used and variations in legislation or regulation in a given area. The international standard for first aid kits is that they should be identified with the ISO graphical symbol for first aid  which is an equal white cross on a green background.  First aid kits can be assembled in almost any type of container, and this will depend on whether they are commercially produced or assembled by an individual.  Standard kits often come in durable plastic boxes, fabric pouches or in wall mounted cabinets.  The type of container will vary depending on the purpose, and they range in size from wallet-sized through to a large box.	2.979202
Prenatal testing or Prenatal diagnosis are tests done on pregnant women. They are used to test fetuses for birth defects and some genetic disorders . Prenatal tests can be non-invasive or invasive.  Non-invasive tests include things like utrasounds . In invasive tests, a needle is inserted - for example, to get a sample of fluid from the placenta ). Prenatal tests can check for many conditions, like: In some cases, the tests are administered to determine if the parents want to abort the fetus.	Prenatal testing consists of prenatal screening and prenatal diagnosis , which are aspects of prenatal care that focus on detecting problems with the pregnancy as early as possible.  These may be anatomic and physiologic problems with the health of the zygote , embryo , or fetus , either before gestation even starts  or as early in gestation as practicable. Screening can detect problems such as neural tube defects , chromosome abnormalities, and gene mutations that would lead to genetic disorders and birth defects , such as spina bifida , cleft palate , Downs Syndrome , Tay–Sachs disease , sickle cell anemia , thalassemia , cystic fibrosis , muscular dystrophy , and fragile X syndrome . Some tests are designed to discover problems which primarily affect the health of the mother, such as PAPP-A to detect pre-eclampsia or glucose tolerance tests to diagnose gestational diabetes . Screening can also detect anatomical defects such as hydrocephalus , anencephaly , heart defects , and amniotic band syndrome . Prenatal screening focuses on finding problems among a large population with affordable and noninvasive methods. Prenatal diagnosis focuses on pursuing additional detailed information once a particular problem has been found, and can sometimes be more invasive. The most common screening procedures are routine ultrasounds , blood tests, and blood pressure measurement. Common diagnosis procedures include amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling . In some cases, the tests are administered to determine if the foetus will be aborted , though physicians and patients also find it useful to diagnose high-risk pregnancies early so that delivery can be scheduled in a tertiary care hospital where the baby can receive appropriate care. There are three purposes of prenatal diagnosis:  to enable timely medical or surgical treatment of a condition before or after birth,  to give the parents the chance to abort a fetus with the diagnosed condition, and  to give parents the chance to prepare psychologically, socially, financially, and medically for a baby with a health problem or disability, or for the likelihood of a stillbirth. Prior information about problems in pregnancy means that healthcare staff as well as parents can better prepare themselves for the delivery of a child with a health problem. For example, Down Syndrome is associated with cardiac defects that may need intervention immediately upon birth. 	2.9782846
Breast reduction is a plastic surgery to make human breasts smaller. The doctor takes out fat , skin , and glands . It is done on women most of the time, but men can also get it. In 2005 , more than 113,000 women had breast reductions.   Aside from aesthetic reasons, many women choose to undergo breast reduction surgery to help reduce back strain, skin irritation, or breathing problems caused by large breasts.	Reduction mammoplasty  is the plastic surgery procedure for reducing the size of large breasts. In a breast reduction surgery for re-establishing a functional bust that is proportionate to the woman's body, the critical corrective consideration is the tissue viability of the nipple–areola complex , to ensure the functional sensitivity and lactational capability of the breasts. The indications for breast reduction surgery are three-fold – physical, aesthetic , and psychological – the restoration of the bust, of the woman's self-image , and of her mental health .  In corrective practice, the surgical techniques and praxis for reduction mammoplasty also are applied to mastopexy .   The woman afflicted with macromastia presents heavy, enlarged breasts that sag and cause her chronic pains to the head, neck, shoulders, and back; an oversized bust also causes her secondary health problems, such as poor blood circulation , impaired breathing ; chafing of the skin of the chest and the lower breast ; brassière-strap indentations to the shoulders; and the improper fit of clothes.	2.9739103
Analytical psychology is the school of psychology that came from the ideas of Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung . Analytical psychology has two main parts:	Analytical psychology  is a term coined by Carl Jung , a Swiss psychiatrist , to describe research into his new "empirical science" of the psyche. It was designed to distinguish it from Freud's psychoanalytic theories as their seven-year collaboration on psychoanalysis was drawing to an end between 1912 and 1913.    The evolution of his science is contained in his monumental opus , the Collected Works , written over sixty years of his lifetime.  The history of analytical psychology is intimately linked with the biography of Jung. At the start, it was known as the "Zurich school", whose chief figures were Eugen Bleuler , Franz Riklin , Alphonse Maeder and Jung, all centred in the Burghölzli hospital in Zurich. It was initially a theory concerning psychological complexes until Jung, upon breaking with Sigmund Freud , turned it into a generalised method of investigating archetypes and the unconscious , as well as into a specialised psychotherapy . Analytical psychology, or "complex psychology", from the German : Komplexe Psychologie , is the foundation of many developments in the study and practice of Psychology as of other disciplines. The followers of Jung are many, and some of them are members of national societies in diverse countries around the world. They collaborate professionally on an international level through the International Association of Analytical Psychologists  and the International Association for Jungian Studies . Jung's propositions have given rise to a rich and multidisciplinary literature in numerous languages.	2.9713428
Adrenomyeloneuropathy is an inherited disorder .  It does not happen very often.  It is rare .  It is a form of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy . Leukodystrophy causes a disruption to the myelin covering that protects nerves .	Adrenoleukodystrophy  is a disease linked to the X chromosome . It is a result of fatty acid buildup caused by a defect in the very long chain of fatty acids transporter in peroxisomes, which then causes damage to the myelin sheath of the nerves , resulting in seizures and hyperactivity. Other symptoms include problems with speaking, listening, and understanding verbal instructions. In more detail, it is a disorder of peroxisomal fatty acid beta oxidation which results in the accumulation of very long chain fatty acids in tissues throughout the body.  The most severely affected tissues are the myelin in the central nervous system , the adrenal cortex , and the Leydig cells in the testes.  Clinically, ALD is a heterogeneous disorder, presenting with several distinct phenotypes , and no clear pattern of genotype -phenotype correlation.  As an X-linked disorder, ALD presents most commonly in males, however approximately 50% of heterozygote females show some symptoms later in life.  Approximately two-thirds of ALD patients will present with the childhood cerebral form of the disease, which is the most severe form.  It is characterized by normal development in early childhood, followed by rapid degeneration to a vegetative state .  The other forms of ALD vary in terms of onset and clinical severity, ranging from adrenal insufficiency to progressive paraparesis in early adulthood . ALD is caused by mutations in ABCD1 , a gene located on the X chromosome that codes for ALD, a peroxisomal membrane transporter protein.  The exact mechanism of the pathogenesis of the various forms of ALD is not known.  Biochemically, individuals with ALD show very high levels of unbranched, saturated, very long chain fatty acids, particularly cerotic acid .  The level of cerotic acid in plasma does not correlate with clinical presentation.  Treatment options for ALD are limited.  Dietary treatment is with Lorenzo's oil .  For the childhood cerebral form, stem cell transplant and gene therapy are options if the disease is detected early in the clinical course.  Adrenal insufficiency in ALD patients can be successfully treated.  ALD is the most common peroxisomal inborn error of metabolism, with an incidence estimated between 1:18,000 and 1:50,000.  It does not have a significantly higher incidence in any specific ethnic groups.	2.9686835
Liraglutide  is a Type 2 diabetes medication. It is a long-acting glucagon like peptide-1 agonist. It was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in early 2010. This medication is a once daily treatment of Type 2 diabetes.	Liraglutide , sold under the brand name Victoza among others, is a medication used to treat diabetes mellitus type 2 and obesity .  In diabetes it is a less preferred agent compared to metformin .   Its effects on long-term health outcomes like heart disease and life expectancy are unclear.   It is given by injection under the skin .  Common side effects include low blood sugar , nausea, dizziness, abdominal pain, and pain at the site of injection.  Other serious side effects may include medullary thyroid cancer , angioedema , pancreatitis , gallbladder disease , and kidney problems .  Use in pregnancy and breastfeeding is of unclear safety.  Liraglutide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist  also known as incretin mimetics .  It works by increasing insulin release from the pancreas and decreases excessive glucagon release.  Liraglutide was approved for medical use in the European Union in 2009, and in the United States in 2010.   In 2018, it was the 143rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 4 million prescriptions.  	2.9672565
Compulsory sterilization is a term used for laws that force certain groups of people to be sterilized so that they can no longer make babies . International Criminal Court considers compulsory sterilization for a " crime against humanity". Transgender persons are often obliged to undergo sterilization for legal rocognition of legal status depite the Principle 3 of the Yogyakarta Principles . Such laws were mainly introduced because of Eugenic views of the start of the 20th century . Today, most compulsory sterilizations are done to mentally ill people who are not able to handle a pregnancy on their own.  In China , compulsory sterilization is part of family planning .	Compulsory sterilization , also known as forced or coerced sterilization , is a government-mandated program to sterilize a specific group of people. Compulsory sterilization removes a person’s capacity to reproduce, usually through surgical procedures. Several countries implemented sterilization programs in the early 20th century.  Although such programs have been made illegal in most countries of the world, instances of forced or coerced sterilizations persist. Rationalizations for compulsory sterilization have included population control , gender discrimination , limiting the spread of HIV ,  "gender-normalizing" surgeries for intersex people, and ethnic genocide . In some countries, transgender individuals are required to undergo sterilization before gaining legal recognition of their gender , a practice that the United Nations Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment has described as a violation of the Yogyakarta Principles . 	2.966328
Cefalexin is a type of drug called an antibiotic . It is a type of antibiotic called a cephalosporin.  Cefalexin can treat some bacterial infections in areas including the ear , bone , joint , skin , and bladder .  It may also be used for some types of pneumonia and strep throat . Like other antibiotics, cefalexin cannot treat viral infections, such as the flu or common cold .  Cefalexin can be used in children and people over the age of 65.  Using it during pregnancy  or breastfeeding  has not been shown to cause harm to the baby.  People with kidney problems may need lower doses of cefalexin.  Common side effects include diarrhea , vomiting , and upset stomach . Allergic reactions can occur, such as rash or even trouble breathing .  An allergic reaction and infection with Clostridium difficile  , a severe diarrhea, is also possible.  Cefalexin can interact with some drugs.  These interactions are usually mild.  BCG can treat cancer and also is a tuberculosis vaccine .  Cefalexin and BCG cannot be taken together because the effects of BCG will decrease.  Alcohol may affect the absorption of the drug.  This drug can be taken by mouth in the form of a tablet, capsule, or suspension.  It is taken with or without food. 	Cefalexin , also spelled cephalexin , is an antibiotic that can treat a number of bacterial infections .  It kills gram-positive and some gram-negative bacteria by disrupting the growth of the bacterial cell wall.  Cefalexin is a beta-lactam antibiotic within the class of first-generation cephalosporins .  It works similarly to other agents within this class, including intravenous cefazolin , but can be taken by mouth.  Cefalexin can treat certain bacterial infections, including those of the middle ear , bone and joint , skin , and urinary tract .  It may also be used for certain types of pneumonia , strep throat , and to prevent bacterial endocarditis .  Cefalexin is not effective against infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus , most Enterococcus , or Pseudomonas .  Like other antibiotics, cefalexin cannot treat viral infections , such as the flu , common cold or acute bronchitis .  Cefalexin can be used in those who have mild or moderate allergies to penicillin .  However, it is not recommended in those with severe penicillin allergies.  Common side effects include stomach upset and diarrhea .  Allergic reactions or infections with Clostridium difficile , a cause of diarrhea, are also possible.  Use during pregnancy or breast feeding does not appear to be harmful to the baby.    It can be used in children and those over 65 years of age.  Those with kidney problems may require a decrease in dose. 	2.9659467
Anosmia is losing the the sense of smell . The word is also used for people who never had this sense. The loss can be temporary, or permanent. The conditions that cause a temporary loss of this sense include: Smelling things depends on two nerves , as well as the part of the brain which processes the information. Damage to this system will affect the sense of smell; permanent damage may lead to a permanent loss of the sense of small. There are tests that can be done to find the cause of the problem. The sense of smell also affects the sense of taste . People who cannot small smell have only the basic tastes: sweet , sour , bitter , salty , and umami .	Anosmia , also known as smell blindness , is the loss of the ability to detect one or more smells .   Anosmia may be temporary or permanent.  It differs from hyposmia , which is a decreased sensitivity to some or all smells.  Anosmia can be due to a number of factors, including an inflammation of the nasal mucosa , blockage of nasal passages or a destruction of one temporal lobe . Inflammation is due to chronic mucosa changes in the lining of the paranasal sinus and in the middle and superior turbinates . When anosmia is caused by inflammatory changes in the nasal passageways, it is treated simply by reducing inflammation.  It can be caused by chronic meningitis and neurosyphilis that would increase intracranial pressure over a long period of time,  and in some cases by ciliopathy ,  including ciliopathy due to primary ciliary dyskinesia . 	2.9616868
An anesthesiologist  is a doctor of medicine . An anesthesiologist  or anaesthetist  is a professional trained in anesthesia and perioperative medicine. Terminology varies between countries. The main jobs of an anesthesiologist are: The first anesthesiologist was John Snow .	Anesthesiology , anaesthesiology , anaesthesia or anaesthetics  is the medical specialty concerned with the total perioperative care of patients before, during and after surgery .  It encompasses anesthesia , intensive care medicine , critical emergency medicine , and pain medicine .  A physician specialized in this field of medicine is called an anesthesiologist , anaesthesiologist or anaesthetist , depending on the country .     The core element of the specialty is the study and use of anesthesia and anesthetics to safely support a patient's vital functions through the perioperative period. Since the 19th century, anesthesiology has developed from an experimental area with non-specialist practitioners using novel, untested drugs and techniques into what is now a highly refined, safe and effective field of medicine. In some countries  anesthesiologists comprise the largest single cohort of doctors in hospitals,   and their role can extend far beyond the traditional role of anesthesia care in the operating room , including fields such as providing pre-hospital emergency medicine , running intensive care units , transporting critically ill patients between facilities, and prehabilitation programs to optimize patients for surgery.  The word "anaesthesia" appears to have first been used in the modern medical sense of the word by Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. in 1846, and it gained currency when adopted by James Young Simpson the following year. "Anesthesiology" was proposed in 1889 by Henry William Blanc, and was re-coined by Mathias Joseph Seifert in 1902.  The name derives from  the Ancient Greek roots ἀν- an- , "not", αἴσθησις aísthēsis , “sensation”, and -λογία -logia , "study".	2.9511182
Delirium tremens  is a medical emergency .  It is the worst form of alcohol withdrawal ,   which can happen when a person who drinks a lot of alcohol suddenly stops drinking. " Delirium " means very bad confusion that comes on quickly; "tremens" means "shaking." Scientists think the DTs happen because the autonomic nervous system gets too excited.  It works too hard and will not shut off.  DTs were first written about in 1813.   Most people who stop drinking alcohol do not get the DTs. But some people are more likely to get the DTs if they suddenly stop drinking. DTs are more likely in people who: 	Delirium tremens  is a rapid onset of confusion usually caused by withdrawal from alcohol .  When it occurs, it is often three days into the withdrawal symptoms and lasts for two to three days.  Physical effects may include shaking , shivering, irregular heart rate , and sweating.  People may also hallucinate .  Occasionally, a very high body temperature or seizures may result in death.  Alcohol is one of the most dangerous drugs from which to withdraw .  Delirium tremens typically only occurs in people with a high intake of alcohol for more than a month.  A similar syndrome may occur with benzodiazepine and barbiturate withdrawal .  Withdrawal from stimulants such as cocaine do not have major medical complications.  In a person with delirium tremens it is important to rule out other associated problems such as electrolyte abnormalities , pancreatitis , and alcoholic hepatitis .  Prevention is by treating withdrawal symptoms.  If delirium tremens occurs, aggressive treatment improves outcomes.  Treatment in a quiet intensive care unit with sufficient light is often recommended.  Benzodiazepines are the medication of choice with diazepam , lorazepam , chlordiazepoxide , and oxazepam all commonly used.  They should be given until a person is lightly sleeping.  The antipsychotic haloperidol may also be used.  The vitamin thiamine is recommended.  Mortality without treatment is between 15% and 40%.  Currently death occurs in about 1% to 4% of cases. 	2.94829
Doctors Without Borders or Médecins Sans Frontières  is a non profitable international medical humanitarian organization created by doctors and journalists in France in 1971.  MSF gives emergency aid to people affected by wars , epidemics , famine , natural disasters and man-made disasters, or areas where there is no health care available. It provides this help to all people, regardless of their race, religion or political beliefs. In 1999 Doctors Without Borders was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize .  On 7 October 2015, President Barack Obama , also Nobel Peace Prize winner and at that time commander in chief , issued an apology to Doctors Without Borders for Kunduz hospital airstrike .

In 2019, the group was active in 70 countries with over 35,000 personnel mostly local doctors, nurses and other medical professionals, logistical experts, water and sanitation engineers and administrators.  Private donors provide about 90% of the organisation's funding, while corporate donations provide the rest, giving MSF an annual budget of approximately US$1.63 billion.  Médecins Sans Frontières was founded in 1971, in the aftermath of the Biafra secession , by a small group of French doctors and journalists who sought to expand accessibility to medical care across national boundaries and irrespective of race , religion , creed or political affiliation.  To that end, the organisation emphasises "independence and impartiality", and explicitly precludes political, economic, or religious factors in its decision making. For these reasons, it limits the amount of funding received from governments or intergovernmental organisations. These principles have allowed MSF to speak freely with respect to acts of war, corruption, or other hindrances to medical care or human well-being. Only once in its history, during the 1994 genocide in Rwanda , has the organisation called for military intervention.	2.9441566
The Josh Fight was a viral internet meme and pretend fight at Air Park in Lincoln, Nebraska , on April 24, 2021.   A college student named Josh Swain from Tucson, Arizona had the idea for the Josh Fight.  He was bored because of the COVID-19 pandemic , and this gave him the idea.  He talked about it on April 24, 2020. After a screenshot of a Facebook Messenger group chat involving several users named Josh spread widely on the internet , many people learned about the Josh Fight. Swain told other people named Josh Swain to meet at a set of coordinates , where they would fight for the right to be the only person to be called "Josh Swain." Later, more people with the first name Josh became interested.  Swain meant this as a joke, but several hundred people showed up on the day of the event. Despite the title, there was no violence involved and the gathering was lighthearted.  Fighting involved playing rock, paper, scissors and hitting each other with pool noodles made of light foam.  The fighters raised over $7000 for charity.  A four-year-old fighter, Joshua Vinson Jr., nicknamed "Little Josh," won the fight.

Health is "a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease " according to the World Health Organization .   Physical  is about the body. Mental is about how people think and feel. Social talks about how people live with other people. It is about family , work, school, and friends.  Physical fitness refers to good body health. It is dependent on genetic determinators and also on social, economic and ecological factors. That means, one's genes are partly responsible for one's physical health, but also other circumstances: where you live, how clean or polluted your water and the air around you is and also how good your social and medical system is. It is also the result of regular exercise , proper diet and nutrition , and proper rest for physical recovery . A person who is physically fit will be able to walk or run without getting breathless and they will be able to carry out the activities of everyday living and not need help. How much each person can do will depend on their age and whether they are a man or woman. A physically fit person usually has a normal weight for their height. The relation between their height and weight is called their Body Mass Index . A taller person can be heavier and still be fit. If a person is too heavy or too thin for their height it may affect their health.  Better health is central to human happiness and well-being. It also makes an important contribution to economic progress, as healthy populations live longer, are more productive, and save more. Many factors influence health status and a country's ability to provide quality health services for its people.  Mental health refers to a person's emotional and psychological well-being. "A state of emotional and psychological well-being in which an individual is able to use his or her thinking and emotional  abilities, function in society , and meet the ordinary demands of everyday life." One way to think about mental health is by looking at how well a person functions. Feeling capable and efficient ; being able to handle normal levels of stress , have good friends and family, and lead an independent life; and being able to "bounce back," or recover from hardships, are all signs of mental health.It’s normal for all of us to feel worried, sad, upset, or have difficult emotions from time-to-time. For most people though, these feelings are only temporary and are resolved without causing any long-term problems. However, for some people, these negative feelings can become worse over time and lead to a mental health problem such as depression, anxiety, stress or obsessive-compulsive disorder . 	Health is a state of physical, mental and social well-being in which disease and infirmity are absent.  The meaning of health has evolved over time. In keeping with the biomedical perspective, early definitions of health focused on the theme of the body's ability to function; health was seen as a state of normal function that could be disrupted from time to time by disease . An example of such a definition of health is: "a state characterized by anatomic, physiologic, and psychological integrity; ability to perform personally valued family, work, and community roles; ability to deal with physical , biological , psychological , and social stress ".  Then in 1948, in a radical departure from previous definitions, the World Health Organization  proposed a definition that aimed higher: linking health to well-being , in terms of "physical, mental, and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease and infirmity".  Although this definition was welcomed by some as being innovative, it was also criticized as being vague, excessively broad and was not construed as measurable. For a long time, it was set aside as an impractical ideal and most discussions of health returned to the practicality of the biomedical model. 	2.9305565
Intellectual disability is also called mental retardation, intellectual developmental disability, or general learning disability .  It is an illness of the brain. Intellectual disability often starts when someone is very young. To have an intellectual disability, a person must:  There are two major types of intellectual disability. The first is syndromic intellectual disability . This means that the person has a syndrome that causes intellectual disability, as well as medical issues and other problems. Down syndrome and fetal alcohol syndrome are two examples of syndromic intellectual disabilities.	Intellectual disability , also known as general learning disability  and formerly mental retardation ,   is a generalized neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by significantly impaired intellectual and adaptive functioning . It is defined by an IQ under 70 , in addition to deficits in two or more adaptive behaviors that affect everyday, general living. Intellectual functions are defined under DSM-V as reasoning, problem‑solving, planning, abstract thinking, judgment, academic learning, and learning from instruction and experience, and practical understanding confirmed by both clinical assessment and standardized tests. Adaptive behavior is defined in terms of conceptual, social, and practical skills involving tasks performed by people in their everyday lives.  Once focused almost entirely on cognition , the definition now includes both a component relating to mental functioning and one relating to an individual's functional skills in their daily environment. As a result of this focus on the person's abilities in practice, a person with an unusually low IQ may still not be considered to have an intellectual disability. 	2.9302623

An inhaler is a device for taking medications that are breathed in. Inhalers are also called "puffers" by some people, and used for all sorts of respiratory problems including asthmatic disorders.	An inhaler  is a medical device used for delivering medicines into the lungs through the work of a person's breathing. This allows medicines to be delivered to and absorbed in the lungs, which provides the ability for targeted medical treatment to this specific region of the body, as well as a reduction in the side effects of oral medications. There are a wide variety of inhalers, and they are commonly used to treat numerous medical conditions with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  being among the most notable.  Some of the common types of inhalers include meter-dosed inhalers , dry powder inhalers , soft mist inhalers, and nebulizers . Each device has advantages and disadvantages and can be selected based on specific patient needs, as well as age, coordination, and lung function.  Proper education on inhaler use is important to ensure that inhaled medication takes its proper effects in the lungs.  Inhalers are designed to deliver medication directly to the lungs through a person's own breathing. This may benefit a patient by providing medicines directly to areas of disease, allowing medication to take a greater effect on its intended target, and limit side effects of medications due to localized treatment.  Inhalers are used in a variety of different medical conditions with diseases of the lungs and respiratory system being among the most common. These conditions utilize medications designed to decrease airway inflammation and obstruction to allow for easier and less strained breathing.  Antibiotic medications have even been developed for inhalers to allow for direct delivery to areas of infection within the lungs.  Two of the most common conditions that warrant inhaler therapy are asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .  	2.9292407

Tinnitus is a symptom of hearing loss and other hearing problems. It is described as hearing sound in the head or ears that does not come from an outside source.  Many people will hear ringing, buzzing, hissing or whistling sounds, but tinnitus can be other sounds such as roaring and humming as well. Different people will hear different sounds from tinnitus but how they hear it can also be different. Tinnitus can be loud or quiet and it can be continuous or occasional and some people will not notice their tinnitus but some people become very annoyed from it, especially when then feel tired or stressed. There are many things that can cause people to get tinnitus. These are the main reasons: People of different range of age can develop tinnitus. It is not a disorder but the symptom of some underlying health condition.	Tinnitus is the perception of sound when no corresponding external sound is present.  Nearly everyone will experience a faint "normal tinnitus" in a completely quiet room but it is only of concern if it is bothersome or interferes with normal hearing or correlated with other problems.  While often described as a ringing, it may also sound like a clicking, buzzing, hiss, or roaring.  The sound may be soft or loud, low or high pitched , and often appears to be coming from one or both ears or from the head itself.  In some people, the sound may interfere with concentration and in some cases it is associated with anxiety and depression.  Tinnitus is usually associated with some degree of hearing loss and with decreased understanding in noisy environments.  It is common, affecting about 10–15% of people.  Most, however, tolerate it well, and it is a significant problem in only 1–2% of people.  The word tinnitus comes from the Latin tinnire which means "to ring".  Rather than a disease, tinnitus is a symptom that may result from various underlying causes and can may be generated at any level of the auditory system and structures beyond that system.  The most common causes are hearing damage, noise-induced hearing loss or age-related hearing loss, known as presbycusis .  Other causes include ear infections , disease of the heart or blood vessels , Ménière's disease , brain tumors , exposure to certain medications, a previous head injury , earwax , and sometimes, the tinnitus is suddenly perceived during a period of emotional stress .   It is more common in those with depression. 	2.922127
A pacemaker is a device created by Earl Bakken that helps to regulate your heart . It uses electrical pulses. If your heart is beating too fast, the pacemaker slows it down. If your heart slows down, the pacemaker will slightly speed it up, so that it goes back to a normal heart beat.	A cardiac pacemaker , is a medical device that generates electrical impulses delivered by electrodes to cause the heart muscle chambers  to contract and therefore pump blood; by doing so this device replaces and/or regulates the function of the electrical conduction system of the heart . The primary purpose of a pacemaker is to maintain an adequate heart rate , either because the heart's natural pacemaker is not fast enough, or because there is a block in the heart's electrical conduction system. Modern pacemakers are externally programmable and allow a cardiologist, particularly a cardiac electrophysiologist to select the optimal pacing modes for individual patients.  Modern devices are demand pacemakers , in which the stimulation of the heart is based on the dynamic demand of the circulatory system .   A specific type of pacemaker called a defibrillator combines pacemaker and defibrillator functions in a single implantable device, which should be called a defibrillator, for clarity. Others, called biventricular pacemakers have multiple electrodes stimulating differing positions within the lower heart chambers to improve synchronization of the ventricles , the lower chambers of the heart.	2.9220302
A clinical thermometer is a thermometer used to measure human body temperature . Most made in the 20th century are mercury-in-glass thermometer s. They are accurate and sensitive, having a narrow place where the mercury level rises very fast. A kink in the tube stops the mercury level from falling on it own. These thermometers are used in clinics by doctors,  it is a clinical thermometers they are also called a doctor's thermometers or medical thermometers.  Most show both Celsius scale and Fahrenheit temperature scales, and run from 35 degree Celsius to 42 degree Celsius. Medical thermometers are cleaned before and after each use, with alcohol . For centuries medical thermometers were large, and took many minutes to register a temperature.  In the 1860s smaller, better ones were made, and thus thermometers were more often used.  An ear thermometer was invented in the 1960s, which works quickly and easily.  Digital thermometers became widespread in the late 20th century.	A medical thermometer  is used for measuring human or animal body temperature . The tip of the thermometer is inserted into the mouth under the tongue , under the armpit , into the rectum via the anus , into the ear , or on the forehead . The medical thermometer began as an instrument more appropriately called a water thermoscope , constructed by Galileo Galilei circa 1592–1593. It lacked an accurate scale with which to measure temperature and could be affected by changes in atmospheric pressure.   Italian physician Santorio Santorio is the first known individual to have put a measurable scale on the thermoscope and wrote of it in 1625, though he possibly invented one as early as 1612. His models were bulky, impractical and took a fair amount of time to take an accurate oral reading of the patient's temperature.  	2.9172943
Naturopathy is a form of alternative medicine . It is based on the belief that a special energy called "vital energy" guides bodily functions such as metabolism , reproduction and growth .  Naturopaths mostly use holistic forms of treatment. They generally avoid the use of surgery and drugs . Many naturopaths reject modern science. Naturopathy is not supported by science.  The medical community does not believe that it works.   The term "naturopathy" comes from Greek and Latin. It means "nature disease".  Modern naturopathy developed from the Natural Cure movement in Europe.  	Naturopathy or naturopathic medicine is a form of alternative medicine that employs an array of pseudoscientific practices branded as "natural", "non-invasive", or promoting "self-healing". The ideology and methods of naturopathy are based on vitalism and folk medicine , rather than evidence-based medicine .  Naturopathic practitioners generally recommend against following modern medical practices , including but not limited to medical testing , drugs , vaccinations , and surgery .     Instead, naturopathic practice relies on unscientific notions, often leading naturopaths to diagnoses and treatments that have no factual merit.  	2.9165795
The White House Coronavirus Task Force was a United States Department of State task force that focuses on the spread and limiting of coronavirus disease 2019 .  The task force was created on January 29, 2020.  On February 26, 2020, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence was named to chair the task force, and Deborah Birx was named the response coordinator.

Retrograde amnesia is a type of amnesia when someone cannot remember what happened before the event that caused the memory loss . This is different from anterograde amnesia , when someone cannot remember what happened after the event.	Retrograde amnesia  is a loss of memory-access to events that occurred or information that was learned in the past. It is caused by an injury or the onset of a disease.  It tends to negatively affect episodic , autobiographical , and declarative memory , while keeping procedural memory intact without increasing difficulty for learning new information. RA can be temporally graded, or more permanent based on the severity of its cause. It is usually consistent with Ribot's law . The law states that subjects are more likely to lose memories closer to the traumatic incident than more memories that happened further from the incident.  The type of information that is forgotten can range from a specific memory, such as a single event, or a more general memory. This would resemble generic amnesia . Anterograde amnesia is a similar condition that deals with the inability to form new memories following the onset of an injury or disease. RA commonly results from damage to regions of the brain that are associated with episodic and declarative memory, including autobiographical information. In extreme cases, individuals may completely forget who they are. Generally, this is a more severe type of amnesia known as global , or generalized amnesia.  However, memory loss can also be selective or categorical, manifested by a person's inability to remember events related to a specific incident or topic. Patients also differ in durations of RA  and durations of what is forgotten . In temporally graded retrograde amnesia, victims eventually recover most memories following the onset of RA. This suggests that the hippocampal formation / consolidation, the process of coding new information,  is only used in systematic consolidation for temporary storage, and short periods of time. Systemic consolidation then moves the information and long-term consolidation takes place in other brain structures.  The fact that damage to the hippocampal formation can eventually overcome RA suggests that other brain structures are able to take over the jobs of the malfunctioning regions. RA can also progress and further deteriorate memory recollection, as in the case of Korsakoff syndrome and Alzheimer's disease , due to the ongoing nature of the damage caused by the illnesses. The degree to which different patients recover from RA differs in time  and content .	2.9080093
A Cesarean section   is a kind of surgery , which is usually done to make childbirth easier. In the past, this was done when there was a great risk to the health of the mother, or when normal childbirth through the vagina was not possible. More recently, it has also been done on request, without these reasons. In very rare cases, abortions are performed using this procedure, these are called Hysterotomy abortions . The first person to perform a modern Cesarean section was Ferdinand Adolf Kehrer , in 1881. In Latin , it is called Sectio caesarea , in English, the spelling Caesarean section also exists. The rate of babies delivered through Cesarean section varies: It is at a record level of 46% in China; levels of 25% and above are common in many Asian and European countries, Latin America, and the United States.  From about the 6th century, there  was Roman law that stated that a living foetus may not be buried with the mother, The Digest notes this to be a "lex regia". If this were the case, it would date from the time around 700 BC, when there were Roman kings.	Caesarean section , also known as C-section , or caesarean delivery , is the surgical procedure by which one or more babies are delivered through an incision in the mother's abdomen, often performed because vaginal delivery would put the baby or mother at risk.  Various Human groups have been attempting and actively doing the caesarean section for 100s to 1000s of years..Reasons for the operation include obstructed labor , twin pregnancy , high blood pressure in the mother, breech birth , and problems with the placenta or umbilical cord .   A caesarean delivery may be performed based upon the shape of the mother's pelvis or history of a previous C-section.   A trial of vaginal birth after C-section may be possible.  The World Health Organization recommends that caesarean section be performed only when medically necessary.   Some C-sections are performed without a medical reason, upon request by someone, usually the mother.  A C-section typically takes 45 minutes to an hour.  It may be done with a spinal block , where the woman is awake, or under general anesthesia .  A urinary catheter is used to drain the bladder , and the skin of the abdomen is then cleaned with an antiseptic .  An incision of about 15 cm  is then typically made through the mother's lower abdomen.  The uterus is then opened with a second incision and the baby delivered.  The incisions are then stitched closed.  A woman can typically begin breastfeeding as soon as she is out of the operating room and awake.  Often, several days are required in the hospital to recover sufficiently to return home. 	2.9075634
In medicine , a bypass usually means making another route for the blood to flow.  Sometimes an artery , the channel through which the blood flows, becomes blocked up.  The patient has a bypass operation .  Very often the surgeon will take part of a vein from the patient's leg and move it to the place with the blockage so that the blood can flow round the blocked part.	Bypass surgery refers to a class of surgeries involving rerouting a tubular body part.  Types include:	2.905985
A biopsy is a test in medicine where doctors remove cells and look at them closely under a microscope or do chemical analysis to see whether there is an illness . Biopsy is a Greek word, from the Greek words bio meaning "life" and opsia meaning see.	A biopsy is a medical test commonly performed by a surgeon , interventional radiologist , or an interventional cardiologist . The process involves extraction of sample cells or tissues for examination to determine the presence or extent of a disease. The tissue is generally examined under a microscope by a pathologist ; it may also be analyzed chemically. When an entire lump or suspicious area is removed, the procedure is called an excisional biopsy .  An incisional biopsy or core biopsy samples a portion of the abnormal tissue without attempting to remove the entire lesion or tumor. When a sample of tissue or fluid is removed with a needle in such a way that cells are removed without preserving the histological architecture of the tissue cells, the procedure is called a needle aspiration biopsy . Biopsies are most commonly performed for insight into possible cancerous or inflammatory conditions. The Arab physician Abulcasis  developed one of the earliest diagnostic biopsies. He used a needle  to puncture a goiter and then characterized the material.   The term biopsy reflects the Greek words βίος bios , "life," and ὄψις opsis , "a sight." 	2.903896
Bioethics is a field of ethics in philosophy that studies the ethical, legal and social issues in medicine and biology . It is often used to study how the new discoveries in science will affect humans, animals and nature.	Bioethics is the study of the ethical issues emerging from advances in biology and medicine .  It is also moral discernment as it relates to medical policy and practice. Bioethics are concerned with the ethical questions that arise in the relationships among life sciences , biotechnology , medicine and medical ethics , politics , law , theology and philosophy .  It includes the study of values relating to primary care and other branches of medicine . Ethics also relates to many other sciences outside the realm of biological sciences. The term Bioethics  was coined in 1926 by Fritz Jahr in an article about a "bioethical imperative" regarding the use of animals and plants in scientific research.  In 1970, the American biochemist Van Rensselaer Potter used the term to describe the relationship between the biosphere and a growing human population. Potter's work laid the foundation for global ethics , a discipline centered around the link between biology, ecology, medicine, and human values.   Sargent Shriver, the spouse of Eunice Kennedy Shriver, claimed that he had invented the word "bioethics" in the living room of his home in Bethesda, Maryland in 1970. He stated that he thought of the word after returning from a discussion earlier that evening at Georgetown University, where he discussed with others a possible Kennedy family sponsorship of an institute focused around the "application of moral philosophy to concrete medical dilemmas."  The field of bioethics has addressed a broad swathe of human inquiry; ranging from debates over the boundaries of life , surrogacy, the allocation of scarce health care resources , to the right to refuse medical care for religious or cultural reasons.  Bioethicists often disagree among themselves over the precise limits of their discipline, debating whether the field should concern itself with the ethical evaluation of all questions involving biology and medicine, or only a subset of these questions.  Some bioethicists would narrow ethical evaluation only to the morality of medical treatments or technological innovations, and the timing of medical treatment of humans. Others would broaden the scope of ethical evaluation to include the morality of all actions that might help or harm organisms capable of feeling fear.	2.9002845
Chiropractic is a form of alternative medicine . A chiropractor is a person who went to school to learn chiropractic. Chiropractors may diagnose and treat many conditions relating to muscles , joints , and nerves of the body . They may give what is called an "adjustment" to the body. An adjustment is a fast short push to an area of the patient 's spine or other joints to help their condition. Chiropractors do not use drugs to treat patients. They use natural treatments such as nutrition , exercise , physical therapy , adjustments, and massage in order to help their patients. Chiropractic has changed since it was created over 100 years ago because chiropractors learn new facts and do new research . Chiropractors have many different ways to treat their patients. They all use drug free treatments. Chiropractic is best known for helping people with spine pain , but chiropractors can also help other problems. There has been a debate as to whether or not chiropractic is classified as Pseudoscience .	Chiropractic is a pseudoscientific  alternative medicine  that is concerned with the diagnosis and treatment of mechanical disorders of the musculoskeletal system , especially the spine .  Chiropractors, especially those in the field's early history, have proposed that such disorders affect general health via the nervous system .  The main chiropractic treatment technique involves manual therapy , especially manipulation of the spine , other joints, and soft tissues , but may also include exercises and health and lifestyle counseling.  A chiropractor may have a Doctor of Chiropractic  degree and be referred to as a doctor, and in some jurisdictions can be called a chiropractic physician , but is not a Doctor of Medicine .   Systematic reviews of controlled clinical studies of treatments used by chiropractors have not found evidence that chiropractic manipulation is effective , with the possible exception of treatment for back pain .  A critical evaluation found that collectively, spinal manipulation was ineffective at treating any condition.  Spinal manipulation may be cost-effective for sub-acute or chronic low back pain but the results for acute low back pain were insufficient.  The efficacy and cost-effectiveness of maintenance chiropractic care are unknown. 	2.8976243
An online pharmacy is a pharmacy that operates on the Internet to sell medications to consumers.  There are online pharmacies in many countries of the world—from India, the U.S., Germany, the UK—and many other nations that sell to consumers in their own countries and often to consumers worldwide. Depending on its location and local regulations, an online pharmacy may or may not require prescriptions to purchase prescription medications. Prices at a given online pharmacy can vary from one city or country to another.  Typically, drug prices at online pharmacies located in countries with drug price controls in place  will have more affordable costs.  In contrast, costs at pharmacies in countries where there are no drug price controls  will usually be much higher.  Especially for consumers seeking low-priced medications, it can be very worthwhile to compare prices at various online pharmacies.  Prices can vary as much as 80 percent or more for one medication from one country to another.	An online pharmacy , internet pharmacy , or mail-order pharmacy is a pharmacy that operates over the Internet and sends orders to customers through mail, shipping companies, or online pharmacy web portal. Online pharmacies include: Conventional 'bricks and mortar' pharmacies usually have controlled drug distribution systems from the manufacturer, sufficient validation , and follow good distribution practices. Home delivery of pharmaceuticals can be a desirable convenience, but sometimes it can lead to problems with uncontrolled distribution.	2.8965116
A bandage is strip of cloth or other material that is used to stop and absorb blood from wounds . In common speech, the word "bandage" is often used to mean a dressing , though technically the two are different things. See these links:	A bandage is a piece of material used either to support a medical device such as a dressing or splint , or on its own to provide support to or to restrict the movement of a part of the body. When used with a dressing, the dressing is applied directly on a wound, and a bandage used to hold the dressing in place.  Other bandages are used without dressings, such as elastic bandages that are used to reduce swelling or provide support to a sprained ankle.  Tight bandages can be used to slow blood flow to an extremity, such as when a leg or arm is bleeding heavily. Bandages are available in a wide range of types, from generic cloth strips to specialized shaped bandages designed for a specific limb or part of the body.  Bandages can often be improvised as the situation demands, using clothing, blankets or other material.  In American English , the word bandage is often used to indicate a small gauze dressing attached to an adhesive bandage . The most common type of bandage is the gauze bandage, a woven strip of material with a Telfa absorbent barrier to prevent adhering to wounds. A gauze bandage can come in any number of widths and lengths and can be used for almost any bandage application, including holding a dressing in place.	2.8927877
Deaths by county per 100,000 inhabitants as of 27 August 2020 The COVID-19 pandemic was confirmed to have reached Albania on 8 March 2020 , a father and son who had travelled from Florence , Italy .  As of 10 September 2020, there are 10,860 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Albania .  After the first case was reported on 8 March, the Ministry of Health and Social Protection stated that a total of 65 people had been tested for COVID-19 , 2 of whom were positive the following day. 	The COVID-19 pandemic in Albania is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019  caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 . The first case in the Republic of Albania was reported in Tirana on 8 March 2020, when a patient and his adult son who had come from Florence , Italy tested positive.  Both men later recovered. On 21 December, health minister Ogerta Manastirliu announced the country has decided to suspend flights to and from the UK until January 6 because of a new COVID-19 mutation that transmits more quickly than other variants. All passengers arriving from the UK by land had to self-isolate for 14 days upon entry. The flight suspension took effect on Tuesday, 22 December. 	2.8927467

Chlorpromazine is an antipsychotic drug . It is the oldest such drug. It was developed in 1950. It is typically used to treat Schizophrenia . It has also been used to treat bipolar disorder . It has been shown to help uncontrollable hiccups disappear. It is also used to help with nausea and vomiting .	Chlorpromazine , marketed under the brand names Thorazine and Largactil among others, is an antipsychotic medication.  It is primarily used to treat psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia .  Other uses include the treatment of bipolar disorder , severe behavioral problems in children including those with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder , nausea and vomiting , anxiety before surgery, and hiccups that do not improve following other measures.  It can be given by mouth , by injection into a muscle , or into a vein .  Chlorpromazine is in the typical antipsychotic class,  and, chemically, is one of the phenothiazines . Its mechanism of action is not entirely clear but believed to be related to its ability as a dopamine antagonist .  It also has anti-serotonergic and antihistaminergic properties. 	2.886954
Alternative medicine describes practices used in place of conventional medical treatments. Some patients seek these practices along with conventional medicine . When the patient's medical doctor coordinates with an alternative medicine therapist, this is called "complementary medicine."  Alternative medicine includes practices that incorporate spiritual , metaphysical , or religious belief; non-evidence based practices, non-European medical traditions, or newly developed approaches to healing. Examples include acupuncture , chiropractic and homeopathy .	Alternative medicine is any practice that aims to achieve the healing effects of medicine , but which lacks biological plausibility and is untested , untestable or proven ineffective. Complementary medicine , complementary and alternative medicine , integrated medicine or integrative medicine , and holistic medicine are among many rebrandings of the same phenomenon. Alternative therapies share in common that they reside outside medical science , and rely on pseudoscience . Traditional practices become "alternative" when used outside their original settings without proper scientific explanation and evidence. Frequently used derogatory terms for the alternative are new-age or pseudo , with little distinction from quackery . Some alternative practices are based on theories that contradict the science of how the human body works; others resort to the supernatural or superstitious to explain their effect. In others, the practice is plausibly effective but has too many side effects . Alternative medicine is distinct from scientific medicine, which employs the scientific method to test plausible therapies by way of responsible and ethical clinical trials , producing evidence of either effect or of no effect. Research into alternative therapies often fails to follow proper research protocols , providing invalid results.	2.8821666
Health care or healthcare is the preservation of mental and physical health by preventing or treating illnesses through services offered by the health profession and its staff. Health care includes all reasonable and necessary medical aid, medical examinations, medical treatments , medical diagnoses, medical evaluations and medical services. The right to health care is considered one of human rights with international human rights law as well as social security . A primary care doctor  or primary care physician  is a doctor who provides general medical care. These doctors can answer health concerns and medical conditions a patient may have. They also can prescribe medicine for their patients, based on information gathered. In 1968, Victor Skumin proposed the term ″Culture of Health″, which has become widespread.   The main task of a Culture of Health is to implement innovative health programs that support a holistic approach to physical, mental and spiritual health .  Holism is the idea that natural systems  and their properties, should be viewed as wholes, not as collections of parts. According to Skumin, the culture of health is not only the mechanical connection of the two concepts —the concept of ″ culture ″ and the concept of ″ health ″. This is their synthesis , which forms a new quality, a new content. Skumin examines the culture of health as the specific science , that develops the theoretical and practical tasks of harmonious development of the spiritual, mental, and physical human force, forming of optimum environment, which provides a higher level of creativity of life. Thus, Skumin argues that the culture of health is a separate science, that creates new content. The main challenge of culture of health is the development of spiritual, mental and physical capabilities of man.  In 1994, Skumin was elected to the post of the President-founder of the World Organisation of Culture of Health  — International social movement "To Health via Culture".  	Health care , health-care , or healthcare is the maintenance or improvement of health via the prevention , diagnosis , treatment , recovery, or cure of disease , illness , injury , and other physical and mental impairments in people. Health care is delivered by health professionals and allied health fields . Medicine , dentistry , pharmacy , midwifery , nursing , optometry , audiology , psychology , occupational therapy , physical therapy , athletic training and other health professions are all part of health care. It includes work done in providing primary care , secondary care, and tertiary care , as well as in public health . Access to health care may vary across countries, communities, and individuals, influenced by social and economic conditions as well as health policies . Providing health care services means "the timely use of personal health services to achieve the best possible health outcomes".  Factors to consider in terms of healthcare access include financial limitations , geographic barriers , and personal limitations .  Limitations to health care services affects negatively the use of medical services, the efficacy of treatments, and overall outcome . Health care systems are organizations established to meet the health needs of targeted populations. According to the World Health Organization , a well-functioning health care system requires a financing mechanism, a well-trained and adequately paid workforce , reliable information on which to base decisions and policies , and well maintained health facilities to deliver quality medicines and technologies.	2.8809412
A peripheral nerve block  is when the signals travelling along a nerve are blocked. This is usually done deliberately, usually as a form of anesthesia . Such a block can last between a few hours to a few weeks.	Nerve block or regional nerve blockade is any deliberate interruption of signals traveling along a nerve, often for the purpose of pain relief. Local anesthetic nerve block  is a short-term block, usually lasting hours or days, involving the injection of an anesthetic, a corticosteroid , and other agents onto or near a nerve. Neurolytic block , the deliberate temporary degeneration of nerve fibers through the application of chemicals, heat, or freezing, produces a block that may persist for weeks, months, or indefinitely. Neurectomy , the cutting through or removal of a nerve or a section of a nerve, usually produces a permanent block. Because neurectomy of a sensory nerve is often followed, months later, by the emergence of new, more intense pain, sensory nerve neurectomy is rarely performed. The concept of nerve block sometimes includes central nerve block , which includes epidural and spinal anaesthesia .  Local anesthetic is often combined with other drugs to potentiate or prolong the analgesia produced by the nerve block. These adjuvants may include epinephrine , corticosteroids , opioids , ketamine , or alpha-adrenergic agonists . These blocks can be either single treatments, multiple injections over a period of time, or continuous infusions. A continuous peripheral nerve block can be introduced into a limb undergoing surgery – for example, a femoral nerve block to prevent pain in knee replacement . 	2.8801723
Adjustment disorder happens when a person is unable to cope with or adjust to certain stressors. People who have adjustment disorder often have symptoms such as losing interest, being sad , crying, feeling anxious and constant worries. These symptoms are from outside stressors, although they resolve when individuals become used to the situations. The stressors may include, although are not limited to: hurricanes , being abused, accidents and traumatic events. This problem can happen at any age. In adults, however, adult women are diagnosed almost twice as often as men. 	Adjustment disorder is a maladaptive response to a psychosocial stressor that occurs when an individual has significant difficulty adjusting to or coping with a stressful psychosocial event. The maladaptive response usually involves otherwise normal emotional and behavioral reactions that manifest more intensely than usual , causing marked distress, preoccupation with the stressor and its consequences, and functional impairment.     Diagnosis of AjD is quite common; there is an estimated incidence of 5–21% among psychiatric consultation services for adults. Adult women are diagnosed twice as often as are adult men. Among children and adolescents, girls and boys are equally likely to receive this diagnosis.  : 681 AjD was introduced into the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders in 1980. Prior to that, it was called "transient situational disturbance."  Some emotional signs of adjustment disorder are: sadness, hopelessness, lack of enjoyment, crying spells, nervousness, anxiety, desperation, feeling overwhelmed and thoughts of suicide, performing poorly in school/work etc.	2.8749506
Fetal viability is a medical and a legal term. It describes the ability of an unborn child to survive outside the womb . For the first three months of pregnancy , the unborn child is called embryo , after that it is called fetus . Usually, children are born after 40 weeks of pregnancy. Very few children are born before the mother reaches 24 weeks of pregnancy. If they are born alive, very few will survive. About 50 to 70 percent of children born from the 25th week of pregnancy will survive. In the 24th week, the survival chance is 30 to 50 percent. The point at which the child has a 50 percent chance of surviving is called limit of viability .	Fetal viability or foetal viability is the ability of a fetus to survive outside the uterus .  Viability , as the word has been used in United States constitutional law since Roe v. Wade , is the potential of the fetus to survive outside the uterus after birth, natural or induced, when supported by up-to-date medicine. Fetal viability depends largely on the fetal organ maturity, and environmental conditions.  According to Websters Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary of the English Language, viability of a fetus means having reached such a stage of development as to be capable of living, under normal conditions, outside the uterus. Viability exists as a function of biomedical and technological capacities, which are different in different parts of the world. As a consequence, there is, at the present time, no worldwide, uniform gestational age that defines viability.  According to the McGraw-Hill medical dictionary a nonviable fetus is "an expelled or delivered fetus which, although living, cannot possibly survive to the point of sustaining life independently, even with support of the best available medical therapy."  A legal definition states: "Nonviable means not capable of living, growing, or developing and functioning successfully. It is antithesis of viable, which is defined as having attained such form and development of organs as to be normally capable of living outside the uterus."  	2.8725872

Bone metastases are when a cancer spreads to the bones . This is called metastasis . People with breast and prostate cancer have more bone metastases than other cancers. However, almost any other cancer can spread to the bone. Symptoms of bone metastases include:	Bone metastases , or osseous metastatic disease, is a category of cancer metastases that results from primary tumor invasion to bone .  Bone-originating primary tumors such as osteosarcoma , chondrosarcoma , and Ewing's sarcoma are rare.  Unlike hematological malignancies that originate in the blood and form non-solid tumors, bone metastases generally arise from epithelial tumors and form a solid mass inside the bone.  Bone metastases cause severe pain, characterized by a dull, constant ache with periodic spikes of incident pain .  Under normal conditions, bone undergoes a continuous remodeling through osteoclast -mediated bone resorption and osteoblast -mediated bone deposition.  These processes are normally tightly regulated within bone to maintain bone structure and calcium homeostasis in the body.  Disregulation of these processes by tumor cells leads to either osteoblastic or osteolytic lesions, reflective of the underlying mechanism of development.  Typically, osteolytic metastases are more aggressive than osteoblastic metastases, which have a slower course.  Regardless of the phenotype, though, bone metastases show osteoclast proliferation and hypertrophy .  Primary tumors	2.8707092
Folding@Home is a distributed computing project that helps doctors at Stanford University learn about and cure diseases .  When parts of the human body do not work right, they make people sick. Folding@Home looks at the parts called proteins . When these proteins do not work right, they can make people sick with things like Alzheimer's , Mad Cow disease , and many types of cancer .  The project uses the idle processing resources of thousands of personal computers owned by volunteers who have installed the software on their systems. Instead of using an expensive supercomputer many user's computers can do the same work. The software was first available for the Sony PlayStation 3 .  It can also run in a Google Chrome window .  It is now available for a wide variety of Android mobile devices . 	Folding@home  is a distributed computing project aimed to help scientists develop new therapeutics for a variety of diseases by the means of simulating protein dynamics. This includes the process of protein folding and the movements of proteins, and is reliant on simulations run on volunteers' personal computers.  Folding@home is currently based at Washington University in St. Louis and led by Greg Bowman, a former student of Vijay Pande .  The project utilizes central processing units , graphics processing units , PlayStation 3s , Message Passing Interface , and some Sony Xperia smartphones for distributed computing and scientific research. The project uses statistical simulation methodology that is a paradigm shift from traditional computing methods.  As part of the client–server model network architecture , the volunteered machines each receive pieces of a simulation , complete them, and return them to the project's database servers , where the units are compiled into an overall simulation. Volunteers can track their contributions on the Folding@home website, which makes volunteers' participation competitive and encourages long-term involvement. Folding@home is one of the world's fastest computing systems. With heightened interest in the project as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic ,  the system achieved a speed of approximately 1.22 exaflops by late March 2020 and reached 2.43 exaflops by April 12, 2020,  making it the world's first exaflop computing system . This level of performance from its large-scale computing network has allowed researchers to run computationally costly atomic-level simulations of protein folding thousands of times longer than formerly achieved. Since its launch on October 1, 2000, the Pande Lab has produced 225 scientific research papers as a direct result of Folding@home.  Results from the project's simulations agree well with experiments.   	2.8671434
Behaviour therapy is used for a number of methods of psychotherapy . Ivan Pavlov found that it is possible to "learn" how to react to a stimulus . His method is known as classical conditioning today. Behaviour therapy tries to use this knowledge to change the behaviour of people. In that way, people "learn" how to cope with their fears, for example. In a similar manner, people can be helped to cope with a number of mental disorders . One well known kind of behaviour therapy is exposure therapy : People with fears are "exposed" to them, and learn how to cope. As an example, someone who is afraid of spiders will be exposed to spiders.	Behaviour therapy or behavioural psychotherapy is a broad term referring to clinical psychotherapy that uses techniques derived from behaviourism and/or cognitive psychology . It looks at specific, learned behaviours and how the environment, or other people's mental states , influences those behaviours, and consists of techniques based on learning theory, such as respondent or operant conditioning . Behaviourists who practice these techniques are either behaviour analysts or cognitive-behavioural therapists .  They tend to look for treatment outcomes that are objectively measurable.  Behaviour therapy does not involve one specific method, but it has a wide range of techniques that can be used to treat a person's psychological problems.  Behavioural psychotherapy is sometimes juxtaposed with cognitive psychotherapy . While cognitive behavioural therapy integrates aspects of both approaches, such as cognitive restructuring , positive reinforcement , habituation , counterconditioning , and modelling . Applied behaviour analysis  is the application of behaviour analysis that focuses on functionally assessing how behaviour is influenced by the observable learning environment and how to change such behaviour through contingency management or exposure therapies , which are used throughout clinical behaviour analysis therapies or other interventions based on the same learning principles.	2.8644483
Beta blockers is the name for a class of drugs that inhibit the hormone adrenalin and the neurotransmitter noradrenalin . Adrenalin is mainly released in stress situations; blocking its pathway will lead to lowering the heart rate, and blood pressure .	Beta blockers  are a class of medications that are predominantly used to manage abnormal heart rhythms , and to protect the heart from a second heart attack  after a first heart attack .  They are also widely used to treat high blood pressure , although they are no longer the first choice for initial treatment of most patients.  Beta blockers are competitive antagonists that block the receptor sites for the endogenous catecholamines epinephrine  and norepinephrine  on adrenergic beta receptors , of the sympathetic nervous system , which mediates the fight-or-flight response .   Some block activation of all types of β-adrenergic receptors and others are selective for one of the three known types of beta receptors, designated β 1 , β 2 and β 3 receptors.  β 1 -adrenergic receptors are located mainly in the heart and in the kidneys.  β 2 -adrenergic receptors are located mainly in the lungs, gastrointestinal tract, liver, uterus, vascular smooth muscle, and skeletal muscle.  β 3 -adrenergic receptors are located in fat cells. 	2.8552492
Biomedical engineering is the study of medical equipment used in an environment of care or training and how this equipment interfaces with the human body . Biomedical engineers design , test , modify, recommend modification of, and evaluate all medical equipment used to interface or interact with the human body. In addition to these functions, clinical engineers usually supervise the biomedical equipment maintenance function within an environment of care.  The medical devices include man-made hands, arms, and legs to replace lost ones and, also, Dialysis machines which clean the blood of a person with damaged kidneys.	Biomedical engineering  or medical engineering is the application of engineering principles and design concepts to medicine and biology for healthcare purposes . BME is also traditionally known as "bioengineering", but this term has come to also refer to biological engineering . This field seeks to close the gap between engineering and medicine , combining the design and problem-solving skills of engineering with medical biological sciences to advance health care treatment, including diagnosis , monitoring , and therapy .   Also included under the scope of a biomedical engineer is the management of current medical equipment in hospitals while adhering to relevant industry standards. This involves making equipment recommendations, procurement, routine testing, and preventive maintenance, a role also known as a Biomedical Equipment Technician  or as clinical engineering . Biomedical engineering has recently emerged as its own study, as compared to many other engineering fields. Such an evolution is common as a new field transitions from being an interdisciplinary specialization among already-established fields to being considered a field in itself. Much of the work in biomedical engineering consists of research and development , spanning a broad array of subfields . Prominent biomedical engineering applications include the development of biocompatible prostheses , various diagnostic and therapeutic medical devices ranging from clinical equipment to micro-implants, common imaging equipment such as MRIs and EKG /ECGs, regenerative tissue growth, pharmaceutical drugs and therapeutic biologicals. Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary field that develops methods and software tools for understanding biological data. As an interdisciplinary field of science, bioinformatics combines computer science, statistics, mathematics, and engineering to analyze and interpret biological data.	2.8532877
Diclofenac is a non-steroidal ant-inflammatory drug .  It can be used as an analgesic and antipyretic. It is often used to treat bruises and strain injuiries.  Research experiments conducted in 2013, showed that Diclofenac increased the risk of heart attacks and stroke. 	Diclofenac , sold under the brand name Voltaren among others, is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug  used to treat pain and inflammatory diseases such as gout .  It is taken by mouth, rectally in a suppository, used by injection, or applied to the skin.   Improvements in pain last for as much as eight hours.  It is also available in combination with misoprostol in an effort to decrease stomach problems.  Common side effects include abdominal pain , gastrointestinal bleeding , nausea, dizziness, headache, and swelling.  Serious side effects may include heart disease , stroke , kidney problems , and stomach ulceration .   Use is not recommended in the third trimester of pregnancy .  It is likely safe during breastfeeding .  It is believed to work by decreasing the production of prostaglandin .  It blocks both cycloxygenase-1  and cycloxygenase-2 . 	2.8524334
Detoxification is when any toxic thing is removed from the human body, for example alcohol or poison.  A healthy lifestyle along with regular exercise can help you to remove toxins from the body. 	Detoxification or detoxication   is the physiological or medicinal removal of toxic substances from a living organism , including the human body, which is mainly carried out by the liver. Additionally, it can refer to the period of drug withdrawal during which an organism returns to homeostasis after long-term use of an addictive substance.   In medicine , detoxification can be achieved by decontamination of poison ingestion and the use of antidotes as well as techniques such as dialysis and  chelation therapy .  Many alternative medicine practitioners promote various types of detoxification such as detoxification diets . Scientists have described these as a "waste of time and money".   Sense About Science , a UK-based charitable trust, determined that most such dietary "detox" claims lack any supporting evidence.   The liver and kidney are naturally capable of detox, as are intracellular  proteins such as CYP enyzmes . In cases of kidney failure , the action of the kidneys is mimicked by dialysis ; kidney and liver transplants are also used for kidney and liver failure, respectively.	2.8414652
Cyclothymia is a mental illness characterized by mood swings - a mood disorder . The disease is a milder version of bipolar disorder . The mood swings are usually less extreme. Mood swings can be spontaneous, or triggered by an event. Cyclothymia is also an old name for bipolar disorder.	Cyclothymia , also known as cyclothymic disorder is a mental disorder that involves numerous periods of symptoms of depression and periods of symptoms of elevated mood.  These symptoms, however, are not sufficient to be a major depressive episode or a hypomanic episode .  Symptoms must last for more than one year in children and two years in adults.  The cause of cyclothymia is unknown.  Risk factors include a family history of bipolar disorder .  Cyclothymia differs from bipolar in that major depression, mania , or hypomania have never occurred.  Treatment is generally with counseling and mood stabilizers such as lithium .  It is estimated that 0.4-1% of people have cyclothymia at some point in their life.  Onset is typically in late childhood to early adulthood.  Males and females are affected equally often. 	2.837732
The COVID-19 pandemic in Australia began on 25 January 2020, in Victoria . A man who had returned from Wuhan , China, tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 .  The Australian government stopped all non-residents from entering the country on 20 March.  Social distancing rules were put in place on 21 March. The state governments closed "non-essential" services.   This included social gathering places such as hotels and clubs, but not businesses such as construction, manufacturing and many retail stores.  The number of new cases grew sharply, until reaching about 350 per day on 22 March. The numbers stayed around 350, and then started falling at the beginning of April. At the end of April it was under 20 cases per day.  As of 15 February 2021, there were 28,098 cases and 908 deaths in Australia. A virus that caused a respiratory illness was first seen in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019. It reported to the World Health Organisation  on 31 December 2019.

An antiseptic is a substance that is applied to lesions or wounds of the skin to kill germs . This helps prevent the wound becoming infected . Commonly used antiseptics include alcohol , iodine and mercury compounds . Antiseptics are different from antibiotics . Antiseptics can only be used on the skin, antibiotics can also be used internally, through the blood and lymphatic systems . They are also different from disinfectants : Disinfectants are used on non-living objects only, because they are dangerous to the living.	Antiseptics  are antimicrobial substances that are applied to living tissue / skin to reduce the possibility of infection , sepsis , or putrefaction . Antiseptics are generally distinguished from antibiotics by the latter's ability to safely destroy bacteria within the body, and from disinfectants , which destroy microorganisms found on non-living objects.  Some antiseptics are true germicides , capable of destroying microbes , while others are bacteriostatic and only prevent or inhibit their growth.  Antibacterials include antiseptics that have the proven ability to act against bacteria. Microbicides which destroy virus particles are called viricides or antivirals . Antifungals , also known as antimycotics , are pharmaceutical fungicides used to treat and prevent mycosis .	2.8280034

An anticoagulant is a chemical injected under the skin or directly into a vein that stops blood clots .	Anticoagulants , commonly known as blood thinners , are chemical substances that prevent or reduce coagulation of blood , prolonging the clotting time .  Some of them occur naturally in blood-eating animals such as leeches and mosquitoes , where they help keep the bite area unclotted long enough for the animal to obtain some blood.   As a class of medications , anticoagulants are used in therapy for thrombotic disorders .  Oral anticoagulants  are taken by many people in pill or tablet form, and various intravenous anticoagulant dosage forms are used in hospitals.   Some anticoagulants are used in medical equipment, such as sample tubes, blood transfusion bags, heart-lung machines , and dialysis equipment.   One of the first anticoagulants, warfarin, was initially approved as a rodenticide .  Anticoagulants are closely related to antiplatelet drugs and thrombolytic drugs by manipulating the various pathways of blood coagulation.  Specifically, antiplatelet drugs inhibit platelet aggregation , whereas anticoagulants inhibit specific pathways of the coagulation cascade, which happens after the initial platelet aggregation and ultimately leads to formation of fibrin and stable aggregated platelet products.   Common anticoagulants include warfarin and heparin . 	2.8216672
Doctor of Medicine  is a doctoral degree for physicians . The degree is given by medical schools . It is a professional doctorate / first professional degree  in some countries, including the United States and Canada . Students need to have completed 90 to 120 credit hours of university level work   and in most cases should already have a Bachelors Degree. In other countries, such as the United Kingdom and Germany , the Doctor of Medicine is an advanced academic research degree similar to a PhD or a higher doctorate .  In Britain , Ireland , and many Commonwealth nations, the qualifying medical degree is the Bachelor of Science in Medicine, Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery  and is the same as the M.D. degree in the U.S. system. In these countries it is illegal to prescribe scrips  and perform operations without the basic degree; also usual is the membership of appropriate medical and/or surgical societies. The societies  act as a kind of sophisticated trades union for doctors. In the British system, the General Medical Council has legal authority for the medical register of doctors licensed to practice medicine. They can and do hold tribunals to decide whether doctors accused of misdeeds should be struck off the medical register. Therefore, to practice it is necessary not only to hold the medical degree, but also to be on the register.	Doctor of Medicine  is a medical degree , the meaning of which varies between different jurisdictions. In the United States , and some other countries, the M.D. denotes a professional graduate degree . This generally arose because many in 18th-century medical professions trained in Scotland , which used the M.D. degree nomenclature. In England, however, Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery was used and eventually in the 19th century became the standard in Scotland too. Thus, in the United Kingdom , Ireland and other countries, the M.D. is a research doctorate , higher doctorate , honorary doctorate or applied clinical degree restricted to those who already hold a professional degree in medicine; in those countries, the equivalent professional to the North American and some others use of M.D. is still typically titled Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery .  The first medical degrees were awarded by the Schola Medica Salernitana around the year 1000, including to women such as Trota of Salerno .   The degrees received legal sanction in 1137 by Roger II of Sicily and in 1231 by Emperor Federico II , in the Constitution of Melfi .  In the titles XLIV-LXXXIX of the third book of the Constitutions of 1231, it was established that the activity of a physician  could only be carried out by physicians holding a medical degree, the Licentia Medendi , by the Schola Medica Salernitana .   This degree was awarded after a curriculum composed of three years of study of logic , five years of medical studies , an examination of a commission composed of the professors of the university, a one-year apprenticeship with an expert doctor, and a final examination before the commissioners of the Royal Curia and the Provincial Curias.  In 1703, the University of Glasgow 's first medical graduate, Samuel Benion, was issued with the academic degree of Doctor of Medicine. 	2.8202858
Jaundice  is when the skin and the whites of the eyes become a yellow color.  People with jaundice have a problem with their liver , which stops it from removing heme properly. Heme  changes to a chemical called bilirubin after red blood cell death.  Bilirubin causes the yellow coloring of the skin. Jaundice is common in newly born babies . It usually starts the second day after birth.  Jaundice can also be caused by other diseases, like malaria , hepatitis , or gallstones. Jaundice is the most common of all liver problems. The yellow colour of the skin and mucous membranes happens because of an increase in the bile pigment, bilirubin, in the blood .  The bile , made by the liver, is a vital digestive fluid needed for proper nutrition. It also stops decaying changes in food. If the bile is stopped from entering the intestines there is an increase in gases and other products. Normally, the production of bile and its flow is constant.	Jaundice , also known as icterus , is a yellowish or greenish pigmentation of the skin and whites of the eyes due to high bilirubin levels .   Jaundice in adults is typically a sign indicating the presence of underlying diseases involving abnormal heme metabolism , liver dysfunction , or biliary-tract obstruction.  The prevalence of jaundice in adults is rare, while jaundice in babies is common, with an estimated 80% affected during their first week of life.  The most commonly associated symptoms of jaundice are itchiness ,  pale feces , and dark urine .  Normal levels of bilirubin in blood are below 1.0 mg / dl , while levels over 2–3 mg/dl  typically result in jaundice.   High blood bilirubin is divided into two types - unconjugated  and conjugated bilirubin.  Causes of jaundice vary from nonserious to potentially fatal.  High unconjugated bilirubin may be due to excess red blood cell breakdown , large bruises , genetic conditions such as Gilbert's syndrome , not eating for a prolonged period of time, newborn jaundice, or thyroid problems .   High conjugated bilirubin may be due to liver diseases such as cirrhosis or hepatitis , infections, medications , or blockage of the bile duct ,.  due to factors including gallstones , cancer , or pancreatitis .  Other conditions can also cause yellowish skin, but are not jaundice, including carotenemia , which can develop from eating large amounts of foods containing carotene — or medications such as rifampin . 	2.8157213
Gangrene is a serious medical condition that causes the decay and death of body tissue , usually in the extremities such as the fingers, hands, toes, and feet. The two main types of gangrene are dry gangrene and wet gangrene. A third less common type is a form of wet gangrene known as gas gangrene .  A very rare type which affects the internal organs is known as internal gangrene. Dry gangrene is usually caused by a loss of blood supply to the affected area, such as may happen following an injury which damages the blood vessels to the affected area. Wet gangrene usually occurs when a wound becomes infected with various types of bacteria . Gas gangrene is usually  caused by clostridium bacteria and mainly affects the muscles . Internal gangrene affects the internal organs, usually the intestines , gallbladder , or appendix . There are a number of risk factors which increase a person's chances of getting gangrene. These includes advanced blockage of the arteries in medical conditions such as diabetes .	Gangrene is a type of tissue death caused by a lack of blood supply .  Symptoms may include a change in skin color to red or black, numbness, swelling, pain, skin breakdown, and coolness.  The feet and hands are most commonly affected.  If the gangrene is caused by an infectious agent it may present with a fever or sepsis .  Risk factors include diabetes , peripheral arterial disease , smoking , major trauma , alcoholism , HIV/AIDS , frostbite , influenza , COVID-19 , dengue fever , malaria , plague , meningococcal disease , Group B streptococcal infection and Raynaud's syndrome .   It can be classified as dry gangrene , wet gangrene , gas gangrene , internal gangrene , and necrotizing fasciitis .  The diagnosis of gangrene is based on symptoms and supported by tests such as medical imaging .  Treatment may involve surgery to remove the dead tissue, antibiotics to treat any infection, and efforts to address the underlying cause.  Surgical efforts may include debridement , amputation , or the use of maggot therapy .  Efforts to treat the underlying cause may include bypass surgery or angioplasty .  In certain cases, hyperbaric oxygen therapy may be useful.  How commonly the condition occurs is unknown. 	2.811661
Chorea  is the name for a set of symptoms caused by some neurological conditions . The word "chorea" comes from Greek , where it means " dance ". People with chorea move without being able to control those movements. The movements seem to spread from one muscle to the next. Chorea is one of the main symptoms of Huntington's disease . Some forms of chorea are not linked to neurological conditions, though. Chorea can develop as a complication of pregnancy .  It can be a sign of hyperthyroidism . It can also be caused by drugs taken in the wrong dose. For example, L-Dopa , certain forms of birth control , or certain antipsychotics can cause chorea if they are used in the wrong doses.	Chorea  is an abnormal involuntary movement disorder , one of a group of neurological disorders called dyskinesias . The term chorea is derived from the Ancient Greek : χορεία , as the quick movements of the feet or hands are comparable to dancing. The term hemichorea refers to chorea of one side of the body, such as chorea of one arm but not both . Chorea is characterized by brief, semi-directed, irregular movements that are not repetitive or rhythmic, but appear to flow from one muscle to the next. These 'dance-like' movements of chorea often occur with athetosis , which adds twisting and writhing movements. Walking may become difficult, and include odd postures and leg movements.	2.807781

Citalopram  is an antidepressant used to treat major depression and off-label conditions. This medicine was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in the 1990s. Adverse affects from this medicine include although are not limited to drowsiness, nausea , vivid dreaming, dry mouth and trembling. Citalopram is also used for anxiety conditions and panic disorder .	Citalopram , sold under the brand name Celexa among others, is an antidepressant of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor  class.   It is used to treat major depressive disorder , obsessive compulsive disorder , panic disorder , and social phobia .  The antidepressant effects may take one to four weeks to occur.  It is taken by mouth.   Common side effects include nausea, trouble sleeping, sexual problems, shakiness, feeling tired, and sweating.  Serious side effects include an increased risk of suicide in those under the age of 25, serotonin syndrome , glaucoma , and QT prolongation .  It should not be used in someone on a MAO inhibitor .  Antidepressant discontinuation syndrome may occur when stopped.  There are concerns that use during pregnancy may harm the fetus. 	2.8061996
In sport , doping is the use of a drug that athletes or competitors are not allowed to use. Certain drugs, such as steroids , are not allowed  in professional sports. This is because they can help a competitor's performance, by making them stronger or faster. This gives them an unfair advantage over other competitors. The drugs may be legal, but competitors will not be allowed to use them. Many sports make competitors take a drug test to prove that they are not using any drugs.	In competitive sports, doping is the use of banned athletic performance-enhancing drugs by athletic competitors.  The term doping is widely used by organizations that regulate sporting competitions. The use of drugs to enhance performance is considered unethical, and therefore prohibited, by most international sports organizations, including the International Olympic Committee . Furthermore, athletes  taking explicit measures to evade detection exacerbate the ethical violation with overt deception and cheating . The origins of doping in sports go back to the very creation of sport itself. From ancient usage of substances in chariot racing to more recent controversies in baseball and cycling , popular views among athletes have varied widely from country to country over the years. The general trend among authorities and sporting organizations over the past several decades has been to strictly regulate the use of drugs in sport. The reasons for the ban are mainly the health risks of performance-enhancing drugs, the equality of opportunity for athletes, and the exemplary effect of drug-free sport for the public. Anti-doping authorities state that using performance-enhancing drugs goes against the "spirit of sport".	2.8034065
Gynecomastia is when the breast in male humans are bigger than normal.  It has been known to be a symptom of obesity . 	Gynecomastia   is the abnormal non-cancerous enlargement of one or both breasts in men due to the growth of breast tissue as a result of a hormone imbalance between estrogen and androgen .   Gynecomastia can cause significant psychological distress or unease . 	2.7989252
Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging  is a special type of MRI that makes it possible to watch different areas of a person's brain while they do different tasks.  A functional MRI shows the use of oxygen in different brain areas. The Deoxyhemoglobin in blood absorbs a radiowave signal and later emits it . Oxyhemoglobin does not. When an area of the brain is active, the blood flow to that area increases and more oxyhemoglobin is delivered to supply the active cells with oxygen. This means less of the signal is absorbed. An active area of the  brain absorbs and emits less energy than a less active area. This can be seen live as it is happening when different areas of the brain 'light up' on the images as they become less active.	Functional magnetic resonance imaging or functional MRI  measures brain activity by detecting changes associated with blood flow .   This technique relies on the fact that cerebral blood flow and neuronal activation are coupled. When an area of the brain is in use, blood flow to that region also increases.  The primary form of fMRI uses the blood-oxygen-level dependent  contrast,  discovered by Seiji Ogawa in 1990. This is a type of specialized brain and body scan used to map neural activity in the brain or spinal cord of humans or other animals by imaging the change in blood flow  related to energy use by brain cells.  Since the early 1990s, fMRI has come to dominate brain mapping research because it does not require people to undergo injections or surgery, to ingest substances, or to be exposed to ionizing radiation.  This measure is frequently corrupted by noise from various sources; hence, statistical procedures are used to extract the underlying signal.  The resulting brain activation can be graphically represented by color-coding the strength of activation across the brain or the specific region studied.  The technique can localize activity to within millimeters but, using standard techniques, no better than within a window of a few seconds.  Other methods of obtaining contrast are arterial spin labeling  and diffusion MRI . The latter procedure is similar to BOLD fMRI but provides contrast based on the magnitude of diffusion of water molecules in the brain. In addition to detecting BOLD responses from activity due to tasks/stimuli, fMRI can measure resting state fMRI , or taskless fMRI, which shows the subjects' baseline BOLD variance.  Since about 1998 studies have shown the existence and properties of the default mode network , aka 'Resting State Network' , a functionally connected neural network of apparent 'brain states'.	2.7977471
Cirrhosis is a disease of the liver .  Normal liver tissue is replaced by scar tissue . The liver does not work so well. Cirrhosis is caused mostly by alcoholism , hepatitis B or hepatitis C . Ascites  is the most common complication for cirrhosis. The patient's skin develops a yellowish hue  as the disease gets worse. Liver damage by cirrhosis cannot be repaired. It leads to a poor quality of life, and can cause death.	Cirrhosis , also known as liver cirrhosis or hepatic cirrhosis , and end-stage liver disease , is the impaired liver function caused by the formation of scar tissue known as fibrosis , due to damage caused by liver disease .  Damage causes tissue repair and subsequent formation of scar tissue, which over time can replace normal functioning tissue leading to the impaired liver function of cirrhosis.   The disease typically develops slowly over months or years.  Early symptoms may include tiredness , weakness , loss of appetite , unexplained weight loss , nausea and vomiting, and discomfort in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen.  As the disease worsens, symptoms may include itchiness , swelling in the lower legs , fluid build-up in the abdomen , jaundice , bruising easily , and the development of spider-like blood vessels in the skin .  The fluid build-up in the abdomen may become spontaneously infected .  More serious complications include hepatic encephalopathy , bleeding from dilated veins in the esophagus , stomach or intestines , and liver cancer .  Cirrhosis is most commonly caused by alcoholic liver disease , non-alcoholic steatohepatitis  – ,  chronic hepatitis B , and chronic hepatitis C .   Heavy drinking over a number of years can cause alcoholic liver disease.  NASH has a number of causes, including obesity , high blood pressure , abnormal levels of cholesterol , type 2 diabetes , and metabolic syndrome .  Less common causes of cirrhosis include autoimmune hepatitis , primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis that disrupt bile duct function, genetic disorders such as Wilson's disease and hereditary hemochromatosis , and chronic heart failure with liver congestion .  Diagnosis is based on blood tests , medical imaging , and liver biopsy .  	2.7922556
Halitosis is a symptom where a person has bad breath. It can be caused by bad dental care, tooth decay or gum disease .	Bad breath , also known as halitosis , is a symptom in which a noticeably unpleasant breath odour is present.  It can result in anxiety among those affected.  It is also associated with depression and symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder .  The concerns of bad breath may be divided into genuine and non-genuine cases.  Of those who have genuine bad breath, about 85% of cases come from inside the mouth.  The remaining cases are believed to be due to disorders in the nose , sinuses , throat , lungs , esophagus , or stomach .  Rarely, bad breath can be due to an underlying medical condition such as liver failure or ketoacidosis .  Non-genuine cases occur when someone feels they have bad breath but someone else cannot detect it.  This is estimated to make up between 5% and 72% of cases. 	2.7910783
Clonazepam is an anticonvulsant . This means it can be used to stop seizures . It is also used to lessen states of fear . It is an anxiolytic . It is a benzodiazepine . Benzodiazepines are very addictive . Clonazepam is used to treat certain forms of epilepsy . It is also used to treat certain disorders of sleep, such as sleepwalking . In certain cases it is used as an off-label drug in psychiatry . It is also used for panic disorders .	Clonazepam , sold under the brand Klonopin among others, is a medication used to prevent and treat seizures , panic disorder , and the movement disorder known as akathisia .  It is a tranquilizer of the benzodiazepine class.  It is taken by mouth.  Effects begin within one hour and last between six and twelve hours.  Common side effects include sleepiness, poor coordination, and agitation.  Long-term use may result in tolerance , dependence , and withdrawal symptoms if stopped abruptly.  Dependence occurs in one-third of people who take clonazepam for longer than four weeks.  There is an increased risk of suicide , particularly in people who are already depressed.   If used during pregnancy it may result in harm to the fetus.  Clonazepam binds to GABA A receptors , thus increasing the effect of the chief inhibitory neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid .  Clonazepam was patented in 1960 and went on sale in 1975 in the United States from Roche .   It is available as a generic medication .  In 2018, it was the 47th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 17 million prescriptions.   In many areas of the world it is commonly used as a recreational drug .  	2.780705
Heartburn is an uncomfortable feeling in the chest that happens when acids from the stomach travel up the esophagus . When stomach acids hurt the lining of the esophagus, the feeling is a symptom .  The burning sensation is commonly called "heartburn," but it has nothing to do with the heart .  The symptom may be helped by taking antacids , such as calcium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate . 	Heartburn , also known as pyrosis , cardialgia or acid indigestion ,  is a burning sensation in the central chest or upper central abdomen .    The discomfort often rises in the chest and may radiate to the neck, throat, or angle of the arm. Heartburn is usually due to regurgitation of gastric acid  into the esophagus and is the major symptom of gastroesophageal reflux disease .  In about 0.6% of cases it is a symptom of ischemic heart disease .  The term indigestion includes heartburn along with a number of other symptoms.  Indigestion is sometimes defined as a combination of epigastric pain and heartburn.  Heartburn is commonly used interchangeably with gastroesophageal reflux disease  rather than just to describe a symptom of burning in one's chest. 	2.771377
Coma is a medical term. It is a state of deep unconsciousness . People who are in that state cannot be woken up. They also do not react to pain or light . Coma can result from various conditions . Some of these are intoxication , poisons , damages or diseases of the nervous system . It can also be the result of certain drugs . Doctors sometimes put patients that have very bad injuries into a coma. There are different levels of coma. Comas usually do not last more than several weeks, but those several weeks could be disastrous . Sometimes only basic bodily functions are left over. Intensive hospital care is often needed to recover some of these functions. Some comas can last years, but these are usually not woken up from. The family of a coma victim  can sign papers so that they are taken off of life support and then will die .	A coma is a deep state of prolonged unconsciousness in which a person cannot be awakened, fails to respond normally to painful stimuli, light, or sound, lacks a normal wake-sleep cycle and does not initiate voluntary actions.  Coma patients exhibit a complete absence of wakefulness and are unable to consciously feel, speak or move.  Comas can be derived by natural causes, or can be medically induced . Clinically, a coma can be defined as the inability consistently to follow a one-step command.  It can also be defined as a score of ≤ 8 on the Glasgow Coma Scale  lasting ≥ 6 hours. For a patient to maintain consciousness, the components of wakefulness and awareness must be maintained. Wakefulness describes the quantitative degree of consciousness , whereas awareness relates to the qualitative aspects of the functions mediated by the cortex, including cognitive abilities such as attention, sensory perception, explicit memory, language, the execution of tasks, temporal and spatial orientation and reality judgment.   From a neurological perspective, consciousness is maintained by the activation of the cerebral cortex —the gray matter that forms the outer layer of the brain and by the reticular activating system , a structure located within the brainstem .   The term 'coma', from the Greek κῶμα koma , meaning deep sleep, had already been used in the Hippocratic corpus  and later by Galen . Subsequently, it was hardly used in the known literature up to the middle of the 17th century. The term is found again in Thomas Willis '  influential De anima brutorum , where lethargy , 'coma' , carus  and apoplexy  are mentioned. The term carus is also derived from Greek, where it can be found in the roots of several words meaning soporific or sleepy. It can still be found in the root of the term 'carotid'. Thomas Sydenham  mentioned the term 'coma' in several cases of fever .  	2.7701666

Electroconvulsive therapy , also called electroshock , is a psychiatric treatment in which seizures are caused by electricity in unconscious patients to treat llness. The process is completed by placing electrodes on the sides of the patient's head  and sending a small electric current through the brain. This lasts for about half a second. The patient is also made unconscious before the treatment for safety reasons. The therapy without informed consent is medical abuse and Article 18 of the Yogyakarta Principles prohibit to "care" any sexual orientation and gender identity though any therapy including this.	Electroconvulsive therapy  is a psychiatric treatment where a generalized seizure  is electrically induced to manage refractory mental disorders .  Typically, 70 to 120 volts are applied externally to the patient's head resulting in approximately 800 milliamperes of direct current passed through the brain, for 100 milliseconds to 6 seconds duration, either from temple to temple  or from front to back of one side of the head . The ECT procedure was first conducted in 1938 by Italian psychiatrist Ugo Cerletti  and rapidly replaced less safe and effective forms of biological treatments in use at the time. ECT is often used with informed consent  as a safe and effective intervention for major depressive disorder , mania , and catatonia .  ECT machines were originally placed in the Class III category by the United States Food and Drug Administration  in 1976.  They were re-classified as Class II devices, for treatment of catatonia, major depressive disorder, and bipolar disorder , in 2018.  Aside from effects on the brain, the general physical risks of ECT are similar to those of brief general anesthesia .  : 259 Immediately following treatment, the most common adverse effects are confusion and transient memory loss.   Among treatments for severely depressed pregnant women, ECT is one of the least harmful to the fetus . 	2.7635028
Binge eating  is a disease characterized by episodes of compulsive overeating. It has the following characteristics: The vicious cycle of binge eating It can make people feel satisfied for a while, but after that, they will feel guilty and they will regret eating so much. People overeat to feel better, but they actually feel worse, and go back to overeating for relief, forming a vicious cycle. Other characteristics: If binge eating becomes a pattern, this is an eating disorder . People who suffer from this have a high risk of weight gain . They may feel ashamed of their eating habits and become depressed . People who binge and then purge , , have a different eating disorder called bulimia . People with anorexia may also binge and purge.	Binge eating is a pattern of disordered eating which consists of episodes of uncontrollable eating. It is a common symptom of eating disorders such as binge eating disorder and bulimia nervosa . During such binges, a person rapidly consumes an excessive quantity of food.  A diagnosis of binge eating is associated with feelings of loss of control.  Binge eating disorder is also linked with overweight and obesity.  The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, or rather the DSM, is a manual that is produced by the American Psychiatric Association . In the DSM-5, which was released in 2013 by the APA, they included a disorder diagnosis criteria for Binge Eating Disorder . It is as follows:  Typical warning signs of  binge eating disorder include the disappearance of large amount of foods in relatively short periods of time. A person who may be experiencing binge eating disorder may appear to be uncomfortable when eating around others or in public.  A person may develop new and extreme eating patterns that they have never done before. These might include diets that cut out certain food groups completely such as a no dairy or no carb diet. They might also steal or hoard food in unusual places.  A person may be experiencing fluctuations in their weight. In addition they may have feelings of disgust, depression, or guilt about over eating.  Another possible warning sign of binge eating is that a person may be obsessed with their body image or weight. 	2.7621605
Hysteria is when someone has a very strong emotion that is unmanageable. Often, this means a very strong sense of fear . When someone has hysteria, it is called "hysterics". Hysteria could be caused by traumatic events in a person's life. Today, many psychiatrists and other doctors do not use the word "hysteria" for a patient. They use other words that have the same meaning. Some of the words they may use are "psychosomatic", "functional", "nonorganic", "psychogenic", or "medically unexplained". One of the conditions of hysteria may be Histrionic personality disorder .	Hysteria is a pejorative term used colloquially to mean ungovernable emotional excess and can refer to a temporary state of mind or emotion.  In the 19th century, hysteria was considered a diagnosable physical illness in females. It is assumed that the basis for diagnosis operated under the belief that women are predisposed to mental and behavioral conditions; a misinterpretation of gender-related differences in stress responses.  In the 20th century, it shifted to being considered a mental illness.  Many influential persons such as Sigmund Freud and Jean-Martin Charcot dedicated research to hysteria patients.  Currently, most doctors practicing Western medicine do not accept hysteria as a medical diagnosis.  The blanket diagnosis of hysteria has been fragmented into myriad medical categories such as epilepsy , histrionic personality disorder , conversion disorders , dissociative disorders , or other medical conditions.   Furthermore, lifestyle choices, such as deciding not to wed, are no longer considered symptoms of psychological disorders such as hysteria.  The word hysteria originates from the Greek word for uterus , hystera .  The oldest record of hysteria dates back to 1900 B.C. when Egyptians recorded behavioral abnormalities in adult women on medical papyrus.  The Egyptians attributed the behavioral disturbances to a wandering uterus—thus later dubbing the condition hysteria.  To treat hysteria Egyptian doctors prescribed various medications.  For example, doctors put strong smelling substances on the patients’ vulvas to encourage the uterus to return to its proper position.  Another tactic was to smell or swallow unsavory herbs to encourage the uterus to flee back to the lower part of the female’s abdomen. 	2.7606685
Fetoscopy is a medical procedure to examine and treat an unborn child. It is only done in specialized hospitals. Because it is difficult to do, it is only done for severe illnesses. The complication that occurs most often is that the baby is born early , or that a miscarriage occurs. This happens in up to 5% of the cases. In many cases, fetoscopy is completented or replaced by medical ultrasound .	Fetoscopy is an endoscopic procedure during pregnancy to allow surgical access to the fetus , the amniotic cavity , the umbilical cord , and the fetal side of the placenta . A small  incision is made in the abdomen , and an endoscope is inserted through the abdominal wall and uterus into the amniotic cavity. Fetoscopy allows for medical interventions such as a biopsy  or a laser occlusion of abnormal blood vessels  or the treatment of spina bifida .  Fetoscopy is usually performed in the second or third trimester of pregnancy. The procedure can place the fetus at increased risk of adverse outcomes, including fetal loss or preterm delivery, so the risks and benefits must be carefully weighed in order to protect the health of the mother and fetus. The procedure is typically performed in an operating room by an obstetrician-gynecologist . In 1945, Björn Westin published a study which documented his use of a panendoscope to directly observe embryos.  In 1966, Agüero et al published a study which used hysteroscopy to observe various features of the fetus, cervix, and uterus.  In 1972, Carlo Valenti of the SUNY Downstate Medical Center recorded a technique which he called "endoamnioscopy", which allowed for direct visualization of the developing fetus.  Gallinat made the first attempt to standardize these techniques in 1978. 	2.7540848
The relationship between a doctor and a patient is a very important part of medicine . Only when there is a good relationship between the two is it possible to have high-quality healthcare . This relationship is also at the base of medical ethics . Many medical schools teach the doctors to be to keep a professional relationship with their patients, to respect the patients' dignity and privacy . This relationship has asymmetric information though. The doctor knows more than the patient, but has to explain the patient's situation, and has to ask the patient what treatments should be done. There is a very similar relationship between the patient and nurses , psychologists . There are different legal norms that regulate this relationship. Examples of such norms are the Hippocratic oath , the Declaration of Geneva . Professional responsibility may also govern such a relationship. Ideally, patient and doctor trust each other. If they do, this can have a positive influence on the development of disease or condition. Healing can be hindered if the patient does not take the prescribed drugs , of if these drugs are not taken in the doses prescribed.	A doctor-patient relationship is a complex relationship between a doctor and a patient . This relationship is formed when a doctor attends to a patient's medical needs and is usually through consent.  This unique relationship is built on trust, respect, communication, and a common understanding of both the doctor and patients' sides. The trust aspect of this relationship goes both ways, the doctor trusts the patient to reveal any information that may be relevant to the case and in turn, the patient trusts the doctor to respect their privacy and not disclose this information to outside parties. An important dynamic of this relationship is that the doctor is bonded by oath to follow certain ethical guidelines  whereas the patient is not.   It is important to remember that the doctor–patient relationship is a central part of health care and the practice of medicine . Additionally, the healthiness of a doctor-patient relationship is essential to keep the quality of the patient's healthcare high as well as to ensure that the doctor is functioning at their optimum. In more recent times healthcare has become more patient-centered and this has brought a new dynamic to this ancient relationship. A patient must have confidence in the competence of their physician and must feel that they can confide in him or her. For most physicians, the establishment of good rapport with a patient is important.  Some medical specialties, such as psychiatry and family medicine , emphasize the physician–patient relationship more than others, such as pathology or radiology , which have very little contact with patients. The quality of the patient–physician relationship is important to both parties. The doctor and patient's values and perspectives about disease, life, and time available play a role in building up this relationship. A strong relationship between the doctor and patient may lead to frequent, freely-offered quality information about the patient's disease and as a result, better healthcare for the patient and their family. Enhancing both the accuracy of the diagnosis and the patient's knowledge about the disease contributes to a good relationship between the doctor and the patient.  In a poor doctor-patient relationship, the physician's ability to make a full assessment may be compromised and the patient may be more likely to distrust the diagnosis and proposed treatment. The downstream effects of this mistrust may include decreased patient adherence to the physician's medical advice , which could result in poorer health outcomes for the patient. In these circumstances, and also in cases where there is genuine divergence of medical opinions, a second opinion from another physician may be sought, or the patient may choose to go to another physician that they trust more. Additionally, the benefits of any placebo effect are also based upon the patient's subjective assessment  of the physician's credibility and skills. 	2.7519464
Delirium is a medical term. The condition is also known as acute confusional state . Doctors use it to describe patients who have lost parts or all of their ability to focus attention. People who suffer from it  may also have problems to concentrate, or to remember things or  other people. Delirium is a medical symptom . It is not a disease. A delirium can have many causes. The most common ones include: There are several definitions of what constitutes a delirium, but in general, the following is true: Deliria are often treated with special drugs , called antipsychotics .	Delirium , also known as acute confusional state , is the organically caused decline from a previous baseline mental functioning that develops over a short period of time, typically hours to days.   Delirium is a syndrome encompassing disturbances in attention, consciousness, and cognition. It may also involve other neurological deficits, such as psychomotor disturbances , impaired sleep-wake cycle, emotional disturbances, and perceptual disturbances , although these features are not required for diagnosis. Delirium is caused by an acute organic process , which is a physically identifiable structural, functional, or chemical problem in the brain that may arise from a disease process outside the brain that nonetheless affects the brain. It may result from an underlying disease process , side effect of a medication, withdrawal from drugs, over-consumption of alcohol , usage of hallucinogenic deliriants , or from any number of factors affecting one's overall health . In contrast, fluctuations in mental status/function due to changes in primarily psychiatric processes or diseases  do not, by definition, meet the criteria for 'delirium.'  Delirium may be difficult to diagnose without the proper establishment of a person's usual mental function. Without careful assessment and history, delirium can easily be confused with a number of psychiatric disorders or chronic organic brain syndromes because of many overlapping signs and symptoms in common with dementia , depression , psychosis , etc.  Delirium may manifest from a baseline of existing mental illness, baseline intellectual disability, or dementia, without being due to any of these problems.	2.7502444
Erotomania is a delusional disorder in which the subject has a delusion that a particular person is deeply in love with them; lack of response is rationalized, and pursuit and harassment may occur.	Erotomania is listed in the DSM-5 as a subtype of a delusional disorder .  It is a relatively uncommon paranoid condition that is characterized by an individual's delusions of another person being infatuated with them.  This disorder is most often seen  in female patients who are shy, dependent and sexually inexperienced. The object of the delusion is typically a male who is unattainable due to high social or financial status, marriage or disinterest.   The object of obsession may also be imaginary, deceased or someone the patient has never met. Delusions of reference are common, as the erotomanic individual often perceives that they are being sent messages from the secret admirer through innocuous events such as seeing license plates from specific states, but has no research development proof.  Commonly, the onset of erotomania is sudden, and the course is chronic.  Erotomania is more common in women, but men are more likely to exhibit violent and stalker -like behaviors.  The core symptom of the disorder is that the sufferer holds an unshakable belief that another person is secretly in love with them. In some cases, the sufferer may believe several people at once are "secret admirers". Most commonly, the individual has delusions of being loved by an unattainable person who is usually an acquaintance or someone the person has never met. The sufferer may also experience other types of delusions concurrently with erotomania, such as delusions of reference, wherein the perceived admirer secretly communicates their love by subtle methods such as body posture, arrangement of household objects, colors, license plates on cars from specific states, and other seemingly innocuous acts . Some delusions may be extreme such as the conception, birth, and kidnapping of children that never existed. The delusional objects may be replaced by others over time, and some may be chronic in fixed forms.  Denial is characteristic with this disorder as the patients do not accept the fact that their object of delusion may be married, unavailable, or uninterested. The phantom lover may also be imaginary or deceased. Erotomania has two forms: primary and secondary. Primary erotomania is also commonly referred to as de Clerambault's syndrome and Old Maid's Insanity  and it exists alone without comorbidities , has a sudden onset and a chronic outcome.  The secondary form is found along with mental disorders like paranoid schizophrenia, often includes persecutory delusions , hallucinations , and grandiose ideas, and has a more gradual onset.  Patients with a "fixed" condition are more seriously ill with constant delusions and are less responsive to treatment. These individuals are usually timid, dependent women that are often sexually inexperienced.  In those with a more mild, recurrent condition, delusions are shorter-lived and the disorder can exist undetected by others for years.  Problematic behaviors include actions like calling, sending letters and gifts, making unannounced house visits and other persistent stalking behaviors. 	2.748474
Anxiolytics are drugs that are used for the treatment of anxiety , and anxiety-related disorders .  The common drugs can be classified: In addition to these drug classes, there are also certain plants that have such properties. Many of the drugs listed above have side-effects . For this reason, they are only available on prescription . Certain forms of therapy have also been used to treat anxiety disorders. Anxiolytics are said to act on key biochemical messengers in the brain and eventually decrease the abnormal excitability. The biochemical messengers or binding sites are unevenly distributed in the brain, and also said to be associated with a GABA receptor and a chloride channel.  	An anxiolytic   is a medication, or other intervention, that reduces anxiety . This effect is in contrast to anxiogenic agents, which increase anxiety.  Anxiolytic medications have been used for the treatment of anxiety disorder and its related psychological and physical symptoms. Light therapy and other interventions have also been found to have an anxiolytic effect.  Beta-receptor blockers such as propranolol and oxprenolol are sometimes used to combat the somatic symptoms of anxiety such as tachycardia and palpitations . 	2.7323072
An emergency medical dispatcher is a person who answers telephone calls to the emergency medical services and sends out the ambulances . For each call they much decide if an ambulance is needed and which one should be sent. They also help the caller with their problems until the ambulance arrives.	An emergency medical dispatcher is a professional telecommunicator , tasked with the gathering of information related to medical emergencies, the provision of assistance and instructions by voice, prior to the arrival of emergency medical services , and the dispatching and support of EMS resources responding to an emergency call. The term "emergency medical dispatcher" is also a certification level and a professional designation, certified through the Association of Public-Safety Communications Officials-International   and the International Academies of Emergency Dispatch.  Many dispatchers, whether certified or not, will dispatch using a standard emergency medical dispatch protocol. Dispatchers have always played an essential role of emergency medical services . At its most basic, the role of the dispatcher has been to identify the problem and the location of the patient, and then identify an ambulance that can be sent to the location. Prior to the professionalization of emergency medical services, this step in the process was often informal; the caller would simply call the local ambulance service, the telephone call would be answered , the location and problem information would be gathered, and an ambulance assigned to complete the task. The ambulance would then complete the call, return to the station, and wait for the next telephone call. Although earlier experiments with the use of radio communication in ambulances did occur, it was not until the 1950s that the use of radio dispatch became widespread in the United States and Canada. Indeed, during the 1950s the presence of radio dispatch was often treated as marketing inducement, and was prominently displayed on the sides of ambulances, along with other technological advances, such as carrying oxygen . Dispatch methodology was often determined by the business arrangements of the ambulance company. If the ambulance were under contract to the town, it might be dispatched as an 'add-on' to the fire department or police department resources. In some cases, it might be under contract to the local hospital, and dispatched from there. In many cases, small independent ambulance companies were simply dispatched by a family member or employee, employed part-time in many cases. Ambulance dispatchers required little in the way of qualifications, apart from good telephone manners and a knowledge of the local geography.	2.720002
In September and October 2020, multiple people at the White House tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 , the virus that causes COVID-19 . On September 16, it was reported that at least one unnamed staffer had tested positive.  On October 1, President Donald Trump , his wife Melania Trump , press advisor Hope Hicks , presidential campaign manager Bill Stepien , and former White House counselor Kellyanne Conway tested positive for the coronavirus.     Claudia Conway, the daughter of Kellyanne Conway, announced on Oct 4 that she had tested positive as well.  On October 5, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany announced she had also tested positive.  Trump tested positive days after the first presidential debate against Joe Biden in Cleveland, Ohio . Around eleven people tested positive who worked at the debates in Cleveland.  Some of Trump's personal aides who prepared him for the debates also tested positive. 	The White House COVID-19 outbreak was a cluster of SARS-CoV-2 infections that began in September 2020 and ended in January 2021 that spread among people, including many U.S. government officials, who were in close contact during the COVID-19 pandemic in Washington, D.C. Numerous high-profile individuals were infected, including President Donald Trump , who was hospitalized for three days.  At least 48 White House staff members or associates, closely working with White House personnel, tested positive for the virus.    The White House resisted efforts to engage in contact tracing , leaving it unclear how many people were infected in total and what the origins of the spread were. 	2.7177968

The human microbiome  is the collection of microorganisms which live on us. They live on the skin, in the saliva and mouth, in the eyes, and in the gut and the rest of the gastrointestinal tract . They include bacteria , archaea , fungi and single- celled eukaryotes .  Everyone carries around far more of these microbes than the number of human cells in the body. The human body has about 100 trillion cells , and carries about ten times as many microorganisms in the intestines alone .     The microbiome is "the ecological community of commensal , symbiotic , and pathogenic microorganisms that literally share our body space".   The term was originally coined by Joshua Lederberg . He thought the microorganisms living in the human body in health and disease were important. Many scientific articles distinguish "microbiome" and " microbiota " to describe either the collective genomes of the microorganisms that live in an environmental niche or the microorganisms themselves, respectively.    However, by the original definitions these terms are largely synonymous . Some of these organisms are useful for humans. However, most have no known effect. They are just symbionts : they live with us. Those which are expected to be present are members of the normal flora . Under normal circumstances they do not cause disease, but may even help our health. Studies in 2009 asked whether our health is damaged if we reduce this biota.  This is certainly the case with gut flora .  Although "flora" refers to plants rather than bacteria, the term 'gut flora' is widely used and familiar to biologists. ' Biota ' refers to the total collection of organisms in an ecosystem . The term 'microbiota' is best for bacteria and other microorganisms, but no doubt 'flora' will often be used.	The human microbiome is the aggregate of all microbiota that reside on or within human tissues and biofluids along with the corresponding anatomical sites in which they reside,  including the skin, mammary glands, seminal fluid, uterus, ovarian follicles, lung, saliva, oral mucosa , conjunctiva , biliary tract , and gastrointestinal tract . Types of human microbiota include bacteria , archaea , fungi , protists and viruses . Though micro-animals can also live on the human body, they are typically excluded from this definition. In the context of genomics , the term human microbiome is sometimes used to refer to the collective genomes of resident microorganisms;  however, the term human metagenome has the same meaning.  Humans are colonized by many microorganisms, with approximately the same order of magnitude of non-human cells as human cells.  Some microorganisms that colonize humans are commensal , meaning they co-exist without harming humans; others have a mutualistic relationship with their human hosts.  : 700  Conversely, some non- pathogenic microorganisms can harm human hosts via the metabolites they produce, like trimethylamine , which the human body converts to trimethylamine N-oxide via FMO3 -mediated oxidation.   Certain microorganisms perform tasks that are known to be useful to the human host but the role of most of them is not well understood. Those that are expected to be present, and that under normal circumstances do not cause disease, are sometimes deemed normal flora or normal microbiota . 	2.710617
Depressants are a group of drugs that depress or slow down the activity of certain areas of the brain .  Functionally, depressants counter the effects of stimulants , which increase brain activity. Drugs of the depressant type are widely used around the world, as prescription drugs.  They can help with the following: Among the big groups of depressants are:	A depressant , or central depressant , is a drug that lowers neurotransmission levels, which is to depress or reduce arousal or stimulation , in various areas of the brain.  Depressants are also occasionally referred to as "downers" as they lower the level of arousal when taken. Stimulants or "uppers" increase mental and/or physical function, hence the opposite drug class of depressants is stimulants, not antidepressants . Depressants are widely used throughout the world as prescription medicines and as illicit substances . Alcohol is a very prominent depressant. Alcohol can be and is more likely to be a large problem among teenagers and young adults. When depressants are used, effects often include ataxia , anxiolysis , pain relief , sedation or somnolence , and cognitive / memory impairment , as well as in some instances euphoria , dissociation , muscle relaxation , lowered blood pressure or heart rate , respiratory depression , and anticonvulsant effects. Depressants also act to produce anesthesia . Cannabis may sometimes be considered a depressant due to one of its components, cannabidiol . The latter is known to treat insomnia, anxiety and muscle spasms similar to other depressive drugs. However, tetrahydrocannabinol , another component, may slow brain function to a small degree while reducing reaction to stimuli, it is generally considered to be a stimulant and main psychoactive agent to sometimes cause anxiety , panic and psychosis instead. Other depressants can include drugs like Xanax  and a number of opiates . Depressants exert their effects through a number of different pharmacological mechanisms, the most prominent of which include facilitation of GABA , and inhibition of glutamatergic or monoaminergic activity. Other examples are chemicals that modify the electrical signaling inside the body, the most prominent of these being bromides and body blockers .	2.7032855
A hospice is a type of medical treatment that helps take care of people who are very sick and have an illness that they will not be able to heal from. Many people staying in hospices have cancer or AIDS .  People who stay in hospices are expected to die soon, but sometimes they get better. Hospices are different from other medicinal treatments because they mostly try to make people feel better instead of trying to cure them. Hospice tries to allow people to die with as little pain as possible. Hospices have doctors , nurses , and other people who go to patients houses, nursing homes and hospitals to talk to people who want to use hospice medicine. The Hospice movement was started in England in the 1950s by a nurse named Dame Cicely Saunders.  The word Dame at the start of her name means that she did such good work starting hospices that the Queen of England made her a female knight . A different nurse named Florence Wald brought hospice medicine to the United States because she worked with Dame Cicely Saunders and liked what she did.	Hospice care is a type of health care that focuses on the palliation of a terminally ill patient's pain and symptoms and attending to their emotional and spiritual needs at the end of life. Hospice care prioritizes comfort and quality of life by reducing pain and suffering. Hospice care provides an alternative to therapies focused on life-prolonging measures that may be arduous, likely to cause more symptoms, or are not aligned with a person's goals. Hospice care in the United States is largely defined by the practices of the Medicare system and other health insurance providers, which cover inpatient or at home hospice care for patients with terminal diseases who are estimated to live six months or less. Hospice care under the Medicare Hospice Benefit requires documentation from two physicians estimating a person has less than six months to live if the disease follows its usual course. Hospice benefits include access to a multidisciplinary treatment team specialized in end of life care and can be accessed in the home, long term care facility or the hospital.  Outside the United States, the term tends to be primarily associated with the particular buildings or institutions that specialize in such care. Such institutions may similarly provide care mostly in an end-of-life setting, but they may also be available for patients with other palliative care needs. Hospice care includes assistance for patients' families to help them cope with what is happening and provide care and support to keep the patient at home. 	2.6875737
A date rape drug is a drug that is used to make a person unable to consent to sex . This makes that person likely to be a victim of rape or sexual assault .  Date rape drugs include GHB , Rohypnol , alcohol and MDMA . Another is methaqualone, also known as Quaalude.	A date rape drug is any drug that incapacitates another person and renders that person vulnerable to a sexual assault , including rape . The substances are associated with date rape because of reported incidents of their use in the context of two people dating, during which the victim is sexually assaulted or raped or suffers other harm. The substances are not exclusively used to perpetrate sexual assault or rape, but are the properties or side-effects of substances normally used for legitimate medical purposes. One of the most common incapacitating agents for date rape is alcohol , administered either surreptitiously  or consumed voluntarily,  rendering the victim unable to make informed decisions or give consent. No comprehensive data exists on the frequency of drug-facilitated sexual assaults involving the use of surreptitious drug administration, due to the report rate of assaults and because rape victims who do report are often either never tested for these drugs, are tested for the wrong ones, or the tests are administered after the drug has been metabolized and left their body.  A 1999 study of 1,179 urine specimens from victims of suspected drug-facilitated sexual assaults in 49 American states found six  positive for Rohypnol , 97  positive for other benzodiazepines, 48  positive for GHB , 451  positive for alcohol and 468  negative for any of the drugs searched for.  A similar study of 2,003 urine samples of victims of suspected drug-facilitated sexual assaults found less than 2% tested positive for Rohypnol or GHB.  The samples used in these studies could only be verified as having been submitted within a 72-hour time frame or a 48-hour time frame.	2.6762328
Vomiting , also called puking , is emptying the contents of stomach through mouth . It can be either food or liquid in the stomach. It can be from infection , contaminated food or drink , foul smells or foul-tasting food, the brain being injured, a block in the small intestines so food and liquid cannot go through, too much alcohol or other drugs. Also, people can make themselves vomit  which is called purging . Usually people who have eaten or drunk poison are made to vomit any residual  poison off. Excessive vomiting may lead to dehydration , which can be dangerous, if not fatal as it will shut down a person's organs and twist the intestines.	Vomiting  is the involuntary, forceful expulsion of the contents of one's stomach through the mouth and sometimes the nose .  Vomiting can be caused by many conditions; it may be present as a specific response to ailments like gastritis  or poisoning , or as a non-specific sequela ranging from brain tumors and elevated intracranial pressure to overexposure to ionizing radiation . The feeling that one is about to vomit is called nausea ; it often precedes, but does not always lead to vomiting. Antiemetics are sometimes necessary to suppress nausea and vomiting. In severe cases, where dehydration develops, intravenous fluid may be required. Self-induced vomiting can be a component of an eating disorder such as bulimia , and is itself now classified as an eating disorder on its own, purging disorder . 	2.66266
In medicine , people talk about complications if a disease or condition a patient has gets worse. This makes it more difficult  to treat.	Complication or complications may refer to:	2.6493118
In medicine , malignant is a clinical word that is used to describe an illness that kills a patient fast. A malignant tumor is a tumor that is able to invade nearby tissues and spread to tissues that are not nearby.  Not all patients diagnosed with malignant tumors die, because of the improved treatments available.  The actual prognosis depends on the type of tumor, its differentiation, and how bad the disease is.  The term malignant is typically applied to neoplasms that show aggressive behavior characterized by local invasion or distant metastasis .	Malignancy  is the tendency of a medical condition to become progressively worse. Malignancy is most familiar as a characterization of cancer . A malignant tumor contrasts with a non-cancerous benign tumor in that a malignancy is not self-limited in its growth, is capable of invading into adjacent tissues, and may be capable of spreading to distant tissues. A benign tumor has none of those properties. Malignancy in cancers is characterized by anaplasia , invasiveness, and metastasis .  Malignant tumors are also characterized by genome instability , so that cancers, as assessed by whole genome sequencing , frequently have between 10,000 and 100,000 mutations in their entire genomes.  Cancers usually show tumour heterogeneity , containing multiple subclones.  They also frequently have reduced expression of DNA repair enzymes due to epigenetic methylation of DNA repair genes or altered microRNAs that control DNA repair gene expression.	2.642668
In medicine , saline refers to any solution of salt in water ; that is, salt water . Such solutions are sterile when they are to be placed into the body by infusion or injection . If the solution has more salt in it than is found in the human body, it is called hypertonic saline . The normal salt level is 0.9% and any salt amount more than 0.9% is called hypertonic.	Saline  is a mixture of sodium chloride in water and has a number of uses in medicine.  Applied to the affected area it is used to clean wounds, help remove contact lenses , and help with dry eyes .  By injection into a vein it is used to treat dehydration such as from gastroenteritis and diabetic ketoacidosis .   Large amounts may result in fluid overload , swelling , acidosis , and high blood sodium .   In those with long-standing low blood sodium , excessive use may result in osmotic demyelination syndrome .  Saline is in the crystalloid family of medications.  It is most commonly used as a sterile 9 g of salt per litre  solution, known as normal saline.  Higher and lower concentrations may also occasionally be used.   Saline is acidic, with a pH of 5.5 . 	2.6393926
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic spread to the United Kingdom in late January 2020. By 13 May there had been  229,705 confirmed cases  and  33,186 deaths overall.  More than 90% of those dying had underlying illnesses or were over 60 years old. The infection rate was higher in care homes than in the community. There were large regional difference in the outbreak's severity. The outbreak in London had the highest total number and the most infections. England and Wales were the UK countries with the highest recorded death rate per head, and Northern Ireland had the lowest. The Department of Health and Social Care created a public health campaign to help slow the virus's spread, and began posting daily updates in early February. In February, the Heath Secretary , Matt Hancock , proposed the Health Protection  Regulations 2020 . Hospitals set up drive-through screening . The Chief Medical Officer for England, Chris Whitty , created a four-stage strategy to tackle the outbreak: contain, delay, research and mitigate .

Physiotherapy is also called "physical therapy". It attempts to treat what limits a person's abilities to move and do things in their daily life.  It is the treatment of disease, injury, deformity or disability to improve the quality of life. Physiotherapists use exercise, hands-on technique, patient education and various modalities. Physiotherapy plays an important role in the recovery of stroke patients. It also plays a major role in treating children with cerebral palsy , and in cardiopulmonary rehabilitation . Physiotherapy has three main categories which are orthopedics , neurophysiotherapy , and cardiorespiratory physiotherapy . Sports physiotherapists specialise in the strains and injuries caused to sportspeople.	Physical therapy , also known as physiotherapy , is one of the healthcare professions .  Physical therapy is provided by physical therapists who promote, maintain, or restore health through physical examination , diagnosis , prognosis, patient education , physical intervention, rehabilitation, disease prevention and health promotion . Physical therapists are known as physiotherapists in many countries. In addition to clinical practice, other aspects of physical therapist practice include research, education, consultation and health administration . Physical therapy is provided as a primary care treatment or alongside, or in conjunction with, other medical services. In some jurisdictions, such as the United Kingdom, physical therapists have the authority to prescribe medication. 	2.6329746
Analgetics   is a word for some drugs that are used to stop pain .  These are also known as painkillers .  There are several kinds of painkillers. All act on the nervous system . Some painkillers  can make people addicted if they are taken for a long time. Some painkillers have side effects that can harm people when they take too much 	An analgesic or painkiller is any member of the group of drugs used to achieve analgesia, relief from pain . They are distinct from anesthetics , which temporarily affect, and in some instances completely eliminate, sensation . Analgesic choice is also determined by the type of pain: For neuropathic pain , traditional analgesics are less effective, and there is often benefit from classes of drugs that are not normally considered analgesics, such as tricyclic antidepressants and anticonvulsants .  Analgesics are typically classified based on their mechanism of action. 	2.6301694
Defibrillation is the act of defibrillating the heart to treat the heart when it is not pushing blood because the heart muscle is not working in any pattern. Electricity causes a muscle to contract, this is how nerves cause muscles to work. The heart is a large muscle, and certain parts need to contract before other parts in order to push blood through the heart and out to the rest of body correctly. Sometimes the heart muscle doesn't contract in the correct way or at the correct speed, this is called an arrhythmia . Fibrillation is a type of arrhythmia when the whole heart is quivering, not organized to make heart beats of any kind.  CPR  can get blood to the body when the heart is fibrillating, but the heart still needs to be restarted. Sometimes CPR will do that as well, but often a defibrillator is needed. Defibrillation is done with a defibrillator. Defibrillation works by carefully sending a strong electric current to the heart, which resets the heart, and hopefully returns a normal, coordinated heart rhythm. It needs to depolarise  from a large part of the heart muscle, which stops the arrhythmia and allows the normal heartbeat to return. Defibrillators can work outside the body with the use of an external defibrillator or an automated external defibrillator , or inside the body with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator . The first use of the technique on a human was in 1947 by Claude Beck, a professor of surgery at Case Western Reserve University. The patient was a 14-year-old boy named Mickey.  Defibrillation is now used during open heart surgery, when the heart is stopped on purpose. In1980 the first implanted defibrillator was put into a patient. Implanted defibrillators are put into the chests of people at risk of going into fibrillation.  Not all arrhythmias need defibrillation. Some arrhythmias still push blood to the body, not well, but still enough to keep a person alive. Other types, like ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia , will cause a person to die within minutes unless treated. These are what need to be treated by defibrillation.	Defibrillation is a treatment for life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias , specifically ventricular fibrillation  and non-perfusing ventricular tachycardia .   A defibrillator delivers a dose of electric current  to the heart . Although not fully understood, this process depolarizes a large amount of the heart muscle , ending the dysrhythmia. Subsequently, the body's natural pacemaker in the sinoatrial node of the heart is able to re-establish normal sinus rhythm .  A heart which is in asystole  cannot be restarted by a defibrillator, but would be treated by cardiopulmonary resuscitation . In contrast to defibrillation, synchronized electrical cardioversion is an electrical shock delivered in synchrony to the cardiac cycle .  Although the person may still be critically ill , cardioversion normally aims to end poorly perfusing cardiac dysrhythmias , such as supraventricular tachycardia .   Defibrillators can be external, transvenous, or implanted , depending on the type of device used or needed.  Some external units, known as automated external defibrillators , automate the diagnosis of treatable rhythms, meaning that lay responders or bystanders are able to use them successfully with little or no training. 	2.6300871
A pharmacy is a shop where therapeutic drugs are sold. Sometimes a pharmacy is also called a drug store or chemist and druggist store . The people working in a pharmacy are called pharmacists , druggist or chemists . These people can recognise simple diseases and formulate or dispense drugs for some of them. Certain drugs are special, because they can be addictive , or they change the way other drugs act, or they need to be taken in a special way. These drugs cannot simply be bought at a pharmacy. A prescription is necessary to get them. Medical doctors give out prescriptions, which can then be used to get the drug. Many pharmacies do not sell drugs only. They also sell beauty products and hygiene -related products, like tampons for women and contraceptives . Pharmacy is also a branch of chemistry that studies the molecular structure of drugs to find better drugs.	Pharmacy is the clinical health science that links medical science with chemistry and it is charged with the discovery, production, disposal, safe and effective use, and control of medications and drugs . The practice of pharmacy requires excellent knowledge of drugs, their mechanism of action , side effects , interactions, mobility and toxicity . At the same time, it requires knowledge of treatment and understanding of the pathological process. Some specialties of pharmacists, such as that of clinical pharmacists , require other skills, e.g. knowledge about the acquisition and evaluation of physical and laboratory data.  The scope of pharmacy practice includes more traditional roles such as compounding and dispensing of medications, and it also includes more modern services related to health care , including clinical services, reviewing medications for safety and efficacy, and providing drug information. Pharmacists , therefore, are the experts on drug therapy and are the primary health professionals who optimize the use of medication for the benefit of the patients. An establishment in which pharmacy  is practiced is called a pharmacy  or a chemist's   . In the United States and Canada, drugstores commonly sell medicines , as well as miscellaneous items such as confectionery , cosmetics , office supplies , toys , hair care products and magazines and occasionally refreshments and groceries.	2.621379
Cryotherapy is using a freezing chamber  to help muscles recover. Cyrotherapy is said to multiple applications. The word "Cryo" comes from Greek language, which means icy or cold. Cryotherapy is a procedure that exposes the body to temperatures colder than -200 degrees for about 3 minutes.  The practice is said to have originated in Japan in late 1970s when a Japanese rheumatologist used cold temperatures to treat his patients painful joints.  Cryotherapy is also used to treat cancer, wherein, extreme coldtemperatures destroy cancer cells. 	Cryotherapy , sometimes known as cold therapy , is the local or general use of low temperatures in medical therapy . Cryotherapy may be used to treat a variety of tissue lesions .  The most prominent use of the term refers to the surgical treatment, specifically known as cryosurgery or cryoablation . Cryosurgery is the application of extremely low temperatures to destroy abnormal or diseased tissue and is used most commonly to treat skin conditions. Cryotherapy is used in an effort to relieve muscle pain, sprains and swelling after soft tissue damage or surgery. It is commonly used to accelerate recovery in athletes post exercise for decades. Scientifically, cryotherapy decreases the temperature of tissue surface to minimize hypoxic cell death, edema accumulation, and muscle spasms, all of which ultimately alleviate discomfort and inflammation.  It can be a range of treatments from the application of ice packs or immersion in ice baths , to the use of cold chambers. While cryotherapy is widely used, there is little evidence as to its efficacy that has been replicated or shown in large controlled studies. Its long term side effects have also not been studied.   However, there is a study that concludes that cryotherapy has a positive impact on the short-term recovery of athletes. Cryotherapy help manage muscle soreness and facilitate recovery within the first 24 hours following a sport-related activity. Athletes who use cryotherapy within the first 24 hours to alleviate pain recovered at a faster rate than athletes who did not use cryotherapy after their sport-related activity. 	2.6099348
A Mobile Army Surgical Hospital  was a medical center used during wars , to care and fix injured soldiers who got hurt in the fighting. They were an alternative to field hospitals and real hospitals which were used in World War II . During the Korean War , thanks to these kinds of hospitals, soldiers had a 97% chance of surviving an injury. They were also used in the Vietnam War and the first Gulf War , but were gradually replaced by Combat Support Hospitals or CSHs which are used today. Many people know about these places due to a well-known movie and later TV show called M*A*S*H , which was set was a hospital like this during the Korean War .	The Mobile Army Surgical Hospital  refers to a United States Army medical unit serving as a fully functional hospital in a combat area of operations.  The units were first established in August 1945, and were deployed during the Korean War and later conflicts. The term was made famous in the novel, movie, and television series M*A*S*H , which depicted a fictional MASH unit. The U.S. Army deactivated the last MASH unit on February 16, 2006. The successor to the Mobile Army Surgical Hospital is the Combat Support Hospital . A precursor to MASH units, the American Expeditionary Force Mobile Hospital No.1 was established following the example of the French military automobile-chirurgical units shortly after the American entry to the war.  Principles for a mobile medical unit and their implementation were established through trial and error in the dental field during World War II by Major Vincent P. Marran, medic in Patton's Third Army.  The effectiveness of his efforts were widely admired and supported by the command structure, but no formal designation was established.	2.6034148
Amputation is the act of cutting off a part of the human body , sometimes because of medical reasons. In some countries, amputation of the hands, feet or other body parts was used as a form of punishment for people who committed crimes . A person who has had an arm or leg removed is known as an amputee.	Physical medicine and rehabilitation Amputation is the removal of a limb by trauma , medical illness , or surgery . As a surgical measure, it is used to control pain or a disease process in the affected limb, such as malignancy or gangrene . In some cases, it is carried out on individuals as a preventive surgery for such problems. A special case is that of congenital amputation , a congenital disorder , where fetal limbs have been cut off by constrictive bands. In some countries, such as the United States   and Iran,  amputation was proposed, was formerly used, or is currently used to punish people who committed crimes.    Amputation has also been used as a tactic in war and acts of terrorism; it may also occur as a war injury. In some cultures and religions, minor amputations or mutilations are considered a ritual accomplishment.    When done by a person, the person executing the amputation is an amputator.  The amputated person is called an amputee. 	2.6032717
An emergency medical technician  is someone who works on an ambulance and takes care of sick and hurt people. EMTs used to be called "ambulance drivers," since much of their work is bringing people to an emergency room . Their other main duty is first aid including:  In the United States, each state decides what their EMTs can do. EMTs in every state are allowed to perform first aid. Each state has different rules for exactly what their EMTs can do. These rules are called treatment protocols . For example:	An emergency medical technician , also known as an ambulance technician , is a health professional that provides emergency medical services .   EMTs are most commonly found working in ambulances . In English-speaking countries, paramedics are a separate profession that has additional educational requirements, qualifications, and scope of practice.   EMTs are often employed by private ambulance services, municipal EMS agencies, governments , hospitals , and fire departments . Some EMTs are paid employees, while others  are volunteers .  EMTs provide medical care under a set of protocols, which are typically written by a physician .   EMTs are exposed to a variety of hazards such as lifting patients and equipment, treating those with infectious disease, handling hazardous substances, and transportation via ground or air vehicles. Employers can prevent occupational illness or injury by providing safe patient handling equipment, implementing a training program to educate EMTs on job hazards, and supplying PPE such as respirators, gloves, and isolation gowns when dealing with biological hazards. 	2.6005757
In psychology , anhedonia  is not being able to feel pleasure . This may include not enjoying things like eating, exercise, watching movies, meeting friends, social activities, or sexual interaction and activity. In most cases, anhedonia is caused by mental disorders . It happens in some severe cases of depression and it is a common symptom of schizophrenia , schizoid personality disorder and major depressive disorder .	Anhedonia is a diverse array of deficits in hedonic function, including reduced motivation or ability to experience pleasure.  While earlier definitions emphasized the inability to experience pleasure, anhedonia is currently used by researchers to refer to reduced motivation, reduced anticipatory pleasure , reduced consummatory pleasure , and deficits in reinforcement learning.    In the DSM-5 , anhedonia is a component of depressive disorders, substance-related disorders, psychotic disorders, and personality disorders, where it is defined by either a reduced ability to experience pleasure, or a diminished interest in engaging in pleasurable activities.   While the ICD-10 does not explicitly mention anhedonia, the depressive symptom analogous to anhedonia as described in the DSM-V is a loss of interest or pleasure.  While anhedonia was originally defined in 1896 by Théodule-Armand Ribot as the reduced ability to experience pleasure, it has been used to refer to deficits in multiple facets of reward.  Re-conceptualizations of anhedonia highlight the independence of "wanting" and "liking".  "Wanting" is a component of anticipatory positive affect, mediating both the motivation  to engage with reward, as well as the positive emotions associated with anticipating a reward.  "Liking", on the other hand, is associated with the pleasure derived from consuming a reward.   The consciousness of reward-related processes has also been used to categorize reward in the context of anhedonia, as studies comparing implicit behavior versus explicit self-reports demonstrate a dissociation of the two.  Learning has also been proposed as an independent facet of reward that may be impaired in conditions associated with anhedonia, but empirical evidence dissociating learning from either "liking" or "wanting" is lacking. 	2.5951176
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a larger effect more than the disease itself. As the SARS-CoV-2 virus has spread around the globe, many people have begun to think about the economic effects such as the decreased business and unemployment.  The pandemic caused the largest global recession in history , with more than a third of the global population at the time being placed on lockdown .  Supply shortages were expected to affect a number of sectors due to panic buying , increased usage of goods to during the pandemic, and people raising up prices on needed products such as masks, toilet paper, plastic gloves and hand sanitizer .  Reports of lack of food or groceries were said.    The pandemic also caused many social events to be pushed back such as concert delays and movie release dates. Many movie theaters are being put out of business. There was an increase in gleaning , meaning people going to farms to pick up food plants left over on the ground after a harvest.  Because restaurants and other food businesses canceled their orders, farmers had more extra crops than usual.  People formed new organizations to find farmers with extra food, organize people to collect it, and transport it to food banks and other places where people could get to it.  Global stock markets fell on 24 February 2020 due to a significant rise in the number of COVID-19 cases outside mainland China.   By 28 February 2020, stock markets worldwide saw their largest single-week declines since the 2008 financial crisis .    Global stock markets crashed in March 2020 .

In dermatology , an abrasion is a damage to the skin that affects only the surface, generally not deeper than the epidermis . But it can give mild bleeding. Mild abrasions, also known as 'grazes' do not scar , but deep abrasions may lead to the development of scarring tissue. Abrasion injuries occur rather often when exposed skin comes into moving contact with a rough surface causing trauma to the upper layers of the epidermis. Such injuries , where caused by abrasive contact with textiles or carpet , are sometimes referred to as ' rug burn' or ' carpet burn' .	Abrasion may refer to:	2.591855
Assisted suicide is when somebody who wants to commit suicide  is helped to do this by someone else.  Normally, people who ask for assisted suicide are very ill and in a lot of pain, so they want someone to help them to die, for example by being given access to drugs which will kill them. Some people prefer the terms aid in dying or death with dignity to describe assisted suicide. The term euthanasia is sometimes used, although euthanasia is generally regarded as different to assisted suicide, as it involves causing a person to die rather than helping them to kill themselves. The law about this varies a lot in different countries.  In Belgium , the Netherlands , Switzerland and in three American states it is legal to help someone to die in these circumstances.  However, in many countries it is not allowed, and the person who helps someone to die may be arrested and sent to prison . Some people who are very ill and want to die may go to these countries, such as Switzerland, in order to end their life.	Assisted suicide , also known as assisted dying or medical aid in dying , is suicide undertaken with the aid of another person.  The term usually refers to physician-assisted suicide , which is suicide that is assisted by a physician or other healthcare provider. Once it is determined that the person's situation qualifies under the physician-assisted suicide laws for that place, the physician's assistance is usually limited to writing a prescription for a lethal dose of drugs. In many jurisdictions, helping a person die by suicide is a crime .  People who support legalizing physician-assisted suicide want the people who assist in a voluntary death to be exempt from criminal prosecution for manslaughter or similar crimes. Physician-assisted suicide is legal in some countries, under certain circumstances, including Canada , Belgium , the Netherlands , Luxembourg , Spain , Switzerland , Germany , parts of the United States  and Australia . The Constitutional Court of Austria and Colombia legalized assisted suicide, but their governments have not legislated or regulated the practice yet. New Zealand legalized assisted suicide in a referendum in 2020 , but it will come into force on 6 November 2021. The parliament of Portugal passed the legalization of assisted suicide, but is now under consideration of the Constitutional Court.	2.5820158
A bat-borne virus is a virus that is transmitted through bats . Bats are vectors for these viruses, they  transmit them either through their saliva , or through their feces . Known examples of bat-borne viruses are the coronaviruses , the Ebola virus , and some forms of rabies . Many bats live in groups, which remain close to each other for a long time. It is believed that this habit helps the spread of infections . Because of their ability to fly, bats also spread the viruses in a larger area than rodents do.	Bat virome refers to the group of viruses associated with bats . Bats host a diverse array of viruses, including all seven types described by the Baltimore classification system :  double-stranded DNA viruses ;  single-stranded DNA viruses ;  double-stranded RNA viruses ;  positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses ;  negative-sense single-stranded RNA viruses ;  positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses that replicate through a DNA intermediate ; and  double-stranded DNA viruses that replicate through a single-stranded RNA intermediate . The greatest share of bat-associated viruses identified as of 2020 are of type IV, in the family Coronaviridae . Bats harbor several viruses that are zoonotic , or capable of infecting humans, and some bat-borne viruses are considered important emerging viruses .   These zoonotic viruses include the rabies virus , SARS-CoV , MERS-CoV , Marburg virus , Nipah virus , and Hendra virus . While research clearly indicates that SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats,  it is unknown how it was transmitted to humans, or if an intermediate host was involved. It has been speculated that bats may have a role in the ecology of the Ebola virus, though this is unconfirmed. While transmission of rabies from bats to humans usually occurs via biting, most other zoonotic bat viruses are transmitted by direct contact with infected bat fluids like urine, guano , or saliva, or through contact with an infected, non-bat intermediate host . There is no firm evidence that butchering or consuming bat meat can lead to viral transmission, though this has been speculated.	2.5696304
In biology , a bolus , is a ball-shaped living thing. In medicine , a bolus is a large amount of a drug given to patients to raise the blood level before treatment. A bolus can also refer to a ball of food after it has been chewed . It passes down the oesophagus by peristalsis .	Bolus may refer to:	2.5694287
A migraine is a medical condition which usually causes a pounding, throbbing headache on one side of the head. The pain may be very bad and hurt so much that a person may have a hard time doing anything. While most people who have migraines get a headache, not everyone does. There are different kinds of migraines, and some do not cause a headache but do have other symptoms . Most migraines cause a headache and nausea and might make the person dizzy or very sensitive to bright lights or loud noises. Some people have " auras " before a migraine starts, which means their ability to see becomes different. They may see funny patterns, have blurry vision, or may not be able to see at all. Other senses can change before or during a migraine, and the person may sense funny smells or tastes. Migraines can last a long time. Migraines usually last between four and 72 hours. Migraines have been classified, based on how often they happen in a month: If a person has a headache for less than fifteen days, the migraine is called episodic migraine .  If it happens more than fifteen days, it is called chronic migraine . Chronic means it happens over a long amount of time. Some people who start off getting episodic migraines may start to get chronic migraines later. Chronic migraine then may revert or go back to episodic migraine. Scientists have discovered that something called CGRP is the cause of migraines. CGRP stands for "calcitonin gene-related peptide". CGRP is a protein that causes migraines when it is released around the brain. What CGRP does, is that it causes a lot of inflammation in the meninges , a covering above the brain.	Migraine    is a primary headache disorder characterized by recurrent headaches that are moderate to severe.  Typically, episodes affect one side of the head, are pulsating in nature, and last from a few hours to three days.  Associated symptoms may include nausea , vomiting , and sensitivity to light , sound , or smell .  The pain is generally made worse by physical activity,  although regular exercise may have prophylactic effects.  Up to one-third of people affected have aura : typically a short period of visual disturbance that signals that the headache will soon occur.  Occasionally, aura can occur with little or no headache following, but not everyone has this symptom.  Migraine is believed to be due to a mixture of environmental and genetic factors.  About two-thirds of cases run in families.  Changing hormone levels may also play a role, as migraine affects slightly more boys than girls before puberty and two to three times more women than men.   The risk of migraine usually decreases during pregnancy and after menopause .   The underlying mechanisms are not fully known.  They are, however, believed to involve the nerves and blood vessels of the brain. 	2.558589
Brett E. Crozier is an American naval officer. When he was captain of the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt , he noticed that some of his crew had caught COVID-19 , a serious disease that affects the lungs and breathing.  Late in March, 2020, he wrote letters asking for permission to send his sick sailors off his ship to Guam .  These letters were found and printed in a newspaper.  A few days later, the Navy fired Crozier as the captain of the Theodore Roosevelt but did not fire him from the Navy entirely.    In late April, some leaders in the Navy asked that Crozier be reinstated and sent back as captain of the Theodore Roosevelt .  Brett Crozier is from Santa Rosa , California .  He graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1992 and became a pilot for the Navy in 1994.  He fought in Iraq in 2003.  He later earned a Master's Degree in National Security and Strategic Studies at the Naval War College .  He served in many different positions in the Navy, including Executive Officer of the USS Ronald Reagan .  Brett Crozier was captain of the USS Blue Ridge from June 2017 to November 2018.  He wrote more than twenty copies of a four-page letter, dated March 30, 2020.  He addressed it to senior officials in the military.  He asked for permission to send 1000 of his crew off the ship.  The ship had more than 4000 people on it.  Someone found his messages and they were printed in the newspaper San Francisco Chronicle on March 31, 2020.	Brett Elliott Crozier  is a captain in the United States Navy . A United States Naval Academy graduate, he became a naval aviator , first flying helicopters and then switching to fighters. After completing naval nuclear training, he served as an officer on several aircraft carriers. In spring 2020, he was commanding officer of the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt when the coronavirus disease broke out among the crew .  He was relieved of command by then-acting Secretary of the Navy Thomas Modly after sending a letter to Navy leaders asking that most of the crew be taken ashore which was subsequently leaked to the press.    Crozier himself was later diagnosed with the virus. Brett Elliott Crozier  grew up in Santa Rosa, California . He graduated from Santa Rosa High School in 1988 and then entered the United States Naval Academy .  He graduated from the Academy in 1992.

A dietitian or dietician is an expert in food and nutrition . Dietitians help promote good health through proper eating. They often write custom diets for people. In a medical setting they can give food supplements for those people who cannot get what they need because of swallowing problems. Dietitians want to find, cook and serve tasty, attractive and healthy food to patients, their families and healthcare providers.  In many countries only people with specific degrees or certifications can call themselves dietitians.  The term nutritionist is widely used as it is not controlled like the title dietitian, but the word nutritionist can be used without having the qualifications of registered dietitians. A nutritionist is not a dietitian as he is not registered to a national board and does not have the same qualifications.  Dietitians are important in the medical multidisciplinary team because they are experts in nutrition and can give advice to doctors , nurses , and other health care workers.  Dietitians supervise the preparation and service of food, help in research, and teach people on how to eat well.	A dietitian , medical dietitian , or dietician  is an expert in identifying and treating disease-related malnutrition and in conducting medical nutrition therapy , for example designing an enteral tube feeding regimen or mitigating the effects of cancer cachexia . Many dietitians work in hospitals and usually see specific patients where a nutritional assessment and intervention has been requested by a doctor or nurse, for example if a patient has lost their ability to swallow or requires artificial nutrition due to intestinal failure. Dietitians are the only regulated healthcare professionals licensed to assess, diagnose, and treat such problems. In the United Kingdom, dietitian is a 'protected title', meaning identifying yourself as a dietitian without appropriate education and registration is prohibited by law.    A registered dietitian   or registered dietitian nutritionist      meets all of a set of special academic and professional requirements, including the completion of a bachelor's and/or master's degree in nutrition and dietetics . 1 or more internships  or clinical placements  must also be completed. These may be allocated and monitored by the university as part of the structured degree programme  or may be applied for separately . Roughly half of all RDs hold graduate degrees  and many have certifications in specialized fields such as nutrition support, sports, paediatrics, renal, oncological, food-allergy, or gerontological nutrition. Although assessment priorities differ depending on the specialist area, a patient's medical and surgical history, biochemistry, diet history, eating and exercise habits usually form the basis of assessment. The RD negotiates a treatment plan with the patient which may include prescriptions, and follow-up visits often focus on maintenance and monitoring progress.	2.5422873
Depression is a state of low mood and not wanting to do anything. It can change what a person thinks, does, feels, and sense of well-being. It may lead to being sad, make it harder to think and a large change in appetite and time spent sleeping. People who have depression may feel no hope and, sometimes, thoughts of suicide . It can either be short term or long term.  The main symptom of depression is said to be anhedonia , which means losing of interest in things that usually make people happy.  Depressed mood is a symptom of some mood disorders such as major depressive disorder or dysthymia ;  it is a normal reaction to life events, such as losing a loved one; and it is also caused by some physical diseases and a side effect of some drugs and medical treatments.	Depression is a state of low mood and aversion to activity.  It can affect a person's thoughts, behavior, motivation, feelings , and sense of well-being .  The core symptom of depression is said to be anhedonia , which refers to loss of interest or a loss of feeling of pleasure in certain activities that usually bring joy to people.  Depressed mood is a symptom of some mood disorders such as major depressive disorder or dysthymia ;  it is a normal temporary reaction to life events, such as the loss of a loved one; and it is also a symptom of some physical diseases and a side effect of some drugs and medical treatments. It may feature sadness, difficulty in thinking and concentration and a significant increase or decrease in appetite and time spent sleeping. People experiencing depression may have feelings of dejection, hopelessness and, sometimes, suicidal thoughts. It can either be short term or long term.	2.5347264
A very important number for describing whether a disease can become an epidemic or not is R 0 , pronounced "R naught" or "R zero". It refers to how many people a person who has this disease is expected to infect on average. It is an abbreviation for basic reproduction number . If R 0 > 1, a disease can become an epidemic. If R 0 < 1, it cannot. Many known diseases have R 0 < 1 and cannot become epidemics. If they occur only occasionally, they are called sporadic. When there is a steady level of regular cases occurring in a region, the disease is called endemic. Doctors can use vaccines to make enough people immune in a population to stop epidemics from happening. We can also use other measures to make the effective reproduction rate  lower than the basic reproduction rate . An example of a vaccine that works really well is the smallpox vaccine, which stopped smallpox virus from spreading so well that it no longer exists except in laboratories. Examples of making the effective reproduction rate lower than the basic reproduction rate are using condoms to stop sexually transmitted diseases from spreading or not getting close to others  to stop respiratory diseases from spreading.	 In epidemiology , the basic reproduction number , or basic reproductive number , denoted R 0 {\displaystyle R_{0}} ,  of an infection is the expected number of cases directly generated by one case in a population where all individuals are susceptible to infection.  The definition assumes that no other individuals are infected or immunized . Some definitions, such as that of the Australian Department of Health , add the absence of "any deliberate intervention in disease transmission".  The basic reproduction number is not the same as the effective reproduction number R {\displaystyle R} ,  which is the number of cases generated in the current state of a population, which does not have to be the uninfected state. R 0 {\displaystyle R_{0}} is a dimensionless number and not a rate, which would have units of time −1 ,  or units of time like doubling time . 	2.523407
Automatic behaviour is the name for a set of actions that occur , without conscious thought. Usually, they are guided by a part of the nervous system that is called autonomic nervous system , or visceral nervous system. Automatic behaviour is like a reflex . Many mental illnesses have certain forms of unwanted automatic behaviour.	Automatic behavior , from the Greek automatos or self-acting, is the spontaneous production of often purposeless verbal or motor behavior without conscious self-control or self-censorship . This condition can be observed in a variety of contexts, including schizophrenia , psychogenic fugue , epilepsy , narcolepsy or in response to a traumatic event . The individual does not recall the behavior. According to the book 'The Mind Machine' by Colin Blakemore , hypoglycemia usually leads quickly to unconsciousness, but as blood glucose level falls, there is 'a window of experience between sanity and coma in which self-control is lost', and the body 'behaves on its own'. Automatic behavior can also be exhibited whilst in the REM state—subjects can hold conversations, sit up and even open their eyes. Those acts are considered sub-conscious as most of the time the events cannot be recalled by the subject. It is most common when the subject has had under 10 hours sleep within a 36-hour period. 	2.5223897
The opioid crisis or opioid pandemic is the problems with opioid drugs .  Too many people became addicted to opioids.  The crisis started in the United States in the 1990s.  Since then, about 450,000 people have died from opioids in the United States. Most of the people who died took opioids as regular drugs and became addicted. Only a small number of people used the drugs illegally. According to the United States Centers for Disease Control, the opioid crisis costs $78.5 billion a year in the United States alone.  Opioids are moderately strong, to strong painkillers . Despite the high risks, associated with addiction and overdose, they are relatively easy to get. Opioids can have sedative properties. They are useful for treating actute pain;  but they are not as effective when treating chronic pain.  When looking at chronic pain, the risks often outweigh the benefits.  In 1996, the company Purdue Pharma wanted to sell a number of drugs containing opioids.  They told doctors that patients would probably not become addicted, so the doctors prescribed opioids to many patients, even if they did not really need them.  Many of those patients became addicted.  In 2007, Purdue Pharma was fined $635 million.  The judge said this was because Purdue Pharma did not warn customers about the side effects enough. Since then, there have been other similar lawsuits .	The Opioid epidemic , also referred to as the opioid crisis , is the phrase used to describe the overuse, misuse/abuse, and overdose deaths, attributed either in part or in whole, by the class of drugs opiates/ opioids , and the significant medical, social, psychological, and economic consequences of both the medical and the non-medical or recreational use of these medications. Opioids are a diverse class of moderate to strong painkillers , including oxycodone , hydrocodone  and a very strong painkiller, fentanyl , which is synthesized to resemble other opiates such as opium -derived morphine and heroin .  The potency and availability of these substances, despite the potential risk of addiction and overdose, have made them popular both as medical treatments and as recreational drugs . Due to their sedative effects on the part of the brain which regulates breathing, the respiratory center of the medulla oblongata , opioids in high doses present the potential for respiratory depression and may cause respiratory failure and death . 	2.5052478
A birth defect  is a defect in a baby at birth, or which develop in the first month of life.  It is neutral as to whether the cause is genetic  or environmental . If a condition is said to be "congenital", that is neutral language. Often it is not known what causes a condition found at birth. In common use, it is often redirected to "birth defect". That term is also neutral as to cause. There are two main types of congenital defect. The first is caused by genetic abnormalities , which are hereditary . The second may be caused by conditions  which a baby may get.  However, we may not know what caused the condition. Sometimes doctors may find out that a baby has a congenital disorder before its birth. They use prenatal diagnosis and screening tests, such as amniocentesis .  Some gene alleles  can damage the baby.	A birth defect , also known as a congenital disorder , is a condition present at birth regardless of its cause.  Birth defects may result in disabilities that may be physical , intellectual , or developmental .  The disabilities can range from mild to severe.  Birth defects are divided into two main types: structural disorders in which problems are seen with the shape of a body part and functional disorders in which problems exist with how a body part works.  Functional disorders include metabolic and degenerative disorders .  Some birth defects include both structural and functional disorders.  Birth defects may result from genetic or chromosomal disorders , exposure to certain medications or chemicals, or certain infections during pregnancy .  Risk factors include folate deficiency , drinking alcohol or smoking during pregnancy, poorly controlled diabetes , and a mother over the age of 35 years old.   Many are believed to involve multiple factors.  Birth defects may be visible at birth or diagnosed by screening tests .  A number of defects can be detected before birth by different prenatal tests .  Treatment varies depending on the defect in question.  This may include therapy , medication, surgery, or assistive technology .  Birth defects affected about 96 million people as of 2015.  In the United States, they occur in about 3% of newborns.  They resulted in about 628,000 deaths in 2015, down from 751,000 in 1990.   The types with the greatest numbers of deaths are congenital heart disease , followed by neural tube defects . 	2.5031435
A birth defect  is a defect in a baby at birth, or which develop in the first month of life.  It is neutral as to whether the cause is genetic  or environmental . If a condition is said to be "congenital", that is neutral language. Often it is not known what causes a condition found at birth. In common use, it is often redirected to "birth defect". That term is also neutral as to cause. There are two main types of congenital defect. The first is caused by genetic abnormalities , which are hereditary . The second may be caused by conditions  which a baby may get.  However, we may not know what caused the condition. Sometimes doctors may find out that a baby has a congenital disorder before its birth. They use prenatal diagnosis and screening tests, such as amniocentesis . 	A birth defect , also known as a congenital disorder , is a condition present at birth regardless of its cause.  Birth defects may result in disabilities that may be physical , intellectual , or developmental .  The disabilities can range from mild to severe.  Birth defects are divided into two main types: structural disorders in which problems are seen with the shape of a body part and functional disorders in which problems exist with how a body part works.  Functional disorders include metabolic and degenerative disorders .  Some birth defects include both structural and functional disorders.  Birth defects may result from genetic or chromosomal disorders , exposure to certain medications or chemicals, or certain infections during pregnancy .  Risk factors include folate deficiency , drinking alcohol or smoking during pregnancy, poorly controlled diabetes , and a mother over the age of 35 years old.   Many are believed to involve multiple factors.  Birth defects may be visible at birth or diagnosed by screening tests .  A number of defects can be detected before birth by different prenatal tests .  Treatment varies depending on the defect in question.  This may include therapy , medication, surgery, or assistive technology .  Birth defects affected about 96 million people as of 2015.  In the United States, they occur in about 3% of newborns.  They resulted in about 628,000 deaths in 2015, down from 751,000 in 1990.   The types with the greatest numbers of deaths are congenital heart disease , followed by neural tube defects . 	2.5031435
Medical ethics is the set of ethical rules that doctors follow. These ideas tell doctors how they should treat patients. The earliest set of ethical ideas in medicine was the Hippocratic oath .  It was supposed to be written by Hippocrates but probably was not written by him. There are 6 major principles : Here are some kinds of medical ethics questions:	Medical ethics is an applied branch of ethics which analyzes the practice of clinical medicine and related scientific research. Medical ethics is based on a set of values that professionals can refer to in the case of any confusion or conflict. These values include the respect for autonomy , non-maleficence, beneficence , and justice .  Such tenets may allow doctors, care providers, and families to create a treatment plan and work towards the same common goal.  It is important to note that these four values are not ranked in order of importance or relevance and that they all encompass values pertaining to medical ethics.  However, a conflict may arise leading to the need for hierarchy in an ethical system, such that some moral elements overrule others with the purpose of applying the best moral judgement to a difficult medical situation.  Medical ethics is particularly relevant in decisions regarding involuntary treatment and involuntary commitment . There are several codes of conduct. The Hippocratic Oath discusses basic principles for medical professionals.  This document dates back to the fifth century BCE.  Both The Declaration of Helsinki  and The Nuremberg Code  are two well-known and well respected documents contributing to medical ethics. Other important markings in the history of medical ethics include Roe v. Wade in 1973 and the development of hemodialysis in the 1960s. More recently, new techniques for gene editing aiming at treating, preventing and curing diseases utilizing gene editing, are raising important moral questions about their applications in medicine and treatments as well as societal impacts on future generations.  As this field continues to develop and change throughout history, the focus remains on fair, balanced, and moral thinking across all cultural and religious backgrounds around the world.   The field of medical ethics encompasses both practical application in clinical settings and scholarly work in philosophy , history , and sociology .	2.500282
In psychiatry, the term thought disorder or formal thought disorder refers to a condition where people have problems with consistent and straight thinking leading to abnormalities e.g. with spoken and written language . The people who have this condition use language that is disordered, or sometimes hard to follow. According to the psychiatrists, language is a reflection of thought processes. People who have difficulty speaking therefore often also have difficulty thinking. Thought disorder is considered to be a symptom of psychotic mental illness , but there can also be other causes for it.  The condition it describes is permanent. It affects speech and writing . Those affected may speak all the time, or they may show patterns like switching ideas inside a sentence. They may also use different words that do not fit together at all; this is known as ' word salad '. Eugen Bleuler , who named schizophrenia , held that its defining characteristic was a disorder of the thinking process.  However, although the delusions and hallucinations of psychosis could also be considered as disorders of thought, the term formal thought disorder applies specifically to the presumed disruption in the flow of conscious verbal thought that is inferred from spoken language. This is typically what is referred to when the strictly less accurate, more commonly used but abbreviated term, 'thought disorder', is used.	A thought disorder  is any disturbance in cognition that adversely affects language and thought content, and thereby communication.   A variety of thought disorders were said to be characteristic of people with schizophrenia .  A content-thought disorder is typically characterised by the experience of multiple delusional fragments.  The term, thought disorder, is often used to refer to a formal thought disorder. A formal thought disorder  is a disruption of the form or structure of thought.  Formal thought disorder, also known as disorganised thinking, results in disorganised speech, and is recognised as a major feature of schizophrenia , and other psychoses .   FTD is also associated with conditions including mood disorders , dementia , mania , and neurological diseases .  	2.4657762
An anesthetic or anaesthetic is a substance that stops pain .  It makes people either stop hurting, or go completely to sleep during surgery .  Anesthetic can be rubbed onto the skin, given by injection , or given as a gas to breathe .  The use of an anesthetic is called anaesthesia.  Anaesthesia blocks the pain during operations.  This lets patients undergo surgery and other procedures without the distress and pain they would normally feel.  It comes from Greek roots an-, "without" and aesthetos, "perceptible, able to feel". The modern anesthetic was created by Joseph Lister .  Before it, people sometimes used cocaine , alcohol , and other drugs. Modern anaesthesia is highly complex and often involves a combination of anaesthesia, analgesia and muscle relaxation to enable physicians to do their part. These three tasks are known as the triad of anaesthesia.	An anesthetic  or anaesthetic  is a drug used to induce anesthesia ⁠— ⁠in other words, to result in a temporary loss of sensation or awareness . They may be divided into two broad classes: general anesthetics , which result in a reversible loss of consciousness , and local anesthetics , which cause a reversible loss of sensation for a limited region of the body without necessarily affecting consciousness. A wide variety of drugs are used in modern anesthetic practice.  Many are rarely used outside anesthesiology , but others are used commonly in various fields of healthcare. Combinations of anesthetics are sometimes used for their synergistic and additive therapeutic effects. Adverse effects, however, may also be increased.  Anesthetics are distinct from analgesics , which block only sensation of painful stimuli.	2.4654

Genetic counselling , or counseling , is the process by which clients are advised about genetic disorders . Genetic disorders, by definition, can be passed on in heredity . Example: many descendents of Queen Victoria carried one or both alleles for haemophilia . It was a hereditary disease in European royal families. Clients with a disorder may be interested in the probability of developing or transmitting a genetic disorder to their children. They may ask what the options are to prevent, avoid or improve it. Facilities and rules vary in different countries. In the United States the National Society of Genetic Counselors defines genetic counselling as:  A genetic counsellor is an expert with a Master of Science degree in genetic counseling. In the United States they are certified by the American Board of Genetic Counseling.  Most enter the field from biology , genetics , nursing , psychology , public health and social work . Genetic counsellors need to be expert educators, skilled in translating ideas into terms that are easy to understand.	Genetic counseling is the process of advising individuals and families affected by or at risk of genetic disorders to help them understand and adapt to the medical, psychological and familial implications of genetic contributions to disease; this field is considered necessary for the implementation of genomic medicine.   The process integrates: The practice of advising people about inherited traits began around the turn of the 20th century, shortly after William Bateson suggested that the new medical and biological study of heredity be called “genetics”.  Heredity became intertwined with social reforms when the field of modern eugenics took form. Although initially well-intentioned, ultimately the movement had disastrous consequences; many states in the United States had laws mandating the sterilization of certain individuals, others were not allowed to immigrate and by the 1930s these ideas were accepted by many other countries including in Germany where euthanasia for the “genetically defective” was legalized in 1939.  This part of the history of genetics is at the heart of the now “non directive” approach to genetic counseling.  Sheldon Clark Reed coined the term genetic counseling in 1947 and published the book Counseling in Medical Genetics in 1955.  Most of the early genetic counseling clinics were run by non-medical scientists or by those who were not experienced clinicians.  With the growth in knowledge of genetic disorders and the appearance of medical genetics as a distinct specialty in the 1960s, genetic counseling progressively became medicalized, representing one of the key components of clinical genetics.  It was not, though, until later that the importance of a firm psychological basis was recognized and became an essential part of genetic counseling, the writings of Seymour Kessler making a particular contribution to this.  The first master's degree genetic counseling program in the United States was founded in 1969 at Sarah Lawrence College in Bronxville, New York.  In 1979, the National Society of Genetic Counselors  was founded and led by the first president, Audrey Heimler. 	2.451324
An epidemic is a disease that spreads over a large area and affects many people at the same time. Epidemics are when a disease spreads from person to person faster than doctors can control. If the disease spreads over the whole world , sometimes it is called a pandemic . Such diseases must be treated quickly and properly otherwise they can infect people on large scale and pose a danger to the world. It is very important that timely vaccination and treatment is provided. The study of epidemics is part of epidemiology .	An epidemic  is the rapid spread of disease to a large number of people in a given population within a short period of time. For example, in meningococcal infections , an attack rate in excess of 15 cases per 100,000 people for two consecutive weeks is considered an epidemic.   Epidemics of infectious disease are generally caused by several factors including a change in the ecology of the host population , a genetic change in the pathogen reservoir or the introduction of an emerging patholow that found in the endemic equilibrium and the transmission threshold is exceeded.  An epidemic may be restricted to one location; however, if it spreads to other countries or continents and affects a substantial number of people, it may be termed a pandemic .  The declaration of an epidemic usually requires a good understanding of a baseline rate of incidence ; epidemics for certain diseases, such as influenza , are defined as reaching some defined increase in incidence above this baseline.  A few cases of a very rare disease may be classified as an epidemic, while many cases of a common disease  would not. An epidemic can cause enormous damage through financial and economic losses in addition to impaired health and loss of life.	2.4154806
A patient is a person receiving medical care and/or treatment.	A patient is any recipient of health care services that are performed by healthcare professionals . The patient is most often ill or injured and in need of treatment by a physician , nurse , psychologist , dentist , veterinarian , or other health care provider . The word patient originally meant 'one who suffers'. This English noun comes from the Latin word patiens , the present participle of the deponent verb , patior , meaning 'I am suffering,' and akin to the Greek verb πάσχειν  and its cognate noun πάθος .	2.413673
Syncope is the medical term for fainting or blacking out . It is a sudden loss of consciousness , usually for a short time. It is mostly because there is not enough oxygen in the brain . It can be for other reasons. Fainting is quite common. It usually happens in two age ranges: the teenage years, and during older age. The chance of a person fainting at least once in a lifetime is about 40 to 50 percent. Syncope causes 1 to 3 percent of all attendances to emergency departments and 1 to 6 percent of all hospital admissions.  	Syncope may refer to:	2.4102466
An antivenom is a medicine used to protect against a specific venom.  Frequently the venom of some creature such as a cobra will be harvested and a little will be injected using a hypodermic needle into a horse every day for a long time. The horse's body will develop an immunity to the venom, so more and more venom from the snake can be injected every day. After the horse is immune, its blood can be drawn little by little to get the part of the blood that makes the horse immune. That part can then be injected into humans who have been bitten by cobras. There are antivenoms for the very large and very dangerous funnel-web spiders found in Australia, and for the widow spiders  found all around the world.	Antivenom , also known as antivenin , venom antiserum , and antivenom immunoglobulin , is a specific treatment for envenomation . It is composed of antibodies and used to treat certain venomous bites and stings.  Antivenoms are recommended only if there is significant toxicity or a high risk of toxicity.  The specific antivenom needed depends on the species involved.  It is given by injection.  Side effects may be severe.  They include serum sickness , shortness of breath , and allergic reactions including anaphylaxis .  Antivenom is traditionally made by collecting venom from the relevant animal and injecting small amounts of it into a domestic animal.  The antibodies that form are then collected from the domestic animal's blood and purified.  Versions are available for spider bites , snake bites , fish stings , and scorpion stings .  Due to the high cost of producing antibody-based antivenoms and their short shelf lives when not refrigerated, alternative methods of production of antivenoms are being actively explored.  One such different method of production involves production from bacteria.  Another approach is to develop targeted drugs .  Antivenom was first developed in the late 19th century and came into common use in the 1950s.   It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines . 	2.4102442

Diarrhea , also spelled diarrhoea , happens when the body makes more watery feces than normal.  Diarrhea can occur in humans as well as most other mammals. Diarrhea is not a disease .  But it may be a symptom of a disease.  The most common causes of diarrhea are:  In developing nations , diarrheal diseases are the second most common cause of death in children under age 5.  Every year in the world, diarrhea kills around 760,000 children under age 5.  In developing countries, diarrhea is also one of the most common causes of malnutrition in children under age 5. 	Diarrhea , also spelled diarrhoea , is the condition of having at least three loose, liquid, or watery bowel movements each day.  It often lasts for a few days and can result in dehydration due to fluid loss.  Signs of dehydration often begin with loss of the normal stretchiness of the skin and irritable behaviour.  This can progress to decreased urination , loss of skin color , a fast heart rate , and a decrease in responsiveness as it becomes more severe.  Loose but non-watery stools in babies who are exclusively breastfed , however, are normal. 	2.403065
Antipsychotic drugs or Neuroleptics are drugs that act on the central nervous system , and that usually have sedating properties. The name neuroleptic was introduced in 1955, from the 1990s, the term antipsychotic is used more frequently. Neuroleptics make the patient calm. Today, they are mostly used for the treatment of psychosis , as it occurs in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder . They can also be used to treat depression and mood swings. Very strong antipsychotics can be combined with an opioid to produce a special analgesic ; the patient will be conscious, but heavily sedated , and feel very little pain . The main inventor of this drug was Andrew J. Smith whom at the time was 16 when he made it. He created this drug that has saved hundreds of people with schizophrenia.	Antipsychotics , also known as neuroleptics ,  are a class of psychotropic medication primarily used to manage psychosis , principally in schizophrenia but also in a range of other psychotic disorders.  They are also the mainstay together with mood stabilizers in the treatment of bipolar disorder .  Recent research has shown that use of any antipsychotic results in smaller brain tissue volumes and that this brain shrinkage is dose dependent and time dependent.  A review of the research has also reinforced this effect. 	2.3974984
The painting Starry Night by Vincent van Gogh who suffered from migraine, is his impression of a migraine aura.  An aura is the changes that people see, hear, smell, taste, or feel before they have an epileptic seizure , or before they have a migraine . It comes from the Greek word for breeze. The cause of the aura is related to the way the brain works, so this is a neurological condition. There are different kinds of migraines. About 15% of people who have a migraine will have an aura. The symptoms may include visual problems like not being able to see for a short time, seeing zig-zag lines or floating spots, dizziness , a ringing noise in the ears , and problems speaking.  It may take up to an hour after the aura begins before a person starts getting a migraine. Many people with epilepsy have an aura before having a seizure.  This can be helpful, because the aura can tell the person that a seizure is coming ahead of time, and give them time to get to a safe place.  The time between the aura and the seizure is usually short .	An aura is a perceptual disturbance experienced by some with epilepsy or migraine . An epileptic aura is in fact a seizure.  Epileptic and migraine auras are due to the involvement of specific areas of the brain, which are those that determine the symptoms of the aura. Therefore, if the visual area is affected, the aura will consist of visual symptoms, while if a sensory one, then sensory symptoms will occur. Epileptic auras are subjective sensory or psychic phenomena due to a focal seizure, i.e. a seizure that originates from that area of the brain responsible for the function which then expresses itself with the symptoms of the aura. It is important because it makes it clear where the alteration causing the seizure is located. An epileptic aura is in most cases followed by other manifestations of a seizure, for example a convulsion, since the epileptic discharge spreads to other parts of the brain. Rarely it remains isolated. Auras, when they occur, allow some people who have epilepsy time to prevent injury to themselves and/or others when they lose consciousness.	2.3883271
Brine is water that has more than 5% salt in it. It is used for preserving food . For this it is much like vinegar or sugar . Brine is also used to transport heat . Adding salt to water lowers the freezing point of the water. The solubility of salt in water depends on temperature. At 15.5 ° Celsius , a saturated solution of brine can hold 26.4 % salt by weight. At 0°, it can hold 23.3% salt. Brines also have some pharmaceutical properties, which can be used to treat people, especially those with diseases of the skin , allergies and common colds . 	Brine is a high-concentration solution of salt  in water .  In different contexts, brine may refer to salt solutions ranging from about 3.5%  up to about 26% . Lower levels of concentration are called by different names: fresh water , brackish water , and saline water . Brine naturally occurs on the Earth's surface , crust, and within brine pools on ocean bottom. High-concentration brine lakes typically emerge due to evaporation of ground saline water on high ambient temperatures. Brine is used for food processing and cooking , for de-icing of roads and other structures, and in a number of technological processes. It is also a by-product of many industrial processes , such as desalination , and may pose an environmental risk due to its corrosive and toxic effects, so it requires wastewater treatment for proper disposal or further utilization .  Saline water with relatively high concentration of salt  occurs naturally on Earth's surface , crust, and within brine pools on ocean bottom.	2.3720078
An anaphrodisiac is something that makes the one who uses it less aroused . This can be a medicine ,  a food or a procedure.  It is sometimes used to treat hypersexuals .  It is also used for an animal that is in heat.  Pills that lower the libido are sometimes called antaphrodisiacs . 	An anaphrodisiac  is a substance that quells or blunts the libido . It is the opposite of an aphrodisiac , something that enhances sexual appetite. The word anaphrodisiac comes from the Greek privative prefix ἀν- , denoting negation, and aphrodisiac , from the Greek goddess of love, Aphrodite . Some people use anaphrodisiacs in order to curb a very high libido or due to hypersexuality .  However anaphrodisiacs are also used by those with an average libido, at times due to having incessant schedules.  Some common anaphrodisiacs are ethanol  and tobacco , but this is typically an unintended consequence and not often the main reason for use. While alcohol is used socially because it initially reduces mental inhibitions, studies have shown that over time alcohol physically decreases arousal and makes achieving climax more difficult.  For this reason alcohol is considered an anaphrodisiac. Opioids , the class of pain-reducing substances which include morphine , heroin , and hydrocodone , are anaphrodisiacs.	2.3580837
Amphetamine is a synthetic drug . The drug is a stimulant : it can help people keep the focus and stay awake. It also decreases appetite and fatigue . Chemically, it is similar to methamphetamine . These drugs increase the level of dopamine and norepinephrine in the brain , which can create euphoria .   The class of drugs containing amphetamine includes prescription drugs commonly used to treat attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder . It is also used to treat symptoms of traumatic brain injury  and the daytime drowsiness symptoms of narcolepsy , amongst others. Initially, amphetamine was more popularly used to reduce appetite and to control weight. Sometimes, the drug is used for fun or to boost performance.  Many different names are used for amphetamines.  They include Benzedrine and speed .  The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction reports the typical retail price of amphetamine in Europe varied between €3 and €15  a gram in half of the reporting countries.  The name amphetamine is derived from its chemical name: a lpha- m ethyl ph en et hyl amine .	Amphetamine   is a central nervous system  stimulant that is used in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder , narcolepsy , and obesity . Amphetamine was discovered in 1887 and exists as two enantiomers :  levoamphetamine and dextroamphetamine . Amphetamine properly refers to a specific chemical, the racemic free base , which is equal parts of the two enantiomers, levoamphetamine and dextroamphetamine, in their pure amine forms. The term is frequently used informally to refer to any combination of the enantiomers, or to either of them alone. Historically, it has been used to treat nasal congestion and depression. Amphetamine is also used as an athletic performance enhancer and cognitive enhancer , and recreationally as an aphrodisiac and euphoriant . It is a prescription drug in many countries, and unauthorized possession and distribution of amphetamine are often tightly controlled due to the significant health risks associated with recreational use .  The first amphetamine pharmaceutical was Benzedrine , a brand which was used to treat a variety of conditions. Currently, pharmaceutical amphetamine is prescribed as racemic amphetamine, Adderall ,  dextroamphetamine , or the inactive prodrug lisdexamfetamine . Amphetamine increases monoamine and excitatory neurotransmission in the brain, with its most pronounced effects targeting the norepinephrine and dopamine neurotransmitter systems . 	2.352547
In the United Kingdom , certain drugs are classified as controlled drugs . Controlled drugs are illegal to possess, use, or supply to others without a license . These drugs are governed under the Misuse of Drugs Act of 1971. This act defines three categories of controlled drugs: A , B , and C . The penalties for illegaly possessing, using or supplying a controlled drug are different depending on which category the drug belongs to. Many of these drugs are also governed by other laws, such as the Medicines Act . Also, there are many other drugs that are not controlled by the Misuse of Drugs Act but that are controlled by other laws. Class A drugs are drugs that are considered the most dangerous. They carry the harshest punishments . Class C drugs are those that are thought to be much less dangerous. They therefore carry much less serious punishments. More serious punishments are dealt if the person is considered to have had the intention to supply the drug to others. Possession with intent to supply carries a maximum penalty of life in prison . The laws governing the use and supply of drugs for medical purposes are not part of the Misuse of Drugs Act. A different set of categories apply, which are defined in the Misuse of Drugs Regulations. This sets out five schedules, each with their own restrictions. These restrictions say that a person can possess and use certain drugs if they have the proper prescriptions for them. A prescriptions must be given by somebody who is licensed to provide it . The drug  itself must be supplied by somebody who is licensed to supply it .		2.3356407
A cough , also known as tussis , is an action the body takes to get rid of anything that irritates the lungs or throat. To do this, muscles in the thoracic cavity contract to make air leave the lungs with a lot of force. Coughs often happen quickly and more than once, and are usually accompanied by a unique sound, also called a cough. Coughs are more likely to happen when a person is sick, because infections often irritate breathing passages. Another cause of coughs is a person breathing air that is not clean like dust .	A cough is a sudden expulsion of air through the large breathing passages that can help clear them of fluids, irritants, foreign particles and microbes . As a protective reflex , coughing can be repetitive with the cough reflex following three phases: an inhalation , a forced exhalation against a closed glottis , and a violent release of air from the lungs following opening of the glottis, usually accompanied by a distinctive sound.  Frequent coughing usually indicates the presence of a disease. Many viruses and bacteria benefit, from an evolutionary perspective, by causing the host to cough, which helps to spread the disease to new hosts. Most of the time, irregular coughing is caused by a respiratory tract infection but can also be triggered by choking , smoking , air pollution ,  asthma , gastroesophageal reflux disease , post-nasal drip , chronic bronchitis , lung tumors , heart failure and medications such as angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors  . Treatment should target the cause; for example, smoking cessation or discontinuing ACE inhibitors. Cough suppressants such as codeine or dextromethorphan are frequently prescribed, but have been demonstrated to have little effect. Other treatment options may target airway inflammation or may promote mucus expectoration . As it is a natural protective reflex, suppressing the cough reflex might have damaging effects, especially if the cough is productive. 	2.3228736
Traditional Chinese medicine  is a branch of traditional medicine from China . It is at least 3,500 years old. Treatments include herbal medicine , acupuncture , cupping , massage , and exercise . Since the methods of TCM are different from Western medicine , it is hard to find evidence that shows how safe or good TCM really is. Many of the most important ideas in TCM are based on the teachings of Daoism . Based on the teachings of TCM, it is important to balance the five elements in a person's body: wood, fire, earth, metal, and water. Each element also has something called yin and yang , or opposite values that must exist alongside each other rather than to overcome the other. The way to balance the yin and yang is to strengthen qi , or an invisible force that brings balance to the yin and yang . Knowing the five elements and the yin and yang is important because each organ of the body is related to one of the five elements. It is important to strengthen a person's qi because balancing the yin and yang of a person's organs is important for people to be healthy.  The different treatments in TCM are made to bring balance to the elements in a person's body. These ideas are similar to, but not the same as, the four temperaments , which was an widely-believed theory in European medicine before scientific medicine was created.	Traditional Chinese medicine  is a branch of traditional medicine in China. It has been described as "fraught with pseudoscience ", and the majority of its treatments as having no logical mechanism of action .  TCM is said to be based on Compendium of Materia Medica and Huangdi Neijing . The practice includes various forms of herbal medicine , acupuncture , cupping therapy , gua sha , massage  , bonesetter  , exercise  , and dietary therapy.  TCM is widely used in the Sinosphere ,     where it has a long history; subsequently it is now also practiced outside of China.   One of the basic tenets of TCM is that the body's vital energy  is circulating through channels called meridians having branches connected to bodily organs and functions.  The concept of vital energy is pseudoscientific. Concepts of the body and of disease used in TCM reflect its ancient origins and its emphasis on dynamic processes over material structure, similar to the humoral theory of Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome .  The use of traditional medicine in China has been a major generator of illegal wildlife smuggling , linked to the killing and smuggling of endangered animals and the primary consumer of the illegal ivory trade . The trade being a major factor for endangering species leading to extinction of biodiversity collapse in many places of the world. 	2.306379
When people are dreaming , their muscles do not move, even if in their dream they are moving. This is a natural process which prevents that people actually perform the movements they do in their sleep. In general, people are not aware of this inability to move, as it usually stops as soon as they wake up. People suffering from sleep paralysis wake up and find that they are unable to move. This is because the paralysis has not stopped. Usually it lasts for only a few minutes, and people have said they feel a "presence" or " ghost " during it. Little is known about the physiology of sleep paralysis. However, some have suggested that it may be linked to post- synaptic  inhibition  of nerves in the pons  region of the brain . In particular, low levels of melatonin may stop the depolarization current in the nerves, which stops stimulation of the muscles. Hallucinations of ghosts, demons and Out of Body Experiences during sleep paralysis may be caused by a part of the brain called the parietal lobe , and by neurons known as mirror neurons.    Studies suggest that many people get sleep paralysis at least once in their lives. People who have narcolepsy often get it much more. Many people try to induce sleep paralysis, to have an Out of Body Experience .	Sleep paralysis is a state, during waking up or falling asleep , in which a person is aware but unable to move or speak.   During an episode, one may hallucinate , which often results in fear .  Episodes generally last less than a couple of minutes.  It may occur as a single episode or be recurrent.  The condition may occur in those who are otherwise healthy or those with narcolepsy , or it may run in families as a result of specific genetic changes.  The condition can be triggered by sleep deprivation , psychological stress , or abnormal sleep cycles .  The underlying mechanism is believed to involve a dysfunction in REM sleep .  Sleep paralysis is commonly experienced by lucid dreamers; some lucid dreamers use this as a method of having a lucid dream .  Diagnosis is based on a person's description.  Other conditions that can present similarly include narcolepsy, atonic seizure , and hypokalemic periodic paralysis .  Treatment options for sleep paralysis have been poorly studied.  It is recommended that people be reassured that the condition is common and generally not serious.  Other efforts that may be tried include sleep hygiene , cognitive behavioral therapy , and antidepressants . 	2.301314
An Antiplatelet drug is a drug that acts against blood clotting. The blood contains platelets , which will stick together, and close an open wound. In some cases, they also stick together in the bloodstream, and form blood clots . Such blood clots cause Strokes and Heart attacks . Another type of drug that prevents clotting is called anticoagulant . Anticoagulants cannot be used to prevent blood clotting in the arteries . Antiplatelet drugs are commonly used in the prevention of strokes and heart attacks. Acetylsalicylic acid , commonly known as Aspirin, is one of them.	An antiplatelet drug , also known as a platelet agglutination inhibitor or platelet aggregation inhibitor , is a member of a class of pharmaceuticals that decrease platelet aggregation  and inhibit thrombus formation. They are effective in the arterial circulation where anticoagulants have little effect.  They are widely used in primary and secondary prevention of thrombotic cerebrovascular or cardiovascular disease. Antiplatelet therapy with one or more of these drugs decreases the ability of blood clots to form by interfering with the platelet activation process in primary hemostasis .  Antiplatelet drugs can reversibly or irreversibly inhibit the process involved in platelet activation resulting in decreased tendency of platelets to adhere to one another and to damaged blood vessels' endothelium. 	2.2837446
A delusion is a false belief held by a person. If doctors talk about delusions they mean that the false belief is the result of some disease , usually a disease of the mind , such as paranoia , schizophrenia or bipolar disorder , but not always neccesarily,  delusions can come in many different forms such as political differences, economic differences such as a god complex upheld by someone who believes they are all powerful and many other types. Delusions also have other properties, according to Karl Jaspers :  Studies on psychiatric patients show that delusions vary in intensity and conviction over time, which suggests that certainty and incorrigibility are not necessary components of a delusional belief.  Delusions do not necessarily have to be false or 'incorrect inferences about external reality'.  Some religious or spiritual beliefs by their nature may not be falsifiable, and hence cannot be described as false or incorrect, no matter whether the person holding these beliefs was diagnosed as delusional or not.  A doctor or psychiatrist may say that a delusion is false, because it seems to be unlikely or bizarre.Psychiatrists rarely have the time or resources to check the validity of a person’s claims; this means that some true beliefs are erroneously classified as delusional.  This is known as the Martha Mitchell effect , after the wife of the attorney general who alleged that illegal activity was taking place in the White House . At the time her claims were thought to be signs of mental illness. Only after the Watergate scandal was she proved right, and sane.	A delusion is a fixed belief that is not amenable to change in light of conflicting evidence.  As a pathology, it is distinct from a belief based on false or incomplete information, confabulation , dogma , illusion , or some other misleading effects of perception as individuals with these beliefs are able to change or readjust their beliefs upon viewing the evidence for these beliefs. Delusions have been found to occur in the context of many pathological states  and are of particular diagnostic importance in psychotic disorders including schizophrenia , paraphrenia , manic episodes of bipolar disorder , and psychotic depression .	2.2810147
Dacarbizine is a type of drug used to fight cancer .  It works by changing DNA , which makes cancer cells grow more slowly or completely stop growing.  It is used against metastatic melanoma .  Only about 15.3% of people who use the drug respond to it.  People who use this drug do not live any longer as a result.  It has side effects , including less blood cells , damage to the liver .  I can also sometimes make other types of cancer start growing. 	Dacarbazine ,  also known as imidazole carboxamide , is a chemotherapy medication used in the treatment of melanoma and Hodgkin's lymphoma .  For Hodgkin's it is often used together with vinblastine , bleomycin , and doxorubicin .  It is given by injection into a vein .  Common side effects include loss of appetite, vomiting, low white blood cell count , and low platelets .  Other serious side effects include liver problems and allergic reactions .  It is unclear if use in pregnancy is safe for the baby.  Dacarbazine is in the alkylating agent and purine analog families of medication.  Dacarbazine was approved for medical use in the United States in 1975.  It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines . 	2.2760546
Barbiturates are a group of drugs that are derivates of Barbituric acid . Adolf von Baeyer was the first to produce Barbituric acid, in 1863. For many years, barbiturates were used as sedatives . Today, their use is very limited in many countries, mainly because they cause addiction and people soon develop a tolerance . People with a drug tolerance will need a higher dosage of the drug to get the same effect as before.  After a while, the drug becomes useless for such people. Barbiturates were once used as a primary treatment for Epilepsy ; this is especially true for the substance called Phenobarbitol or Phenobarbitone .  The sedative side effect of the drug made it increasingly unpopular, and it is now prescribed less for epilepsy, in favor of other drugs that do not have sedative effects. Benzodiazepines are another group of drugs, which have sedative properties: They make people sleepy, and help them sleep. In contrast, Barbiturates force people to sleep. In the case of severe sleeping problems which cannot be controlled by other drugs, Barbiturates are sometimes used as off-label drugs .	A barbiturate  is a drug that acts as a central nervous system depressant . Barbiturates are effective as anxiolytics , hypnotics , and anticonvulsants , but have physical and psychological addiction potential as well as overdose potential among other possible adverse effects. They have largely been replaced by benzodiazepines and nonbenzodiazepines  in routine medical practice, particularly in the treatment of anxiety and insomnia, due to the significantly lower risk of addiction and overdose and the lack of an antidote for barbiturate overdose. Despite this, barbiturates are still in use for various purposes: in general anesthesia , epilepsy , treatment of acute migraines or cluster headaches , acute tension headaches , euthanasia , capital punishment , and assisted suicide .  The name barbiturate originates from the fact that they are all chemical derivatives of barbituric acid .  Barbiturates such as phenobarbital were long used as anxiolytics and hypnotics . Intermediate-acting barbiturates reduce time to fall asleep, increase total sleep time, and reduce REM sleep time. Today they have been largely replaced by benzodiazepines for these purposes because the latter are less toxic in drug overdose .    However, barbiturates are still used as anticonvulsants  and general anesthetics .	2.2751987
An eye drop is a type of treatment and medicine for the eye . It is used to stop someones eye from hurting. It may also be used to cure eye infections .  Eye drops are safe for children most of the time.  However, using eye drops for too much time can make the eyes turn red or hurt the child.   Some eye drops are made for children. 	Eye drops or eyedrops are saline -containing drops used as an ocular route to administer . Depending on the condition being treated, they may contain steroids , antihistamines , sympathomimetics , beta receptor blockers , parasympathomimetics , parasympatholytics , prostaglandins , nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs , antibiotics , antifungals , or topical anesthetics . Eye drops sometimes do not have medications in them and are only lubricating and tear -replacing solutions. Eye drops have less of a risk of side effects than do oral medicines, and such risk can be minimized by occluding the lacrimal punctum  for a short while after instilling drops. Eye drops are also used for stopping itching and redness of the eyes. Prior to the development of single-use pre-loaded sterile plastic applicators, eye drops were administered using an eye dropper , a glass pipette with a rubber bulb.	2.2658076
Therapy , in the medical field also called treatment , is what people do to try to solve or care for a health problem, physical or mental . When a person is ill or injured , a doctor may make a medical diagnosis and then recommend a therapy to try to make the person well.  The therapy can be, for example, medications , surgery or a change of diet . A person who does therapy as a job is called a therapist. There are many kinds of therapists.  for example: Medical treatments may have four results:	A therapy or medical treatment  is the attempted remediation of a health problem, usually following a medical diagnosis . As a rule, each therapy has indications and contraindications .  There are many different types of therapy.  Not all therapies are effective .  Many therapies can produce unwanted adverse effects . Treatment and therapy are generally considered synonyms.  However,  in the context of mental health , the term therapy may refer specifically to psychotherapy .	2.2641814
A Plague doctor was a doctor in the 1300s who tried to stop plague from spreading. The doctors would also carry canes to poke bodies to test if they were still alive and to remind them to stay the correct distance away.  The doctors could also examine patients using the cane.  The doctors would wear large masks that looked like birds' beaks.  This was because people believed the plague spread on bad air.  The beaks of the masks were filled with plants, vinegar sponges, or perfume to protect the doctor from the bad air.  Plague doctors wore robes covered in wax so body fluids would not stick to it.  They wore glass goggles over their eyes.  They would wear goggles if they could.   People in the Venetian Carnival dress as plague doctors. 	A Plague doctor was a physician who treated victims of the bubonic plague  during epidemics . These physicians were hired by cities to treat infected patients regardless of income, especially the poor that could not afford to pay.  Plague doctors are often depicted in Halloween costumes and seen as a symbol of death and disease.  Plague doctors had a mixed reputation, with some citizens seeing their presence as a warning to leave the area.  Some plague doctors were said to charge patients and their families additional fees for special treatments or false cures.  In many cases these "doctors" were not experienced physicians or surgeons ; instead, being volunteers, second-rate doctors, or young doctors just starting a career.  In one case, a plague doctor was a fruit salesman before his employment as a physician. Plague doctors rarely cured patients; instead serving to record death tolls and the number of infected people for demographic purposes.  In France and the Netherlands , plague doctors often lacked medical training and were referred to as " empirics ." Plague doctors were known as municipal or "community plague doctors", whereas "general practitioners" were separate doctors and both might be in the same European city or town at the same time.    	2.2583473
Pseudoallergy is something a living body does when it takes a new medicine for the first time.  A pseudollergic response, can mean an anaphylactic reaction, which means too much water leaves the blood.  A pseudoallery is not an immune response.  Human beings can die from pseudoallergies. 	A pseudoallergy is a condition named for its similar presentation to a true allergy , though due to different causes.  It may be due to alterations in the metabolism of histamine .  It can be the cause of some forms of food intolerance . 	2.2421236
The 2020 stock market crash is a global stock market crash that began on 20 February 2020 during the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic .    The Dow Jones Industrial Average , S&P 500 Index , and the NASDAQ-100 all fell into short-term decline on 27 February during one of the worst trading weeks since the financial crisis of 2007–08 .   Markets over the following week  became extremely bad, with swings of 3% or more being made per daily session .   On 9 March, all three Wall Street indices fell more than 7% and most global markets reported severe losses, due to the response of the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic and the Russia–Saudi Arabia oil price war .   This became known as Black Monday , and at the time was the worst drop since the Great Recession in 2008.   Three days after Black Monday there was another drop, Black Thursday , where stocks across Europe and North America fell more than 9%.	The 2020 stock market crash was a major and sudden global stock market crash that began on 20 February 2020 and ended on 7 April. Beginning on 13 May 2019, the yield curve on U.S. Treasury securities inverted ,  and remained so until 11 October 2019, when it reverted to normal .  Through 2019, while some economists  argued that a recession in the following year was likely,   other economists  argued that inverted yield curves may no longer be a reliable recession predictor.   The yield curve on U.S. Treasuries would not invert again until 30 January 2020 when the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern ,   four weeks after local health commission officials in Wuhan , China announced the first 27 COVID-19 cases as a viral pneumonia strain outbreak on 1 January . 	2.2398913

A medical diagnosis  is when a doctor finds out what is making someone sick.  Sometimes doctors can diagnose a sickness by asking the person questions and looking at the person's body. Sometimes doctors do tests . Tests can mean taking a small bit of blood , urine , or tissue which is sent to a hospital laboratory where it is tested. X-rays are another form of test. Tests are ways to see how the body is working. When a diagnosis has been made, the doctor may recommend treatment . The process of diagnosis begins from the very beginning of the patient's examination in a medical institution or during a call to the doctor at the patient's place of residence. Diagnosis of the disease begins with the collection of medical history. After collecting the anamnesis, the doctor examines the patient, during which he performs percussion and auscultation of the patient, palpation of the disease, measures the patient's blood pressure , heart rate and respiration rate, and measures the patient's body temperature . Laboratory examination methods include general clinical tests, which include a general blood test, a general urine test, and a stool test. Laboratory methods of examination also include biochemical methods of examination, during which the level of glucose, creatinine, urea, bilirubin, liver enzymes, blood lipids is determined; coagulogram, which analyzes the indicators of blood clotting; blood hormone tests; determination of tumor markers; tests of blood and other biological materials for infectious diseases; allergological , toxicological , cytological and parasitological examinations.	Medical diagnosis  is the process of determining which disease or condition explains a person's symptoms and signs . It is most often referred to as diagnosis with the medical context being implicit. The information required for diagnosis is typically collected from a history and physical examination of the person seeking medical care. Often, one or more diagnostic procedures , such as medical tests , are also done during the process. Sometimes posthumous diagnosis is considered a kind of medical diagnosis. Diagnosis is often challenging, because many signs and symptoms are nonspecific , and can only be undertaken by registered and licensed health professionals. For example, redness of the skin , by itself, is a sign of many disorders and thus does not tell the healthcare professional what is wrong. Thus differential diagnosis , in which several possible explanations are compared and contrasted, must be performed. This involves the correlation of various pieces of information followed by the recognition and differentiation of patterns. Occasionally the process is made easy by a sign or symptom  that is pathognomonic . Diagnosis is a major component of the procedure of a doctor's visit . From the point of view of statistics , the diagnostic procedure involves classification tests .	2.1789804
The Curie Institute or Institut Curie is one of the leading medical research centres in the world.  It is a private non-profit foundation for research into cancer . It is located in Paris , France .  It was founded by Marie Curie and got state approval as a foundation in 1921. There are several hundred research staff at the Institute. Institut Curie does not offer undergrduate degrees, but does award Ph.D.s. Institut Curie runs the Hôpital Claudius Régaud , a cancer treatment hospital. Five Nobel prizes are attached to the Institute's researchers.

The institute now operates several research units in cooperation with national research institutions CNRS and INSERM . There are several hundred research staff at the institute.  Institut Curie does not offer undergraduate degrees, but awards PhDs and employs many postdoctoral students alongside its permanent staff. Institut Curie is a constituent college  of University PSL . 	2.172644
Hyperactivity  can be described as a physical state. People who have it can not control their overactive behavior and are abnormally active. 	Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder  is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by inattention , or excessive activity and impulsivity , which are otherwise not appropriate for a person's age.     Some individuals with ADHD also display difficulty regulating emotions or problems with executive function .     For a diagnosis, the symptoms have to be present for more than six months, and cause problems in at least two settings .   In children, problems paying attention may result in poor school performance .  Additionally, it is associated with other mental disorders and substance use disorders .  Although it causes impairment, particularly in modern society, many people with ADHD can have sustained attention for tasks they find interesting or rewarding .   Despite being the most commonly studied and diagnosed mental disorder in children and adolescents, the precise cause or causes are unknown in the majority of cases.  Genetic factors are estimated to make up about 75% of the risk.  Nicotine exposure during pregnancy may be an environmental risk.  It does not appear to be related to the style of parenting or discipline.  It affects about 5–7% of children when diagnosed via the DSM-IV criteria   and 1–2% when diagnosed via the ICD-10 criteria.  As of 2019, it was estimated to affect 84.7 million people globally.  Rates are similar between countries and differences in rates depend mostly on how it is diagnosed.  ADHD is diagnosed approximately two times more often in boys than in girls,  although the disorder is often overlooked in girls because their symptoms are often less disruptive.    About 30–50% of people diagnosed in childhood continue to have symptoms into adulthood and between 2–5% of adults have the condition.    In adults, inner restlessness, rather than hyperactivity, may occur.  Adults often develop coping skills which compensate for some or all of their impairments.  The condition can be difficult to tell apart from other conditions, as well as from high levels of activity within the range of normal behavior. 	2.1116407
Dentures  are meant to solve dental problems of humans . They should not be worn overnight.  Famous people who wore them for years include George Washington .  The history goes back as early as 7th century BC . 	Dentures  are prosthetic devices constructed to replace missing teeth , and are supported by the surrounding soft and hard tissues of the oral cavity . Conventional dentures are removable . However, there are many denture designs, some which rely on bonding or clasping onto teeth or dental implants . There are two main categories of dentures, the distinction being whether they are used to replace missing teeth on the mandibular arch or on the maxillary arch . Dentures do not feel like real teeth, nor do they function like real teeth.  Dentures can help people through:	2.1099133
A pharmaceutical capsule is an easy way to take medication . Capsules may contain powder , liquid or oil .  The outer shell is made of hard or soft gelatin . Capsules come in different shapes and colors to identify dose or what company made them.  They are also available as timed release which work over a period of time. Capsules should usually be taken whole. Always consult a pharmacist or desk reference before opening a capsule. Capsules should also not be crushed without first checking to see if it is safe.

Aminoglycosides are antibiotics used for gram negative infections. Gram-negative means that the bacteria which cause the infection don't hold the color of a particular dye  when they're tested. Since they are not absorbed from the gut, they are usually taken by an injection into the vain or muscle but they can be given as a cream or ointment to prevent and treat skin infections, as eye drops for eye infections, as ear drops for ear infections and as a pill for intestinal infections but not for other internal infections. Antibiotics from this family can be used in patients who are not able to take some regular antibiotics, such as Penicillin because of allergies.  The most common Aminoglycosides used as alternatives to Penicillin are Erythromycin  and Clarithromycin .  They're most commonly used in the treatment of bacterial infections, such as Bronchitis . Kanamycin A Amikacin	Aminoglycoside is a medicinal and bacteriologic category of traditional Gram-negative antibacterial medications that inhibit protein synthesis and contain as a portion of the molecule an amino-modified glycoside .   The term can also refer more generally to any organic molecule that contains amino sugar substructures. Aminoglycoside antibiotics display bactericidal activity against Gram-negative aerobes and some anaerobic bacilli where resistance has not yet arisen but generally not against Gram-positive and anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria.  Streptomycin is the first-in-class aminoglycoside antibiotic . It is derived from Streptomyces griseus and is the earliest modern agent used against tuberculosis . Streptomycin lacks the common 2-deoxystreptamine moiety  present in most other members of this class. Other examples of aminoglycosides include the deoxystreptamine-containing agents kanamycin , tobramycin , gentamicin , and neomycin . Aminoglycosides that are derived from bacteria of the Streptomyces genus are named with the suffix -mycin , whereas those that are derived from Micromonospora  are named with the suffix -micin .  However, this nomenclature system is not specific for aminoglycosides, and so appearance of this set of suffixes does not imply common mechanism of action. 	2.086015
Both perception  and remembering are processes which involve the brain . For this reason, errors do sometimes occur. Errors in perception are commonly called illusions . Emil Kraepelin used the term "Erinnerungsverfälschung"  to speak about false memories .    Perceptions need stimuli to be created. A perception without a stimulus is called hallucination . Much like the difference between illusion and hallucination, Kraepelin wanted to distinguish between a false memory and memories of something that did not really happen, which he called "Erinnerkungsfälschung". Unfortunately, both German terms translate to the same English term. A false memory is a condition where a person remembers something that did not occur or where the memory does not closely match the occurrence. Using suggestion and hypnosis , it is possible to make people believe they experienced something, when they did not. Such phenomena also occur spontaneously, for example in a stressful situation , or when someone is not sleeping enough .	In psychology , a false memory is a phenomenon where someone recalls something that did not happen or recalls it differently from the way it actually happened. Suggestibility , activation of associated information, the incorporation of misinformation, and source misattribution have been suggested to be several mechanisms underlying a variety of types of false memory phenomena. False memories are a component of false memory syndrome .  The false memory phenomenon was initially investigated by psychological pioneers Pierre Janet and Sigmund Freud . 	2.06647
Extrapyramidal syndrome is when involuntary muscle movements occur in the face and neck. This may include lip smacking, tongue movements, blinking, and head or finger spasms . The patient may have difficulty moving his arms and legs, and slur their words. It occurs when dopamine is not correctly regulated by the body. It is usually a reaction to medicines , but is also caused by Parkinson's disease or a head injury .	Extrapyramidal symptoms , also known as extrapyramidal side effects  are drug-induced movement disorders, which include acute and long-term symptoms. These symptoms include dystonia , akathisia ,  parkinsonism characteristic symptoms such as rigidity , bradykinesia , tremor , and tardive dyskinesia .  Extrapyramidal symptoms are a reason why subjects drop out of clinical trials of antipsychotics; of the 213  subjects that dropped out of one of the largest clinical trials of antipsychotics , which included 1460 randomized subjects), 58  of those discontinuations were due to EPS.  Extrapyramidal symptoms are most commonly caused by typical antipsychotic drugs that antagonize dopamine D2 receptors.  The most common typical antipsychotics associated with EPS are haloperidol and fluphenazine .  Atypical antipsychotics have lower D2 receptor affinity or higher serotonin 5-HT2A receptor affinity which lead to lower rates of EPS.  Other anti-dopaminergic drugs, like the antiemetic metoclopramide , can also result in extrapyramidal side effects.  Short and long-term use of antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors , serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors , and norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitors  have also resulted in EPS.  Specifically, duloxetine , sertraline , escitalopram , fluoxetine , and bupropion have been linked to the induction of EPS. 	2.065051
A persistent vegetative state is what happens when a person in a coma becomes somewhat aware of what is happening around them.  However, they have little or no control over their body.  Most people who are in a PVS cannot live without medicine or machinery, such as a ventilator .	A persistent vegetative state  or post-coma unresponsiveness   is a disorder of consciousness in which patients with severe brain damage are in a state of partial arousal rather than true awareness . After four weeks in a vegetative state , the patient is classified as in a persistent vegetative state. This diagnosis is classified as a permanent vegetative state some months  after a non-traumatic brain injury or one year after a traumatic injury. Today, doctors and neuroscientists prefer to call the state of consciousness a syndrome ,  primarily because of ethical questions about whether a patient can be called "vegetative" or not.  There are several definitions that vary by technical versus layman's usage. There are different legal implications in different countries. A wakeful unconscious state that lasts longer than a few weeks is referred to as a persistent  vegetative state. 	2.0519023
Pain is a symptom of being hurt or sick. It is a bad sensation that is physical and emotional. Most pain starts when part of the body is hurt. Nerves in that part send messages to the brain . Those messages tell the brain that the body is being damaged . Pain is not just the message the nerve sends to the brain. It is the bad emotion felt because of that damage. The message that the nerve sends to the brain is called nociception . What is experienced because of the nociception is pain. Pain can be acute or chronic . Acute means it only happens a short time. Chronic means the pain lasts a long time.	Pain is a distressing feeling often caused by intense or damaging stimuli. The International Association for the Study of Pain defines pain as "an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with, or resembling that associated with, actual or potential tissue damage."  In medical diagnosis, pain is regarded as a symptom of an underlying condition. Pain motivates the individual to withdraw from damaging situations, to protect a damaged body part while it heals, and to avoid similar experiences in the future.  Most pain resolves once the noxious stimulus is removed and the body has healed, but it may persist despite removal of the stimulus and apparent healing of the body. Sometimes pain arises in the absence of any detectable stimulus, damage or disease. 	2.042207
A headache is when your head hurts. It is not when you hit your head with something and made it hurt that way, but when your head hurts from inside. A headache can be caused by one of several things, which are listed here: The second edition of the International Headache Classification  defines more than 220 different types of headaches in three categories:  Many headaches can be relieved with analgesics like aspirin .	Headache is the symptom of pain in the face , head , or neck . It can occur as a migraine , tension-type headache , or cluster headache . There is an increased risk of depression in those with severe headaches.  Headaches can occur as a result of many conditions. There are a number of different classification systems for headaches. The most well-recognized is that of the International Headache Society . Causes of headaches may include dehydration, fatigue, sleep deprivation, stress, the effects of medications, the effects of recreational drugs, viral infections, loud noises, common colds, head injury, rapid ingestion of a very cold food or beverage, and dental or sinus issues .  Treatment of a headache depends on the underlying cause, but commonly involves pain medication . A headache is one of the most commonly experienced of all physical discomforts.	2.0361621

There is an increased risk of depression in those with severe headaches.  Headaches can occur as a result of many conditions. There are a number of different classification systems for headaches. The most well-recognized is that of the International Headache Society . Causes of headaches may include dehydration, fatigue, sleep deprivation, stress, the effects of medications, the effects of recreational drugs, viral infections, loud noises, common colds, head injury, rapid ingestion of a very cold food or beverage, and dental or sinus issues .  Treatment of a headache depends on the underlying cause, but commonly involves pain medication . A headache is one of the most commonly experienced of all physical discomforts.	2.0361621
A chemical burn is an uncomfortable sensation caused by the destruction of body tissue. It is destroyed by various chemicals. For example, concentrated sulfuric acid makes very bad chemical burns.  Hydrochloric acid makes milder burns.  There are several ways to protect against chemical burns, such as wearing gloves and a lab apron when working with chemicals. Each chemical has its own way to remove it from the skin, but normally drenching the burn with water should help.	A chemical burn occurs when living tissue is exposed to a corrosive substance  or a cytotoxic agent . Chemical burns follow standard burn classification and may cause extensive tissue damage. The main types of irritant and/or corrosive products are: acids, bases, oxidizers / reducing agents, solvents , and alkylants. Additionally, chemical burns can be caused by some types of cytotoxic chemical weapons , e.g., vesicants such as mustard gas and Lewisite , or urticants such as phosgene oxime . Chemical burns may: The exact symptoms of a chemical burn depend on the chemical involved. Symptoms include itching, bleaching or darkening of skin, burning sensations, trouble breathing , coughing blood and/or tissue necrosis . Common sources of chemical burns include sulfuric acid , hydrochloric acid  , sodium hydroxide , lime , silver nitrate , and hydrogen peroxide .  Effects depend on the substance; hydrogen peroxide removes a bleached layer of skin, while nitric acid causes a characteristic color change to yellow in the skin, and silver nitrate produces noticeable black stains.  Chemical burns may occur through direct contact on body surfaces, including skin and eyes, via inhalation, and/or by ingestion. Lipophilic substances that diffuse efficiently in human tissue, e.g., hydrofluoric acid , sulfur mustard , and dimethyl sulfate , may not react immediately, but instead produce the burns and inflammation hours after the contact. Chemical fabrication , mining , medicine , and related professional fields are examples of occupations where chemical burns may occur.  Hydrofluoric acid leaches into the bloodstream, reacts with calcium and magnesium, and the resulting salts can cause cardiac arrest after eating through skin.	2.0329049
Black Thursday  was a global stock market crash on March 12, 2020 as part of the greater 2020 stock market crash . Global stock markets suffered the greatest single-day fall since the 1987 stock market crash .  Following Black Monday three days earlier, Black Thursday was caused by the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic and a lack of investor confidence in United States President Donald Trump after he added a 30-day travel ban against the Schengen Area . 	The 2020 stock market crash was a major and sudden global stock market crash that began on 20 February 2020 and ended on 7 April. Beginning on 13 May 2019, the yield curve on U.S. Treasury securities inverted ,  and remained so until 11 October 2019, when it reverted to normal .  Through 2019, while some economists  argued that a recession in the following year was likely,   other economists  argued that inverted yield curves may no longer be a reliable recession predictor.   The yield curve on U.S. Treasuries would not invert again until 30 January 2020 when the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern ,   four weeks after local health commission officials in Wuhan , China announced the first 27 COVID-19 cases as a viral pneumonia strain outbreak on 1 January . 	2.0244353

Death by natural causes is often recorded on death records as the cause of a person's death . Death from natural causes might be a heart attack , stroke , cancer, infection, or any other illness . By contrast, death caused by active intervention is known as unnatural death . The "unnatural" causes are usually given as accident , misadventure , suicide, or homicide .  In some settings, other categories may be added.  For example, a prison may track the deaths of inmates caused by acute intoxication separately.  Additionally, a cause of death can be recorded as "undetermined". 	In many legal jurisdictions , the manner of death is a determination, typically made by the coroner , medical examiner , police, or similar officials, and recorded as a vital statistic .  Within the United States and the United Kingdom, a distinction is made between the cause of death , which is a specific disease or injury, versus manner of death, which is primarily a legal determination. Different categories are used in different jurisdictions, but manner of death determinations include everything from very broad categories like "natural" and "homicide" to specific manners like "traffic accident" or "gunshot wound".  In some cases an autopsy is performed, either due to general legal requirements, because the medical cause of death is uncertain, upon the request of family members or guardians, or because the circumstances of death were suspicious. International Classification of Disease  codes can be used to record manner and cause of death in a systematic way that makes it easy to compile statistics and more feasible to compare events across jurisdictions.  A death by natural causes results from an illness or an internal malfunction of the body not directly caused by external forces, other than infectious disease .  For example, a person dying from complications from influenza and/or pneumonia , a stroke , a heart attack , or sudden heart failure would most likely be listed as having died from natural causes.  "Death by natural causes" is sometimes used as a euphemism for "dying of old age", which is considered problematic as a cause of death ; there are also many non-age-related causes of "natural" death, for legal manner-of-death purposes.  	2.011231
A clinical trial is one of the steps needed to introduce a new drug or therapy . Depending on the drug, either volunteers or patients suffering from a disease or condition are enrolled in a study. In general, a number of the people taking part will receive the real drug, or a good treatment, and the rest of the people will receive a treatment or drug that has no effect, called a placebo . These tests are statistical tests . Examples of study designs: Clinical trials were first introduced in Avicenna 's The Canon of Medicine in 1025 AD, where he laid down rules for the experimental use and testing of drugs . He wrote a precise guide for practical experimentation in the process of discovering and proving the effectiveness of medical drugs and substances .  He laid out the following rules and principles for testing the effectiveness of new drugs and medications , which still form the basis of modern clinical trials:   One of the most famous clinical trials was James Lind 's demonstration in 1747 that citrus fruits cure scurvy .  He compared the effects of various different acidic substances, ranging from vinegar to cider, on groups of afflicted sailors, and found that the group who were given oranges and lemons had largely recovered from scurvy after 6 days.	Clinical trials are experiments or observations done in clinical research . Such prospective biomedical or behavioral research studies on human participants are designed to answer specific questions about biomedical or behavioral interventions, including new treatments  and known interventions that warrant further study and comparison. Clinical trials generate data on dosage, safety and efficacy .  They are conducted only after they have received health authority/ethics committee approval in the country where approval of the therapy is sought. These authorities are responsible for vetting the risk/benefit ratio of the trial—their approval does not mean the therapy is 'safe' or effective, only that the trial may be conducted. Depending on product type and development stage, investigators initially enroll volunteers or patients into small pilot studies , and subsequently conduct progressively larger scale comparative studies. Clinical trials can vary in size and cost, and they can involve a single research center or multiple centers , in one country or in multiple countries. Clinical study design aims to ensure the scientific validity and reproducibility of the results.	2.0096457
The word benign is often used to refer to a medical condition that will not become life-threatening if it is not treated , but can also mean that something is not harmful .  It is often used in relation to tumours that do not metastasise to other parts of the body .  Tumours that are referred to as being benign may still be life-threatening because of other reasons.  Because of this, the term applies mainly to their biological behaviour. Tumors that are benign may be at risk of changing into malignancy .  These are termed " premalignant ".	Benignity  is any condition that is harmless in the long run. The opposite of benignity is malignity .	1.9868908

Cryonics  is the process of vitrifying a human  about −196 degrees Celsius  after a doctor says they are dead. People do that in hope that, in the future when medicine becomes better, they can have life again, solve their health problems and have eternal life . Cold people like this are not awake at all as they have no brain activity . The law also says they are dead. Their body and its brain are made more like glass than ice because ice would harm their cells more. To do this, their blood is replaced with chemicals called cryoprotectants , which act like anti-freeze . There are five big cryonics companies:	Cryonics  is the low-temperature freezing  and storage of a human corpse or severed head, with the speculative hope that resurrection may be possible in the future.   Cryonics is regarded with skepticism within the mainstream scientific community. It is generally viewed as a pseudoscience ,  and its practice has been characterized as quackery .   Cryonics procedures can begin only after clinical death , and cryonics "patients" are legally dead . Cryonics procedures may begin within minutes of death,  and use cryoprotectants to prevent ice formation during cryopreservation.  It is, however, not possible for a corpse to be reanimated after undergoing vitrification , as this causes damage to the brain including its neural networks .  The first corpse to be frozen was that of Dr. James Bedford in 1967.  As of 2014, about 250 dead bodies had been cryopreserved in the United States , and 1,500 people had made arrangements for cryopreservation of their corpses. 	1.970859
Bacteria are used to test the effectiveness of disinfectants and antibiotics . Therefore, it is important that bacteria are not contaminated with other microorganisms . To prevent contamination, aseptic techniques are used. These include:	Asepsis is the state of being free from disease-causing micro-organisms .  There are two categories of asepsis: medical and surgical.  The modern day notion of asepsis is derived from the older antiseptic techniques, a shift initiated by different individuals in the 19th century who introduced practices such as the sterilizing of surgical tools and the wearing of surgical gloves during operations.  The goal of asepsis is to eliminate infection, not to achieve sterility.  Ideally, a surgical field is sterile , meaning it is free of all biological contaminants , not just those that can cause disease, putrefaction , or fermentation .  Even in an aseptic state, a condition of sterile inflammation may develop. The term often refers to those practices used to promote or induce asepsis in an operative field of surgery or medicine to prevent infection .  The modern concept of asepsis evolved in the 19th century through multiple individuals. Ignaz Semmelweis showed that hand washing prior to delivery reduced puerperal fever . Despite this, many hospitals continued to practice surgery in unsanitary conditions, wit h some surgeons taking pride in their bloodstained operating gowns.  It was not until after reading of the findings by Louis Pasteur that Joseph Lister introduced the use of carbolic acid as an antiseptic, and in doing so, reduced surgical infection rates.  Lawson Tait shifted the movement then from antisepsis to asepsis, instilling practices such as a strict no-talking policy within his operating room and drastically limiting the number of people to come in contact with a patient's wound.  Ernst von Bergmann also introduced the autoclave , a device used for the practice of the sterilization of surgical instruments.  But, everything from operating room uniforms to gloves was pioneered by William Halsted . Preceding modern-day scrubs attire, Halsted implemented a no street clothes policy in his operating room, opting to wear a completely white, sterile uniform consisting of a duck suit , tennis shoes , and skullcap .  This helped to prevent the introduction of infections into open wounds.  Additionally, Halsted would sterilize the operation site with alcohol, iodine and other disinfectants and use drapes to cover all areas except for the site.  In his department at Johns Hopkins Hospital , he enforced an extreme hand washing ritual consisting of soaking in harmfully strong chemicals like permanganate and mercury bichloride solution as well as scrubbing with stiff brushes.  The damage to a surgical nurse's hands compelled him to create the earliest form of the surgical gloves with the Goodyear Rubber Company .  These gloves became a part of the aseptic surgery standard when Dr. Joseph Colt Bloodgood and several others began wearing them for that particular purpose. 	1.8763207

A diagnosis is an accurate and precise account of the nature or cause of something. Medical diagnosis is the best-known field, but diagnosis can be applied to any subject. Whereas a doctor diagnoses what is wrong with a patient, a motor mechanic can diagnose the fault in a car. In all cases they replace a vague query, such as "My car will not start", with an exact analysis , such as "It's out of petrol". Notice the diagnosis is precise enough so the solution can be seen. These ideas work even in more subtle cases. A boy brings an insect in a box to a natural history museum. He asks an expert "What is this?" The expert says "You mean, apart from it being a beetle ?" When the boy nods, the expert looks at the insect under a magnifying glass, or a binocular microscope . Chances are, it is a common beetle, and the expert can give the boy quite a lot of information about it. But if it is not known to the expert, a much longer study is needed. Large reference books will be consulted; trays of similar insects will be taken out of store to be compared. A full diagnosis needs at least the genus and species . If the species is unknown, the detailed work of description is needed for publication.	Diagnosis is the identification of the nature and cause of a certain phenomenon. Diagnosis is used in many different disciplines , with variations in the use of logic , analytics , and experience, to determine " cause and effect ". In systems engineering and computer science , it is typically used to determine the causes of symptoms, mitigations, and solutions. 	1.8623569
Mental confusion  is a symptom . People suffering from it have problems finding their way around in the world. They have troubles remembering who they are, where they are, or what time  it is. Additionally, they may have trouble remembering things or memorizing new things. This may be linked to problems focusing their attention. Confusion can also be a sign of someone being sick with various illnesses when it's coupled with things like fever, chills, or exhaustion. Confusion can be caused by many different medical problems. There are both acute and chronic causes of confusion. Acute causes of confusion usually come on suddenly, and doctors may be able to fix some of them.	In medicine, confusion is the quality or state of being bewildered or unclear. The term "acute mental confusion"  is often used interchangeably with delirium  in the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems and the Medical Subject Headings publications to describe the pathology . These refer to the loss of orientation , or the ability to place oneself correctly in the world by time, location and personal identity. Mental confusion is sometimes accompanied by disordered consciousness  and memory loss .  The term is from Latin : confusĭo, -ōnis , from confundere : "to pour together", "to mingle together", "to confuse". Confusion may result from drug side effects or from a relatively sudden brain dysfunction.  Acute confusion is often called delirium ,  although delirium often includes a much broader array of disorders than simple confusion.  These disorders include the inability to focus attention; various impairments in awareness, and temporal or spatial dis-orientation.  Mental confusion can result from chronic organic brain pathologies, such as dementia  , as well.	1.8566027
A risk factor in medicine is something that causes, or helps to cause, a medical condition.  For example, smoking or breathing in somebody else's tobacco smoke  is a risk factor for emphysema and lung cancer . A trigger factor causes the symptoms of a medical condition to begin in a person who already has that medical condition. Example: Smoking or breathing in someone else's smoke can be a trigger factor for asthma. The person already had asthma but the smoke caused an asthma attack. 		1.8001604

Medical abbreviations are a shorthand way of writing and talking by medical professionals  to hurry explanation of diseases , patients, or medicines . This shorthand can include shortening  of longer disease names, by cutting the word down to its base . Medical professionals also create  words that mean something. An example of this is "stat", used to indicate  that something needs to be hurried . It is from the Latin "base word" statim, meaning quick. A very commonly  used shorthand is shortening things on order forms for patients. An example is, "pre-op" meaning |pre-operation| . These can be very complicated and extensive . Despite the fact that this shorthand might make it difficult for new Interns  or recently trained nurses to get used to this unofficial language, it has been shown to improve  the speed of treatment in hospitals. Medical authorities in the United Kingdom and elsewhere have questioned the use of medical shorthand; believing that it can lead to mistakes being made due to less clear communication and have advised doctors to avoid its use. 	0–9 A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z Abbreviations are used very frequently in medicine. They boost efficiency as long as they are used intelligently. The advantages of brevity should be weighed against the possibilities of obfuscation  and ambiguity . Certain medical abbreviations are avoided to prevent mistakes, according to best practices ; these are flagged in the list of abbreviations used in medical prescriptions . Periods  are often used in styling abbreviations. Prevalent practice in medicine today is often to  forego them as unnecessary.	1.7283337
A disability is a condition that a person has which limits them in some way. People with a disability or disabilities may need to use special equipment that can help them. This can include using a wheelchair , a cane or walking stick, hearing aids , a teletypewriter  and using specially designed software and hardware for the personal computer . People who use a wheelchair or cane/walking stick cannot walk up or down stairs in a building. They need to use ramps and elevators when going into and moving around in a building. Wide doorways and accessible toilets also make it easier for people with physical disabilities to use. Prejudice towards people with disabilities is common. This is sometimes called ' ableism ' or anapirism. People with such a prejudice are called an ablecentrists , handicapists, anapirophobes, able-bodyists, disablists or anapirists. 	A disability is any medical condition that makes it more difficult for a person to do certain activities or effectively interact with the world around them . These conditions, or impairments, may be cognitive , developmental , intellectual , mental , physical , sensory , or a combination of multiple factors. Impairments causing disability may be present from birth or occur during a person's lifetime. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities defines disability as: long-term physical, mental, intellectual or sensory impairments which in interaction with various barriers may hinder  full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others. 	1.669634
A disease or medical condition is an unhealthy state where something bad happens to the body or mind .  Diseases can cause pain , parts of the body to stop working the right way, or death. The word disease is sometimes used to include: A disease can be caused by many things.  Sometimes germs enter our body through food, water or air.  A person can be infected by infectious agents like bacteria , viruses or fungus . Disease can also be caused by eating bad or old foods . There are small germs in old foods that can cause diseases. Sometimes the germs produce chemicals or toxins which causes the disease. One of the most common causes of disease is poor sanitation and lack of clean water.  Some deadly diseases like malaria in tropical parts of the world are spread by a mosquito .  Animals that spread disease are called vectors . There are many vectors, including snails, ticks, and fleas. Some people are born with ' genetic diseases'. These are diseases because of an error or mutation in a person's DNA . An example of a mutation is cancer . Living or working in an unhealthy environment can also be a cause for diseases. Diseases are more common in older people.	A disease is a particular abnormal condition that negatively affects the structure or function of all or part of an organism, and that is not due to any immediate external injury.   Diseases are often known to be medical conditions that are associated with specific signs and symptoms . A disease may be caused by external factors such as pathogens or by internal dysfunctions.  For example, internal dysfunctions of the immune system can produce a variety of different diseases, including various forms of immunodeficiency , hypersensitivity , allergies and autoimmune disorders . In humans, disease is often used more broadly to refer to any condition that causes pain , dysfunction , distress , social problems , or death to the person afflicted, or similar problems for those in contact with the person. In this broader sense, it sometimes includes injuries , disabilities , disorders , syndromes , infections , isolated symptoms , deviant behaviors , and atypical variations of structure and function, while in other contexts and for other purposes these may be considered distinguishable categories. Diseases can affect people not only physically, but also mentally, as contracting and living with a disease can alter the affected person's perspective on life.	1.6404202

Psychopathology is the study of mental illnesses . It was started by Karl Jaspers in 1913.	Psychopathology is the study of abnormal cognitions, behaviour and experiences which differs according to social norms and rests upon a number of constructs that are deemed to be the social norm at any particular era. It can be broadly separated into descriptive and explanatory.  Descriptive psychopathology involves categorizing, defining and understanding symptoms as reported by people and observed through their behavior which are then assessed according to a social norm.  Explanatory psychopathology looks to find explanations for certain kinds of symptoms according to theoretical models such as psychodynamics , cognitive behavioral therapy or through understanding how they have been constructed by drawing upon Constructivist Grounded Theory  or Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis .  A practitioner in a clinical or academic field is referred to as a psychopathologist . Biological psychopathology is the study of the biological etiology of abnormal cognitions, behavior and experiences. Child psychopathology is a specialization applied to children and adolescents. Animal psychopathology is a specialization applied to non-human animals. This concept is linked to the philosophical ideas first outlined by Galton  and is linked to the appliance of eugenical ideations around what constitutes the human. Early explanations for mental illnesses were influenced by religious belief and superstition . Psychological conditions that are now classified as mental disorders were initially attributed to possessions by evil spirits, demons, and the devil. This idea was widely accepted up until the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Individuals who suffered from these so-called "possessions" were tortured as treatment or as Foucault outlines in the History of Madness: viewed as seers .  Religious practitioners used this technique in hoping to bring their patients back to sanity but increasingly there was the shift to the great confinement.  	1.5581505
Blood draw is when blood gets taken from a vein using a hypodermic needle . It is stored in special blood bottles. These bottles are called vacutainers . There is usually a liquid or mist in the bottle that moves blood inside it.	In medicine, venipuncture or venepuncture is the process of obtaining intravenous access for the purpose of venous blood sampling  or intravenous therapy . In healthcare, this procedure is performed by medical laboratory scientists , medical practitioners , some EMTs , paramedics , phlebotomists , dialysis technicians, and other nursing staff.  In veterinary medicine , the procedure is performed by veterinarians and veterinary technicians . It is essential to follow a standard procedure for the collection of blood specimens to get accurate laboratory results. Any error in collecting the blood or filling the test tubes may lead to erroneous laboratory results.  Venipuncture is one of the most routinely performed invasive procedures and is carried out for any of five reasons:	1.5533521
Prophylaxis is a Greek word and concept . It means any action taken to guard or prevent beforehand . The corresponding adjective is prophylactic . The concept of prophylaxis has two parts. First is forethought . A person has to realise the need first of all. Second is taking appropriate action . Any failure of prophylaxis is a failure at either stage 1 or stage 2. Successful prophylaxis means one has anticipated and avoided some undesirable outcome . Prophylaxis is the central idea in preventative medicine . People usually think medical treatment helps sick people to get healthy. Prophylactic treatment is helpful in a different way. Primary prophylaxis tries to stop healthy people from getting sick. Secondary prophylaxis tries to stop people who are sick from getting worse.	Preventive healthcare , or prophylaxis , consists of measures taken for disease prevention.  Disease and disability are affected by environmental factors , genetic predisposition , disease agents, and lifestyle choices and are dynamic processes which begin before individuals realize they are affected. Disease prevention relies on anticipatory actions that can be categorized as primal,   primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention.  Each year, millions of people die of preventable deaths. A 2004 study showed that about half of all deaths in the United States in 2000 were due to preventable behaviors and exposures.  Leading causes included cardiovascular disease , chronic respiratory disease , unintentional injuries, diabetes , and certain infectious diseases.  This same study estimates that 400,000 people die each year in the United States due to poor diet and a sedentary lifestyle .  According to estimates made by the World Health Organization , about 55 million people died worldwide in 2011, two thirds of this group from non-communicable diseases, including cancer , diabetes , and chronic cardiovascular and lung diseases .  This is an increase from the year 2000, during which 60% of deaths were attributed to these diseases.  Preventive healthcare is especially important given the worldwide rise in prevalence of chronic diseases and deaths from these diseases. There are many methods for prevention of disease. One of them is prevention of teenage smoking through information giving.     It is recommended that adults and children aim to visit their doctor for regular check-ups, even if they feel healthy, to perform disease screening , identify risk factors for disease, discuss tips for a healthy and balanced lifestyle, stay up to date with immunizations and boosters, and maintain a good relationship with a healthcare provider.  In pediatrics, some common examples of primary prevention are encouraging parents to turn down the temperature of their home water heater in order to avoid scalding burns, encouraging children to wear bicycle helmets, and suggesting that people use the Air Quality Index  to check the level of pollution in the outside air before engaging in sporting activities.  Some common disease screenings include checking for hypertension , hyperglycemia , hypercholesterolemia , screening for colon cancer , depression , HIV and other common types of sexually transmitted disease such as chlamydia , syphilis , and gonorrhea , mammography , colorectal cancer screening, a Pap test , and screening for osteoporosis . Genetic testing can also be performed to screen for mutations that cause genetic disorders or predisposition to certain diseases such as breast or ovarian cancer .  However, these measures are not affordable for every individual and the cost effectiveness of preventive healthcare is still a topic of debate.  	1.5510285
COVID-19 testing can help find the SARS-CoV-2 virus. There are two types of test; one can find the virus  and the other that can find antibodies produced in response to infection . An accurate mortality rate of the disease and the level of herd immunity in the population can be found from the results of these tests. However, it is still not known how long immunity will last, and how effective it will be.  Due to limited testing, as of March 2020, no countries had reliable data of the virus.

Mass hysteria is a phenomenon when a large group of people share a common emotion .  This emotion can be positive, such as people being euphoric at a rock concert, or it can be negative, like after a great person or statesman died. It was first used by the Quarteerly Christian Spectator in 1830, to describe an outbreak of cholera . 	Mass psychogenic illness , also called mass sociogenic illness , mass psychogenic disorder , epidemic hysteria , or mass hysteria , is the rapid spread of illness signs and symptoms affecting members of a cohesive group, originating from a nervous system disturbance involving excitation, loss, or alteration of function, whereby physical complaints that are exhibited unconsciously have no corresponding organic aetiology .  Mass psychogenic illness involves the spread of illness symptoms through a population where there is no infectious agent responsible for contagion.  MPI is distinct from other types of collective delusions by involving physical symptoms.  According to Balaratnasingam and Janca, "Mass hysteria is to date a poorly understood condition. Little certainty exists regarding its etiology."  Qualities of MPI outbreaks often include:  British psychiatrist Simon Wesseley distinguishes between two forms of MPI: 	1.48581
Symptoms are used in diagnosis . The term is used in medicine , and in other fields such as fault-finding in engineering . In medicine, it refers to things the patient feels or notices. It contrasts with signs , which are changes which a doctor sees in a patient. What a patient feels is subjective , whereas what a doctor sees is objective . In diagnosis, all symptoms and signs are brought together to make a hypothesis as to what is going wrong. This might suggest further investigation or treatment. A complete investigation ends with a diagnosis that  summarizes all this.	Signs and symptoms are the observed or detectable signs, and experienced symptoms of an illness,  injury, or condition.  A sign for example may be a higher or lower temperature than normal,  raised or lowered blood pressure or an abnormality showing on a medical scan .  A  symptom is something out of the ordinary that is experienced by an individual such as feeling feverish, a headache  or other pain or pains in the body.   A medical sign is an objective indication of a disease, injury, or abnormal physiological state that may be detected during a physical examination .  These signs are visible or otherwise detectable such as a rash or bruise . Medical signs assist in arriving at an accurate diagnosis . Examples of signs include elevated blood pressure , nail clubbing of the fingernails or toenails, staggering gait , and arcus senilis and arcus juvenilis of the eyes. A sign is distinguished from an indication which is a specific reason for using a particular treatment . A symptom is something felt or experienced, such as pain or dizziness. Signs and symptoms are not mutually exclusive, for example a subjective feeling of fever can be noted as sign by using a thermometer that registers a high reading.  Signs and symptoms are often non-specific, but some combinations can be suggestive of certain diagnoses , helping to narrow down what may be wrong. A particular set of characteristic signs and symptoms that may be associated with a disorder is known as a syndrome . In cases where the underlying cause is known the syndrome is named as for example Down syndrome and Noonan syndrome . Other syndromes such as acute coronary syndrome may have a number of possible causes.	1.4461181

Suffering is pain or mental or emotional unhappiness caused by bad things happening, like disasters or illness . It is an important topic in philosophy , and religion . Much health care exists to help people who are suffering.	Suffering , or pain in a broad sense,  may be an experience of unpleasantness and aversion associated with the perception of harm or threat of harm in an individual.  Suffering is the basic element that makes up the negative valence of affective phenomena . The opposite of suffering is pleasure or happiness . Suffering is often categorized as physical  or mental.  It may come in all degrees of intensity, from mild to intolerable. Factors of duration and frequency of occurrence usually compound that of intensity. Attitudes toward suffering may vary widely, in the sufferer or other people, according to how much it is regarded as avoidable or unavoidable, useful or useless, deserved or undeserved. Suffering occurs in the lives of sentient beings in numerous manners, often dramatically. As a result, many fields of human activity are concerned with some aspects of suffering. These aspects may include the nature of suffering, its processes, its origin and causes, its meaning and significance, its related personal, social, and cultural behaviors,  its remedies, management, and uses.	1.4351363
A COVID-19 vaccine is any of the vaccines used against the Coronavirus Disease 2019 . In July 2020, more than 150 vaccines were being developed in different laboratories.  Two mRNA vaccines , one by Pfizer and one by Moderna , were approved late in 2020. Both are over 90% effective.  A few vaccines also went into use in early 2021. Several countries plan to give the vaccine to many people, but their plans are different. The United Kingdom plans to use its National Health Service .  Canada plans to use its military. The United States plans to send vaccines to all fifty states and then let the state governments each make their own system.  The United Kingdom approved the Pfizer vaccine before the European Union or United States did. They began giving it to people on December 8.  The United States began giving people the vaccine on December 14, starting with health care workers in New York City .  By April 2021, several vaccines were in use around the world and hundreds of millions of people had been vaccinated. In late February 2020, the World Health Organization  said it did not expect a vaccine against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 , the causative virus, to become available in less than 18 months.  The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations  – which is organizing a US$2 billion worldwide fund for fast investment and creation of vaccine candidates  – indicated in April that a vaccine may be available under emergency use protocols in less than 12 months or by early 2021.  On 4 May 2020, the WHO organized a telethon  to raise US$8 billion from forty countries to support rapid development of vaccines to prevent COVID-19 infections and deaths.  The United States government started Operation Warp Speed to develop a vaccine by January 2021. 	2020 2021	1.4244835

In common usage, they also form words that describe dislike or hatred of a particular thing or subject . The suffix is antonymic to -phil- .	1.366827
The Farmers to Families Food Box program is set up by the United States ' government during the COVID-19 pandemic to help get fresh food from farmers to consumers. The food is put into "family-sized" boxes containing produce, dairy products and/or meat. The programs is run by the USDA .  It is part of the government's general response to the pandemic, called the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program  run by the USDA.  It was announced on April 15, 2020. According to the program's home page, over 70,000,000 boxes were invoiced between the start date and then end of August.  As of the second week of August 2020, the program's budget was three billion dollars.  The USDA buys the produce from farmers. Then the food is sent to local packaging companies.  These companies distribute the packages to local organizations such as NGOs and religious orga nizations. The program sets no restrictions on which families may pick of the boxes.  The program has been positively received.  However, there has been some criticism.  For example, the boxes weigh forty pounds.  This can make it difficult for people without a car to get the boxes home.  Also, the program initially only had boxes with produce, dairy products and meat.  Since some people do not eat dairy or meat products, this created a problem.  It has also been stated that specialty-crop farmers have not been helped enough by the program. 		1.3609896

Mental capacity in law is a term used to describe a person's ability to make decisions for themselves and to understand what those decisions will mean for them. Sometimes, people who are unwell, such as those with illnesses which affect their memory , those with learning difficulties , or who have mental health problems, may find themselves in a position where their ability to make decisions for themselves is questioned.  This may be because they do not understand that what they are doing is not good for them; they do not realise that it might make them ill or get them into trouble. People can also lack capacity if they are unable to communicate in any way; for example, if they're in a coma or if they have severe brain damage .  In this case, it may be necessary for someone else, such as an advocate or a Judge to make decisions for them by making a court order . In some countries, like the United Kingdom , laws exist which tell those working with people whose capacity might be in doubt, what they must do and how to decide if someone is capable of making their own decisions.  In the UK, this law is called the Mental Capacity Act .  It lists 5 rules which must be used as a guide; in simple terms, they are:	Intelligence has been defined in many ways: the capacity for logic , understanding , self-awareness , learning , emotional knowledge , reasoning , planning , creativity , critical thinking , and problem-solving . More generally, it can be described as the ability to perceive or infer information , and to retain it as knowledge to be applied towards adaptive behaviors within an environment or context. Intelligence is most often studied in humans but has also been observed in both non-human animals and in plants despite controversy as to whether some of these forms of life exhibit intelligence.   Intelligence in computers or other machines is called artificial intelligence . The word intelligence derives from the Latin nouns intelligentia or intellēctus , which in turn stem from the verb intelligere , to comprehend or perceive. In the Middle Ages , the word intellectus became the scholarly technical term for understanding, and a translation for the Greek philosophical term nous . This term, however, was strongly linked to the metaphysical and cosmological theories of teleological scholasticism , including theories of the immortality of the soul, and the concept of the active intellect . This approach to the study of nature was strongly rejected by the early modern philosophers such as Francis Bacon , Thomas Hobbes , John Locke , and David Hume , all of whom preferred "understanding"  in their English philosophical works.   Hobbes for example, in his Latin De Corpore , used " intellectus intelligit ", translated in the English version as "the understanding understandeth", as a typical example of a logical absurdity .  "Intelligence" has therefore become less common in English language philosophy, but it has later been taken up  in more contemporary psychology . 	1.302391

Coronavirus disease 2019  is an infectious disease caused by SARS coronavirus 2  ,  a virus closely related to the SARS virus .    The disease is the cause of the COVID-19 pandemic .   Those who get the disease might get a fever , dry cough , fatigue  and shortness of breath. A sore throat, runny nose or sneezing is less common. In very bad cases, they can even get a much worse fever, fewer white blood cells , and loss of appetite. They might cough up blood, and have kidney failure . People with this disease can get pneumonia and multi-organ failure if they are weak, old, or are already sick.   There are people who are called asymptomatic carriers , which means that they did not have all or some of the symptoms of the virus. This is very dangerous since they may not know that they have the virus and can give it to other people without knowing it. The countries with the most sick people are the USA, India and Brazil. COVID-19 virus travels from person to person through the air like the common cold does. Scientists think the virus is not able to hang in the air a long time and go far like the measles virus does. 		1.225649

The coronavirus recession , also known as the Great Lockdown  or Great Shutdown ,  is an ongoing major global economic recession affecting the world economy in early 2020    during the COVID-19 pandemic .   The recession has caused the largest economic downturn since the Great Depression .  On 14 April 2020, the International Monetary Fund  reported that all of the G7 nations had already entered or were entering into what was called a "deep recession".  The IMF has stated that the economic decline is "far worse" than that of the Great Recession in 2009.     The pandemic has led to more than a third of the world's population being placed on lockdown to stop the spread of COVID-19 .  This has caused severe economic downfalls for economies across the world,  following soon after a global economic slowdown during 2019 that saw a lowering numbers in stock markets worldwide.   The United Nations  predicted in April 2020 that global unemployment will wipe out 6.7 per cent of working hours globally in the second quarter of 2020—equivalent to 195 million full-time workers. 	2020 2021	0.90479165

The COVID-19 pandemic started in the city of Wuhan, China in December 2019. It has led to increased acts of prejudice , xenophobia , discrimination , racism and violence against people of Southeast Asian , Hispanic , East Asian , Native American , biracial and black people all over the world. With the spread of the pandemic and in formation of hotspots, like those in Asia , Europe and the Americas , discrimination against people from these hotspots was reported. According to the Embassy of Japan in Cairo , store clerks were hesitating to serve Japanese customers. "Corona" became a new slur by which to abuse Japanese people on the street.  On 10 March 2020, an Uber driver was arrested when a viral video forcibly removing a Chinese passenger in Cairo's Maadi district. The passenger was thought to have the coronavirus. The incident caused an uproar among Egyptians when the video was uploaded. Some Egyptians visited the Chinese man in his hotel room.  Violence toward foreign people was reported during the pandemic. Some local people attacked foreign people. The attackers published a number of photos of them under social media and linked them to the Covid-19. 	2020 2021	0.75536
