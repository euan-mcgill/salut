Medicine is the science [1] and practice [2] of caring for a patient and managing the diagnosis , prognosis , prevention , treatment or palliation of their injury or disease . Medicine encompasses a variety of health care practices evolved to maintain and restore health by the prevention and treatment of illness . Contemporary medicine applies biomedical sciences , biomedical research , genetics , and medical technology to diagnose , treat, and prevent injury and disease, typically through pharmaceuticals or surgery , but also through therapies as diverse as psychotherapy , external splints and traction , medical devices , biologics , and ionizing radiation , amongst others. [3]
Medicine has been practiced since prehistoric times , during most of which it was an art (an area of skill and knowledge) frequently having connections to the religious and philosophical beliefs of local culture. For example, a medicine man would apply herbs and say prayers for healing, or an ancient philosopher and physician would apply bloodletting according to the theories of humorism . In recent centuries, since the advent of modern science , most medicine has become a combination of art and science (both basic and applied , under the umbrella of medical science ). While stitching technique for sutures is an art learned through practice, the knowledge of what happens at the cellular and molecular level in the tissues being stitched arises through science.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1826%E2%80%931837_cholera_pandemic
The second cholera pandemic (1826–1837), also known as the Asiatic cholera pandemic , was a cholera pandemic that reached from India across western Asia to Europe , Great Britain , and the Americas , as well as east to China and Japan . [1] Cholera caused more deaths, more quickly, than any other epidemic disease in the 19th century [ citation needed ] .   The medical community now believes cholera to be exclusively a human disease, spread through many means of travel during the time, and transmitted through warm fecal-contaminated river waters and contaminated foods. During the second pandemic, the scientific community varied in its beliefs about the causes of cholera.
The first cholera pandemic (1817–24) began near Calcutta and spread throughout Southeast Asia to the Middle East, eastern Africa, and the Mediterranean coast. While cholera had spread across India many times previously, this outbreak went further; it reached as far as China and the Mediterranean Sea before receding. Hundreds of thousands of people died as a result of this pandemic , including many British soldiers , which attracted European attention. This was the first of several cholera pandemics to sweep through Asia and Europe during the 19th and 20th centuries. This first pandemic spread over an unprecedented range of territory, affecting almost every country in Asia. [ citation needed ]
Historians believe that the first pandemic had lingered in Indonesia and the Philippines in 1830. [ citation needed ]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020%E2%80%9321_H5N8_outbreak
In 2020 and 2021, an ongoing outbreak of Avian influenza subtype H5N8 has been occurring at poultry farms and among wild bird populations in several countries and continents, leading to the subsequent cullings of millions of birds to prevent a pandemic similar to that of the H5N1 outbreak in 2008 . The first case of human transmission was reported by Russian authorities in February 2021, as several poultry farm workers tested positive for the virus.
On 4 February 2020, Saudi Arabian government reported an outbreak of the highly pathogenic H5N8 virus on a poultry farm. The outbreak, which occurred in the central Sudair region, killed more than 22,000 birds in a few weeks. [1]
In the summer months, H5N8 was detected in wild birds in western Russia and Kazakhstan , because this included waterbirds that migrate into northern and western Europe, it was considered likely that the virus would be detected there later in the year (as would be confirmed in October–November). [2]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbott_Laboratories

Abbott Laboratories is an American multinational medical devices and health care company with headquarters in Abbott Park, Illinois , United States. The company was founded by Chicago physician Wallace Calvin Abbott in 1888 to formulate known drugs; today, it sells medical devices, diagnostics, branded generic medicines and nutritional products. It split off its research-based pharmaceuticals business into AbbVie in 2013.
Among its well-known products across the medical devices, diagnostics, and nutrition product divisions are Pedialyte , Similac , Ensure , Glucerna , ZonePerfect , FreeStyle Libre, i-STAT and MitraClip .
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_obesity
Abdominal obesity , also known as central obesity and truncal obesity , is a condition when excessive abdominal fat around the stomach and abdomen has built up to the extent that it is likely to have a negative impact on health. Abdominal obesity has been strongly linked to cardiovascular disease , [1] Alzheimer's disease , and other metabolic and vascular diseases . [2]
Visceral and central abdominal fat and waist circumference show a strong association with type 2 diabetes . [3]
Visceral fat , also known as organ fat or intra-abdominal fat , is located inside the peritoneal cavity , packed in between internal organs and torso , as opposed to subcutaneous fat , which is found underneath the skin , and intramuscular fat , which is found interspersed in skeletal muscle . Visceral fat is composed of several adipose depots including mesenteric , epididymal white adipose tissue (EWAT), and perirenal fat . An excess of adipose visceral fat is known as central obesity, the "pot belly" or "beer belly" effect, in which the abdomen protrudes excessively. This body type is also known as "apple shaped", as opposed to "pear shaped" in which fat is deposited on the hips and buttocks.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_pain

Abdominal pain , also known as a stomach ache , is a symptom associated with both non-serious and serious medical issues.
Common causes of pain in the abdomen include gastroenteritis and irritable bowel syndrome . [2] About 15% of people have a more serious underlying condition such as appendicitis , leaking or ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm , diverticulitis , or ectopic pregnancy . [2] In a third of cases the exact cause is unclear. [2]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ablutophobia


The English suffixes -phobia , -phobic , -phobe (from Greek φόβος phobos , "fear") occur in technical usage in psychiatry to construct words that describe irrational, abnormal , unwarranted, persistent, or disabling fear as a mental disorder (e.g. agoraphobia ), in chemistry to describe chemical aversions (e.g. hydrophobic ), in biology to describe organisms that dislike certain conditions (e.g. acidophobia ), and in medicine to describe hypersensitivity to a stimulus, usually sensory (e.g. photophobia ). In common usage, they also form words that describe dislike or hatred of a particular thing or subject (e.g. homophobia ). The suffix is antonymic to -phil- .
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abrasion
Abrasion may refer to:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acral_necrosis
Acral necrosis is a symptom common in bubonic plague .  The striking black discoloration of skin and tissue, primarily on the extremities ("acral"), is commonly thought to have given rise to the name " Black Death ," associated both with the disease and the pandemic which occurred in the 14th century. The term in fact came from the figural sense of "black", that is ghastly, lugubrious or dreadful. [1] [2]
Clotting and bleeding beneath the skin cause an area of haemorrhage, the presence of red blood cells lying outside of capillaries, into the skin and subcutaneous tissue.  In isolation, this is called an ecchymosis or bruise and may be the result of injury or illness.  However, acral necrosis occurs when blood supply is disrupted for prolonged periods, blackening and damaging the affected area and surrounding tissue.  With appropriate medical treatment, areas with acral necrosis may be successfully restored to function and lead a normal life.  Untreated cases can lead to death. [ citation needed ]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrophobia
Acrophobia is an extreme or irrational fear or phobia of heights, especially when one is not particularly high up. It belongs to a category of specific phobias , called space and motion discomfort, that share both similar causes and options for treatment.
Most people experience a degree of natural fear when exposed to heights, known as the fear of falling . On the other hand, those who have little fear of such exposure are said to have a head for heights . A head for heights is advantageous for those hiking or climbing in mountainous terrain and also in certain jobs such as steeplejacks or wind turbine mechanics.
People with acrophobia can experience a panic attack in high places and become too agitated to get themselves down safely. Approximately 2–5% of the general population has acrophobia, with twice as many women affected as men. [1] The term is from the Greek : ἄκρον , ákron , meaning "peak, summit, edge" and φόβος , phóbos , "fear".
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)
In medicine , describing a disease as acute denotes that it is of short duration and, as a corollary of that, of recent onset . The quantification of how much time constitutes "short" and "recent" varies by disease and by context, but the core denotation of "acute" is always qualitatively in contrast with " chronic ", which denotes long-lasting disease (for example, in acute leukaemia and chronic leukaemia ). In addition, "acute" also often connotes two other meanings: sudden onset and severity , such as in acute myocardial infarction (AMI), where suddenness and severity are both established aspects of the meaning. It thus often connotes that the condition is fulminant (as in the AMI example), but not always (as in acute rhinitis , which is usually synonymous with the common cold ). The one thing that acute MI and acute rhinitis have in common is that they are not chronic. They can happen again (as in recurrent pneumonia , that is, multiple acute pneumonia episodes), but they are not the same case ongoing for months or years (unlike chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , which is).
A noncount sense of "acute disease" refers to the acute phase, that is, a short course, of any disease entity. [1] [2] For example, in an article on ulcerative enteritis in poultry , the author says, "in acute disease there may be increased mortality without any obvious signs ", [3] referring to the acute form or phase of ulcerative enteritis.
Not all acute diseases or injuries are severe, and vice versa. For example, a mild stubbed toe is an acute injury. Similarly, many acute upper respiratory infections and acute gastroenteritis cases in adults are mild and usually resolve within a few days or weeks.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_myeloid_leukemia

Acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) is a cancer of the myeloid line of blood cells , characterized by the rapid growth of abnormal cells that build up in the bone marrow and blood and interfere with normal blood cell production . [1] Symptoms may include feeling tired, shortness of breath , easy bruising and bleeding, and increased risk of infection . [1] Occasionally, spread may occur to the brain, skin, or gums. [1] As an acute leukemia , AML progresses rapidly and is typically fatal within weeks or months if left untreated. [1] [6]
Risk factors include smoking , previous chemotherapy or radiation therapy , myelodysplastic syndrome , and exposure to the chemical benzene . [1] The underlying mechanism involves replacement of normal bone marrow with leukemia cells , which results in a drop in red blood cells , platelets , and normal white blood cells . [1] Diagnosis is generally based on bone marrow aspiration and specific blood tests . [3] AML has several subtypes for which treatments and outcomes may vary. [1]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_radiation_syndrome
Acute radiation syndrome ( ARS ), also known as radiation sickness or radiation poisoning , is a collection of health effects that are caused by being exposed to high amounts of ionizing radiation , in a short period of time. [1] The symptoms of ARS can start within the hour of exposure, and can last for several months. [1] [3] [5] Within the first few days the symptoms are usually nausea, vomiting and a loss of appetite. [1] In the following few hours or weeks will be a few symptoms, which later become additional symptoms, after which either recovery or death follow. [1]
ARS involves a total dose of greater than 0.7 Gy (70 rad ), that generally occurs from a source outside the body, delivered within a few minutes. [1] Sources of such radiation can occur accidentally or intentionally. [6] They may involve nuclear reactors , cyclotrons , and certain devices used in cancer therapy . [4] It is generally divided into three types: bone marrow, gastrointestinal, and neurovascular syndrome, with bone marrow syndrome occurring at 0.7 to 10 Gy, and neurovascular syndrome occurring at doses that exceed 50 Gy. [1] [3] The cells that are most affected are generally those that are rapidly dividing. [3] At high doses, this causes DNA damage that may be irreparable. [4] Diagnosis is based on a history of exposure and symptoms. [4] Repeated complete blood counts (CBCs) can indicate the severity of exposure. [1]
Treatment of ARS is generally supportive care . [3] This may include blood transfusions , antibiotics , colony-stimulating factors , or stem cell transplant . [3] Radioactive material remaining on the skin or in the stomach should be removed. [4] If radioiodine was inhaled or ingested, potassium iodide is recommended. [4] Complications like leukemia and other cancers among those who survive are managed as usual. [4] Short term outcomes depend on the dose exposure. [4]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_respiratory_distress_syndrome
Acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) is a type of respiratory failure characterized by rapid onset of widespread inflammation in the lungs . [1] Symptoms include shortness of breath (dyspnea), rapid breathing (tachypnea), and bluish skin coloration (cyanosis). [1] For those who survive, a decreased quality of life is common. [3]
Causes may include sepsis , pancreatitis , trauma , pneumonia , and aspiration . [1] The underlying mechanism involves diffuse injury to cells which form the barrier of the microscopic air sacs of the lungs , surfactant dysfunction, activation of the immune system , and dysfunction of the body's regulation of blood clotting . [4] In effect, ARDS impairs the lungs' ability to exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide . [1] Adult diagnosis is based on a PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio (ratio of partial pressure arterial oxygen and fraction of inspired oxygen) of less than 300 mm Hg despite a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of more than 5 cm H 2 O. [1] Cardiogenic pulmonary edema , as the cause, must be excluded. [3]
The primary treatment involves mechanical ventilation together with treatments directed at the underlying cause. [1] Ventilation strategies include using low volumes and low pressures. [1] If oxygenation remains insufficient, lung recruitment maneuvers and neuromuscular blockers may be used. [1] If these are insufficient, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) may be an option. [1] The syndrome is associated with a death rate between 35 and 50%. [1]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adderall

Adderall and Mydayis [4] are trade names [note 2] for a combination drug containing four salts of amphetamine . The mixture is composed of equal parts racemic amphetamine and dextroamphetamine , which produces a (3:1) ratio between dextroamphetamine and levoamphetamine , the two enantiomers of amphetamine. Both enantiomers are stimulants , but differ enough to give Adderall an effects profile distinct from those of racemic amphetamine or dextroamphetamine, [1] [2] which are marketed as Evekeo and Dexedrine/Zenzedi, respectively. [1] [6] [7] Adderall is used in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy . It is also used as an athletic performance enhancer , cognitive enhancer , appetite suppressant , and recreationally as an aphrodisiac and euphoriant . It is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant of the phenethylamine class . [1]
Adderall is generally well tolerated and effective in treating the symptoms of ADHD and narcolepsy. At therapeutic doses, Adderall causes emotional and cognitive effects such as euphoria , change in sex drive , increased wakefulness , and improved cognitive control . At these doses, it induces physical effects such as a faster reaction time, fatigue resistance, and increased muscle strength. In contrast, much larger doses of Adderall can impair cognitive control, cause rapid muscle breakdown , provoke panic attacks , or induce a psychosis (e.g., paranoia , delusions , hallucinations ). The side effects of Adderall vary widely among individuals, but most commonly include insomnia , dry mouth , loss of appetite , and weight loss . The risk of developing an addiction or dependence is insignificant when Adderall is used as prescribed at fairly low daily doses, such as those used for treating ADHD; however, the routine use of Adderall in larger daily doses poses a significant risk of addiction or dependence due to the pronounced reinforcing effects that are present at high doses. Recreational doses of amphetamine are generally much larger than prescribed therapeutic doses , and carry a far greater risk of serious adverse effects. [sources 1]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenoidectomy
Adenoidectomy is the surgical removal of the adenoid for reasons which include impaired breathing through the nose, chronic infections, or recurrent earaches. The effectiveness of removing the adenoids in children to improve recurrent nasal symptoms and/or nasal obstruction has not been well studied. [1] The surgery is less commonly performed in adults in whom the adenoid is much smaller and less active than it is in children. It is most often done on an outpatient basis under general anesthesia . Post-operative pain is generally minimal and reduced by icy or cold foods. The procedure is often combined with tonsillectomy (this combination is usually called an "adenotonsillectomy" or "T&A"), for which the recovery time is an estimated 10-14 days, sometimes longer, mostly dependent on age.
Adenoidectomy is not often performed under one year of age as adenoid function is part of the body's immune system but its contribution to this decreases progressively beyond this age.
The indications for adenoidectomy are still controversial. [2] [3] [4] Widest agreement surrounds the removal of the adenoid for obstructive sleep apnea, usually combined with tonsillectomy. [5] Even then, it has been observed that a significant percentage of the study population (18%) did not respond.
There is also support for adenoidectomy in recurrent otitis media in children previously treated with tympanostomy tubes . [6] Finally, the effectiveness of adenoidectomy in children with recurrent upper respiratory tract infections, common cold, otitis media and moderate nasal obstruction has been questioned with the outcome, [1] in some studies, being no better than watchful waiting. [7] [8]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjustment_disorder
Adjustment disorder is a maladaptive response to a psychosocial stressor that occurs when an individual has significant difficulty adjusting to or coping with a stressful psychosocial event. The maladaptive response usually involves otherwise normal emotional and behavioral reactions that manifest more intensely than usual (taking into account contextual and cultural factors), causing marked distress, preoccupation with the stressor and its consequences, and functional impairment. [2] [3] [4] [5]
Diagnosis of AjD is quite common; there is an estimated incidence of 5–21% among psychiatric consultation services for adults. Adult women are diagnosed twice as often as are adult men. Among children and adolescents, girls and boys are equally likely to receive this diagnosis. [6] : 681 AjD was introduced into the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders in 1980. Prior to that, it was called "transient situational disturbance." [7]
Some emotional signs of adjustment disorder are: sadness, hopelessness, lack of enjoyment, crying spells, nervousness, anxiety, desperation, feeling overwhelmed and thoughts of suicide, performing poorly in school/work etc.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenal_tumor
An adrenal tumor or adrenal mass [2] is any benign or malignant neoplasms of the adrenal gland , several of which are notable for their tendency to overproduce endocrine hormones . Adrenal cancer is the presence of malignant adrenal tumors, and includes neuroblastoma , adrenocortical carcinoma and some adrenal pheochromocytomas . Most adrenal pheochromocytomas and all adrenocortical adenomas are benign tumors, which do not metastasize or invade nearby tissues, but may cause significant health problems by unbalancing hormones.
Metastasis to one or both adrenal glands is the most common form of malignant adrenal lesion, and the second most common adrenal tumor after benign adenomas. [4] Primary tumors in such cases are most commonly from lung cancer (39%), breast cancer (35%), malignant melanoma , gastrointestinal tract cancer , pancreas cancer , and renal cancer . [4]
The adrenal cortex is composed of three distinct layers of endocrine cells which produce critical steroid hormones . These include the glucocorticoids which are critical for regulation of blood sugar and the immune system , as well as response to physiological stress , the mineralcorticoid aldosterone , which regulates blood pressure and kidney function, and certain sex hormones . Both benign and malignant tumors of the adrenal cortex may produce steroid hormones, with important clinical consequences. [ citation needed ]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenoleukodystrophy
Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is a disease linked to the X chromosome . It is a result of fatty acid buildup caused by a defect in the very long chain of fatty acids transporter in peroxisomes, which then causes damage to the myelin sheath of the nerves , resulting in seizures and hyperactivity. Other symptoms include problems with speaking, listening, and understanding verbal instructions.
In more detail, it is a disorder of peroxisomal fatty acid beta oxidation which results in the accumulation of very long chain fatty acids in tissues throughout the body.  The most severely affected tissues are the myelin in the central nervous system , the adrenal cortex , and the Leydig cells in the testes.  Clinically, ALD is a heterogeneous disorder, presenting with several distinct phenotypes , and no clear pattern of genotype -phenotype correlation.  As an X-linked disorder, ALD presents most commonly in males, however approximately 50% of heterozygote females show some symptoms later in life.  Approximately two-thirds of ALD patients will present with the childhood cerebral form of the disease, which is the most severe form.  It is characterized by normal development in early childhood, followed by rapid degeneration to a vegetative state .  The other forms of ALD vary in terms of onset and clinical severity, ranging from adrenal insufficiency to progressive paraparesis in early adulthood (this form of the disease is typically known as adrenomyeloneuropathy).
ALD is caused by mutations in ABCD1 , a gene located on the X chromosome that codes for ALD, a peroxisomal membrane transporter protein.  The exact mechanism of the pathogenesis of the various forms of ALD is not known.  Biochemically, individuals with ALD show very high levels of unbranched, saturated, very long chain fatty acids, particularly cerotic acid (26:0).  The level of cerotic acid in plasma does not correlate with clinical presentation.  Treatment options for ALD are limited.  Dietary treatment is with Lorenzo's oil .  For the childhood cerebral form, stem cell transplant and gene therapy are options if the disease is detected early in the clinical course.  Adrenal insufficiency in ALD patients can be successfully treated.  ALD is the most common peroxisomal inborn error of metabolism, with an incidence estimated between 1:18,000 and 1:50,000.  It does not have a significantly higher incidence in any specific ethnic groups.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airborne_transmission

An airborne transmission is disease transmission through small particulates that can be transmitted through the air over time and distance. [2] Diseases capable of airborne transmission include many of considerable importance both in human and veterinary medicine . The relevant pathogens may be viruses , bacteria , or fungi , and they may be spread through breathing, talking, coughing, sneezing, raising of dust, spraying of liquids, flushing toilets , or any activities which generate aerosol particles or droplets . Human airborne diseases do not include conditions caused by air pollution such as volatile organic compounds (VOCs), gases and any airborne particles.
Airborne transmission traditionally has been considered distinct from transmission by droplets , based on misunderstandings of the physical behaviour of particles of various sizes. [3] Respiratory droplets were thought to be large enough to fall to the ground rapidly after being produced; [4] however, if particles of any size can be inhaled, they are essentially airborne particles. [3]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_hand_syndrome
Alien hand syndrome ( AHS ) or Dr. Strangelove syndrome [1] is a category of conditions in which a person experiences their limbs acting seemingly on their own, without conscious control over the actions. [2] There are a variety of clinical conditions that fall under this category, which most commonly affects the left hand. [3] There are many similar terms for the various forms of the condition, but they are often used inappropriately. [4] The afflicted person may sometimes reach for objects and manipulate them without wanting to do so, even to the point of having to use the controllable hand to restrain the alien hand. [5] While under normal circumstances, thought, as intent, and action can be assumed to be deeply mutually entangled, the occurrence of alien hand syndrome can be usefully conceptualized as a phenomenon reflecting a functional "disentanglement" between thought and action.
Alien hand syndrome is best documented in cases where a person has had the two hemispheres of their brain surgically separated , [ citation needed ] a procedure sometimes used to relieve the symptoms of extreme cases of epilepsy and epileptic psychosis , e.g., temporal lobe epilepsy . It also occurs in some cases after brain surgery , stroke , infection , tumor , aneurysm , migraine and specific degenerative brain conditions such as Alzheimer's disease , Corticobasal degeneration [6] and Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease . [ citation needed ] Other areas of the brain that are associated with alien hand syndrome are the frontal , occipital , and parietal lobes . [7] [8] [ unreliable medical source? ]
"Alien behavior" can be distinguished from reflexive behavior in that the former is flexibly purposive while the latter is obligatory. Sometimes the sufferer will not be aware of what the alien hand is doing until it is brought to his or her attention, or until the hand does something that draws their attention to its behavior. There is a clear distinction between the behaviors of the two hands in which the affected hand is viewed as "wayward" and sometimes "disobedient" and generally out of the realm of their own voluntary control, while the unaffected hand is under normal volitional control. At times, particularly in patients who have sustained damage to the corpus callosum that connects the two cerebral hemispheres (see also split-brain ), the hands appear to be acting in opposition to each other. [9]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alprazolam

Alprazolam , sold under the brand name Xanax , among others, is a short-acting tranquilizer of the triazolobenzodiazepine (TBZD) class, which are benzodiazepines (BZDs) fused with a triazole ring. [6] It is most commonly used in short-term management of anxiety disorders , specifically panic disorder or generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). [7] Other uses include the treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea , together with other treatments. [5] GAD improvement occurs generally within a week. [8] [9] Alprazolam is generally taken by mouth . [5]
Common side effects include sleepiness, depression, headaches, feeling tired, dry mouth , and memory problems . [5] Some of the sedation and tiredness may improve within a few days. [10] Due to concerns about misuse, some do not recommend alprazolam as an initial treatment for panic disorder. [11] Withdrawal or rebound symptoms may occur if use is suddenly decreased; [5] gradually decreasing the dose over weeks or months may be required. [8] Other rare risks include suicide , possibly due to loss of inhibition . [12] Alprazolam, like other benzodiazepines, acts through the GABA A receptor . [5]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine

Alternative medicine is any practice that aims to achieve the healing effects of medicine , but which lacks biological plausibility and is untested , untestable or proven ineffective. Complementary medicine ( CM ), complementary and alternative medicine ( CAM ), integrated medicine or integrative medicine ( IM ), and holistic medicine are among many rebrandings of the same phenomenon. Alternative therapies share in common that they reside outside medical science , and rely on pseudoscience . Traditional practices become "alternative" when used outside their original settings without proper scientific explanation and evidence. Frequently used derogatory terms for the alternative are new-age or pseudo , with little distinction from quackery .
Some alternative practices are based on theories that contradict the science of how the human body works; others resort to the supernatural or superstitious to explain their effect. In others, the practice is plausibly effective but has too many side effects . Alternative medicine is distinct from scientific medicine, which employs the scientific method to test plausible therapies by way of responsible and ethical clinical trials , producing evidence of either effect or of no effect. Research into alternative therapies often fails to follow proper research protocols (such as placebo - controlled trials, blind experiments and calculation of prior probability ), providing invalid results.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aminoglycoside
Aminoglycoside is a medicinal and bacteriologic category of traditional Gram-negative antibacterial medications that inhibit protein synthesis and contain as a portion of the molecule an amino-modified glycoside ( sugar ). [1] [2] The term can also refer more generally to any organic molecule that contains amino sugar substructures. Aminoglycoside antibiotics display bactericidal activity against Gram-negative aerobes and some anaerobic bacilli where resistance has not yet arisen but generally not against Gram-positive and anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria. [3]
Streptomycin is the first-in-class aminoglycoside antibiotic . It is derived from Streptomyces griseus and is the earliest modern agent used against tuberculosis . Streptomycin lacks the common 2-deoxystreptamine moiety (image right, below) present in most other members of this class. Other examples of aminoglycosides include the deoxystreptamine-containing agents kanamycin , tobramycin , gentamicin , and neomycin (see below).
Aminoglycosides that are derived from bacteria of the Streptomyces genus are named with the suffix -mycin , whereas those that are derived from Micromonospora [4] are named with the suffix -micin . [5] However, this nomenclature system is not specific for aminoglycosides, and so appearance of this set of suffixes does not imply common mechanism of action. (For instance, vancomycin , a glycopeptide antibiotic , [6] and erythromycin , [7] a macrolide antibiotic produced by Saccharopolyspora erythraea , along with its synthetic derivatives clarithromycin and azithromycin , all share the suffixes but have notably different mechanisms of action.)
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amniocentesis
Amniocentesis (also referred to as an amniotic fluid test or, informally, an " amnio ") is a medical procedure [note 1] used primarily in prenatal diagnosis of chromosomal abnormalities and fetal infections [1] as well as for sex determination . In this procedure, a small amount of amniotic fluid , which contains fetal tissues, is sampled from the amniotic sac surrounding a developing fetus . The fetal DNA is then examined for genetic abnormalities.
The most common reason to have an amniocentesis performed is to determine whether a fetus has certain genetic disorders or a chromosomal abnormality, such as Down syndrome . Amniocentesis (or another procedure, called chorionic villus sampling (CVS)) can diagnose these problems in the womb. [2] These prenatal examinations can prove helpful to expectant guardians, as they allow for evaluating the fetal health status and the feasibility of treatment. [3]
An amniocentesis is performed when a woman is between 15 and 20 weeks gestation. [4] Women who choose to have this test are primarily those at increased risk for genetic and chromosomal problems, in part because the test is invasive and carries a small risk of miscarriage . [4] This process can be used for prenatal sex discernment and hence this procedure has legal restrictions in some countries.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphetamine

Amphetamine [note 2] (contracted from a lpha - m ethyl ph en et hyl amine ) is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant that is used in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), narcolepsy , and obesity . Amphetamine was discovered in 1887 and exists as two enantiomers : [note 3] levoamphetamine and dextroamphetamine . Amphetamine properly refers to a specific chemical, the racemic free base , which is equal parts of the two enantiomers, levoamphetamine and dextroamphetamine, in their pure amine forms. The term is frequently used informally to refer to any combination of the enantiomers, or to either of them alone. Historically, it has been used to treat nasal congestion and depression. Amphetamine is also used as an athletic performance enhancer and cognitive enhancer , and recreationally as an aphrodisiac and euphoriant . It is a prescription drug in many countries, and unauthorized possession and distribution of amphetamine are often tightly controlled due to the significant health risks associated with recreational use . [sources 1]
The first amphetamine pharmaceutical was Benzedrine , a brand which was used to treat a variety of conditions. Currently, pharmaceutical amphetamine is prescribed as racemic amphetamine, Adderall , [note 4] dextroamphetamine , or the inactive prodrug lisdexamfetamine . Amphetamine increases monoamine and excitatory neurotransmission in the brain, with its most pronounced effects targeting the norepinephrine and dopamine neurotransmitter systems . [sources 2]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amputation
Physical medicine and rehabilitation
Amputation is the removal of a limb by trauma , medical illness , or surgery . As a surgical measure, it is used to control pain or a disease process in the affected limb, such as malignancy or gangrene . In some cases, it is carried out on individuals as a preventive surgery for such problems. A special case is that of congenital amputation , a congenital disorder , where fetal limbs have been cut off by constrictive bands. In some countries, such as the United States [1] [2] and Iran, [3] amputation was proposed, was formerly used, or is currently used to punish people who committed crimes. [4] [5] [6] Amputation has also been used as a tactic in war and acts of terrorism; it may also occur as a war injury. In some cultures and religions, minor amputations or mutilations are considered a ritual accomplishment. [7] [8] [9]
When done by a person, the person executing the amputation is an amputator. [10] The amputated person is called an amputee. [11]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloidosis
Amyloidosis is a group of diseases in which abnormal proteins , known as amyloid fibrils , build up in tissue. [4] There are several types with varying symptoms; signs and symptoms may include diarrhea , weight loss, feeling tired, enlargement of the tongue, bleeding, numbness, feeling faint with standing , swelling of the legs, or enlargement of the spleen. [2]
There are about 30 different types of amyloidosis, each due to a specific protein misfolding . [5] Some are genetic while others are acquired. [3] They are grouped into localized forms , and systemic ones. [2] The four most common types of systemic amyloidosis are light chain (AL) , inflammation ( AA ), dialysis-related (Aβ 2 M), and hereditary and old age ( ATTR and familial amyloid polyneuropathy [6] ). [2]
Diagnosis may be suspected when protein is found in the urine , organ enlargement is present, or problems are found with multiple peripheral nerves and it is unclear why. [2] Diagnosis is confirmed by tissue biopsy . [2] Due to the variable presentation, a diagnosis can often take some time to reach. [3]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analgesic
An analgesic or painkiller is any member of the group of drugs used to achieve analgesia, relief from pain . They are distinct from anesthetics , which temporarily affect, and in some instances completely eliminate, sensation .
Analgesic choice is also determined by the type of pain: For neuropathic pain , traditional analgesics are less effective, and there is often benefit from classes of drugs that are not normally considered analgesics, such as tricyclic antidepressants and anticonvulsants . [1]
Analgesics are typically classified based on their mechanism of action. [2]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_psychology
Analytical psychology ( German : Analytische Psychologie , sometimes translated as analytic psychology and referred to as Jungian analysis ) is a term coined by Carl Jung , a Swiss psychiatrist , to describe research into his new "empirical science" of the psyche. It was designed to distinguish it from Freud's psychoanalytic theories as their seven-year collaboration on psychoanalysis was drawing to an end between 1912 and 1913. [1] [2] [3] The evolution of his science is contained in his monumental opus , the Collected Works , written over sixty years of his lifetime. [4]
The history of analytical psychology is intimately linked with the biography of Jung. At the start, it was known as the "Zurich school", whose chief figures were Eugen Bleuler , Franz Riklin , Alphonse Maeder and Jung, all centred in the Burghölzli hospital in Zurich. It was initially a theory concerning psychological complexes until Jung, upon breaking with Sigmund Freud , turned it into a generalised method of investigating archetypes and the unconscious , as well as into a specialised psychotherapy .
Analytical psychology, or "complex psychology", from the German : Komplexe Psychologie , is the foundation of many developments in the study and practice of Psychology as of other disciplines. The followers of Jung are many, and some of them are members of national societies in diverse countries around the world. They collaborate professionally on an international level through the International Association of Analytical Psychologists (IAAP) and the International Association for Jungian Studies (IAJS). Jung's propositions have given rise to a rich and multidisciplinary literature in numerous languages.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaphrodisiac
An anaphrodisiac (also antaphrodisiac or antiaphrodisiac ) is a substance that quells or blunts the libido . It is the opposite of an aphrodisiac , something that enhances sexual appetite. The word anaphrodisiac comes from the Greek privative prefix ἀν- , denoting negation, and aphrodisiac , from the Greek goddess of love, Aphrodite . Some people use anaphrodisiacs in order to curb a very high libido or due to hypersexuality . [1] However anaphrodisiacs are also used by those with an average libido, at times due to having incessant schedules. [2]
Some common anaphrodisiacs are ethanol (alcohol) and tobacco , but this is typically an unintended consequence and not often the main reason for use. While alcohol is used socially because it initially reduces mental inhibitions, studies have shown that over time alcohol physically decreases arousal and makes achieving climax more difficult. [3] For this reason alcohol is considered an anaphrodisiac.
Opioids , the class of pain-reducing substances which include morphine , heroin , and hydrocodone , are anaphrodisiacs.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesiologist
Anesthesiology , anaesthesiology , anaesthesia or anaesthetics (see Terminology ) is the medical specialty concerned with the total perioperative care of patients before, during and after surgery . [1] It encompasses anesthesia , intensive care medicine , critical emergency medicine , and pain medicine . [2] A physician specialized in this field of medicine is called an anesthesiologist , anaesthesiologist or anaesthetist , depending on the country (see Terminology ). [3] [4] [5] [6]
The core element of the specialty is the study and use of anesthesia and anesthetics to safely support a patient's vital functions through the perioperative period. Since the 19th century, anesthesiology has developed from an experimental area with non-specialist practitioners using novel, untested drugs and techniques into what is now a highly refined, safe and effective field of medicine. In some countries  anesthesiologists comprise the largest single cohort of doctors in hospitals, [7] [8] and their role can extend far beyond the traditional role of anesthesia care in the operating room , including fields such as providing pre-hospital emergency medicine , running intensive care units , transporting critically ill patients between facilities, and prehabilitation programs to optimize patients for surgery. [7]
The word "anaesthesia" appears to have first been used in the modern medical sense of the word by Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. in 1846, and it gained currency when adopted by James Young Simpson the following year. "Anesthesiology" was proposed in 1889 by Henry William Blanc, and was re-coined by Mathias Joseph Seifert in 1902. [9] The name derives from  the Ancient Greek roots ἀν- an- , "not", αἴσθησις aísthēsis , “sensation”, and -λογία -logia , "study".
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthetic

An anesthetic ( American English ) or anaesthetic ( British English ; see spelling differences ) is a drug used to induce anesthesia ⁠— ⁠in other words, to result in a temporary loss of sensation or awareness . They may be divided into two broad classes: general anesthetics , which result in a reversible loss of consciousness , and local anesthetics , which cause a reversible loss of sensation for a limited region of the body without necessarily affecting consciousness.
A wide variety of drugs are used in modern anesthetic practice.  Many are rarely used outside anesthesiology , but others are used commonly in various fields of healthcare. Combinations of anesthetics are sometimes used for their synergistic and additive therapeutic effects. Adverse effects, however, may also be increased. [1] Anesthetics are distinct from analgesics , which block only sensation of painful stimuli.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography
Angiography or arteriography is a medical imaging technique used to visualize the inside, or lumen , of blood vessels and organs of the body, with particular interest in the arteries , veins , and the heart chambers . This is traditionally done by injecting a radio-opaque contrast agent into the blood vessel and imaging using X-ray based techniques such as fluoroscopy .
The word itself comes from the Greek words ἀγγεῖον angeion 'vessel' and γράφειν graphein 'to write, record'. The film or image of the blood vessels is called an angiograph , or more commonly an angiogram . Though the word can describe both an arteriogram and a venogram , in everyday usage the terms angiogram and arteriogram are often used synonymously, whereas the term venogram is used more precisely. [1]
The term angiography has been applied to radionuclide angiography and newer vascular imaging techniques such as CO 2 angiography , CT angiography and MR angiography . [2] The term isotope angiography has also been used, although this more correctly is referred to as isotope perfusion scanning .
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_euthanasia

Animal euthanasia ( euthanasia from Greek : εὐθανασία ; "good death") is the act of killing an animal or allowing it to die by withholding extreme medical measures. Reasons for euthanasia include incurable (and especially painful) conditions or diseases, [1] lack of resources to continue supporting the animal, or laboratory test procedures. Euthanasia methods are designed to cause minimal pain and distress. Euthanasia is distinct from animal slaughter and pest control although in some cases the procedure is the same.
In domesticated animals, this process is commonly referred to by euphemisms such as "put down" [2] or "put to sleep". [3]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankylosing_spondylitis

Ankylosing spondylitis ( AS ) is a type of arthritis in which there is a long-term inflammation of the joints of the spine . [2] Typically the joints where the spine joins the pelvis are also affected. [2] Occasionally other joints such as the shoulders or hips are involved. [2] Eye and bowel problems may also occur. [2] Back pain is a characteristic symptom of AS, and it often comes and goes. [2] Stiffness of the affected joints generally worsens over time. [2] [4]
Although the cause of ankylosing spondylitis is unknown, it is believed to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors. [2] More than 85% of those affected in the UK have a specific human leukocyte antigen known as the HLA-B27 antigen. [5] The underlying mechanism is believed to be autoimmune or autoinflammatory . [6] Diagnosis is typically based on the symptoms with support from medical imaging and blood tests . [2] AS is a type of seronegative spondyloarthropathy , meaning that tests show no presence of rheumatoid factor (RF) antibodies . [2] It is also within a broader category known as axial spondyloarthritis . [7]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antacid
An antacid is a substance which neutralizes stomach acidity and is used to relieve heartburn , indigestion or an upset stomach. [1] Some antacids have been used in the treatment of constipation and diarrhea . [2] Currently marketed antacids contain salts of aluminum , calcium , magnesium , or sodium . [2] Some preparations contain a combination of two salts, such as magnesium carbonate and aluminum hydroxide . [3]
Antacids are available over the counter and are taken by mouth to quickly relieve occasional heartburn , the major symptom of gastroesophageal reflux disease and indigestion . Treatment with antacids alone is symptomatic and only justified for minor symptoms. [4] Alternative uses for antacids include constipation, diarrhea,  hyperphosphatemia, and urinary alkalization. [5] Some antacids are also used as an adjunct to pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy in the treatment of pancreatic insufficiency . [6]
Non-particulate antacids ( sodium citrate , magnesium trisilicate ) increase gastric pH with little or no effect on gastric volume, and therefore may see some limited use in pre-operative procedures. Sodium citrate should be given within 1 hour of surgery to be the most effective. [7]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticoagulant
Anticoagulants , commonly known as blood thinners , are chemical substances that prevent or reduce coagulation of blood , prolonging the clotting time . [1] Some of them occur naturally in blood-eating animals such as leeches and mosquitoes , where they help keep the bite area unclotted long enough for the animal to obtain some blood. [2] [3] As a class of medications , anticoagulants are used in therapy for thrombotic disorders . [4] Oral anticoagulants (OACs) are taken by many people in pill or tablet form, and various intravenous anticoagulant dosage forms are used in hospitals. [5] [6] Some anticoagulants are used in medical equipment, such as sample tubes, blood transfusion bags, heart-lung machines , and dialysis equipment. [7] [8] One of the first anticoagulants, warfarin, was initially approved as a rodenticide . [9]
Anticoagulants are closely related to antiplatelet drugs and thrombolytic drugs by manipulating the various pathways of blood coagulation. [10] Specifically, antiplatelet drugs inhibit platelet aggregation (clumping together), whereas anticoagulants inhibit specific pathways of the coagulation cascade, which happens after the initial platelet aggregation and ultimately leads to formation of fibrin and stable aggregated platelet products. [11] [12]
Common anticoagulants include warfarin and heparin . [13]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimony_pill
An antimony pill is a pill made from metallic antimony . It was a popular remedy in the nineteenth century, and it was used to purge and revitalise the bowels. In use, it is swallowed and allowed to pass through the body, after which it is customarily recovered for reuse, giving rise to the name everlasting pill . The antimonial cup yielded the same effect. [1]
According to the Medico-Pharmaceutical Critic and Guide (1907), edited by William J. Robinson :
We have     referred in the past to the economy which used to be practiced by our fore-fathers. Thus, for instance, it was customary to use leeches over and over again and there are instances of infection with syphilis by leeches that had been previously used on luetic patients. But we believe that the everlasting cathartic pill beats everything in the line of economy. This pill was a little bullet composed of metallic antimony which had or was believed to have the property of purging as often as it was swallowed. It is not inconceivable that it might have had such property, for it is possible that a minute amount was dissolved by the gastro-intestinal juices and this amount, plus the suggestion, was sufficient to produce cathartic action. Then again the everlasting pill probably aided peristalsis by its mechanical weight and motion. The bullet was passed out, recovered from the feces and used over and over again. This, as Dr. J. A. Paris says, was economy in right earnest, for a single pill would serve a whole family during their lives and might be transmitted as an heirloom to posterity. [2]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiplatelet_drug
An antiplatelet drug (antiaggregant), also known as a platelet agglutination inhibitor or platelet aggregation inhibitor , is a member of a class of pharmaceuticals that decrease platelet aggregation [1] and inhibit thrombus formation. They are effective in the arterial circulation where anticoagulants have little effect. [ citation needed ]
They are widely used in primary and secondary prevention of thrombotic cerebrovascular or cardiovascular disease.
Antiplatelet therapy with one or more of these drugs decreases the ability of blood clots to form by interfering with the platelet activation process in primary hemostasis . [2] Antiplatelet drugs can reversibly or irreversibly inhibit the process involved in platelet activation resulting in decreased tendency of platelets to adhere to one another and to damaged blood vessels' endothelium. [2]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipsychotic

Antipsychotics , also known as neuroleptics , [1] are a class of psychotropic medication primarily used to manage psychosis (including delusions , hallucinations , paranoia or disordered thought ), principally in schizophrenia but also in a range of other psychotic disorders. [2] They are also the mainstay together with mood stabilizers in the treatment of bipolar disorder . [3]
Recent research has shown that use of any antipsychotic results in smaller brain tissue volumes and that this brain shrinkage is dose dependent and time dependent. [4] A review of the research has also reinforced this effect. [5]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiseptic
Antiseptics (from Greek ἀντί anti , "against" [1] and σηπτικός sēptikos , "putrefactive" [2] ) are antimicrobial substances that are applied to living tissue / skin to reduce the possibility of infection , sepsis , or putrefaction . Antiseptics are generally distinguished from antibiotics by the latter's ability to safely destroy bacteria within the body, and from disinfectants , which destroy microorganisms found on non-living objects. [3]
Some antiseptics are true germicides , capable of destroying microbes ( bacteriocidal ), while others are bacteriostatic and only prevent or inhibit their growth. [4]
Antibacterials include antiseptics that have the proven ability to act against bacteria. Microbicides which destroy virus particles are called viricides or antivirals . Antifungals , also known as antimycotics , are pharmaceutical fungicides used to treat and prevent mycosis (fungal infection).
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antivenom
Antivenom , also known as antivenin , venom antiserum , and antivenom immunoglobulin , is a specific treatment for envenomation . It is composed of antibodies and used to treat certain venomous bites and stings. [1] Antivenoms are recommended only if there is significant toxicity or a high risk of toxicity. [1] The specific antivenom needed depends on the species involved. [1] It is given by injection. [1]
Side effects may be severe. [1] They include serum sickness , shortness of breath , and allergic reactions including anaphylaxis . [1] Antivenom is traditionally made by collecting venom from the relevant animal and injecting small amounts of it into a domestic animal. [2] The antibodies that form are then collected from the domestic animal's blood and purified. [2] Versions are available for spider bites , snake bites , fish stings , and scorpion stings . [3] Due to the high cost of producing antibody-based antivenoms and their short shelf lives when not refrigerated, alternative methods of production of antivenoms are being actively explored. [4] One such different method of production involves production from bacteria. [5] Another approach is to develop targeted drugs (which, unlike antibodies, are usually synthetic and easier to manufacture at scale). [6]
Antivenom was first developed in the late 19th century and came into common use in the 1950s. [2] [7] It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines . [8]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiolytic

An anxiolytic ( / ˌ æ ŋ k s i ə ˈ l ɪ t ɪ k , ˌ æ ŋ k s i oʊ -/ ; also antipanic or antianxiety agent ) [1] is a medication, or other intervention, that reduces anxiety . This effect is in contrast to anxiogenic agents, which increase anxiety.  Anxiolytic medications have been used for the treatment of anxiety disorder and its related psychological and physical symptoms. Light therapy and other interventions have also been found to have an anxiolytic effect. [2]
Beta-receptor blockers such as propranolol and oxprenolol are sometimes used to combat the somatic symptoms of anxiety such as tachycardia and palpitations . [3]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appendectomy
An appendectomy , also termed appendicectomy , is a surgical operation in which the vermiform appendix (a portion of the intestine) is removed. Appendectomy is normally performed as an urgent or emergency procedure to treat complicated acute appendicitis . [1]
Appendectomy may be performed laparoscopically (as minimally invasive surgery ) or as an open operation. [2] Over the 2010s, surgical practice has increasingly moved towards routinely offering laparoscopic appendicectomy; for example in the United Kingdom over 95% of adult appendicectomies are planned as laparoscopic procedures. [3] Laparoscopy is often used if the diagnosis is in doubt, or in order to leave a less visible surgical scar. Recovery may be slightly faster after laparoscopic surgery, although the laparoscopic procedure itself is more expensive and resource-intensive than open surgery and generally takes longer. Advanced pelvic sepsis occasionally requires a lower midline laparotomy .
Both uncomplicated (non-perforated) and complicated (perforated) appendicitis should undergo prompt surgical intervention. [1] The difference in treatment occurs post-operatively with respect to the length of time the antibiotics are administered. For uncomplicated appendicitis, antibiotics should be continued up to 24 hours post-operatively. For complicated appendicitis, antibiotics should be continued for anywhere between 3 and 7 days. [1] An interval appendectomy is generally performed 6-8 weeks after conservative management with antibiotics for special cases, such as perforated appendicitis. [4] Delay of appendectomy 24 hours after admission for symptoms of appendicitis has not shown to increase risk of perforation or other complications. [5]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon_plasma_coagulation
Argon plasma coagulation ( APC ) is a medical endoscopic procedure used to control bleeding from certain lesions in the gastrointestinal tract . It is administered during esophagogastroduodenoscopy or colonoscopy .
APC involves the use of a jet of ionized argon gas ( plasma ) directed through a probe passed through the endoscope . The probe is placed at some distance from the bleeding lesion, and argon gas is emitted, then ionized by a high-voltage discharge (approx 6 kV ). [1] High-frequency electric current is then conducted through the jet of gas, resulting in coagulation of the bleeding lesion. As no physical contact is made with the lesion, the procedure is safe if the bowel has been cleaned of colonic gases, [2] [3] and can be used to treat bleeding in parts of the gastrointestinal tract with thin walls, such as the cecum . The depth of coagulation is usually only a few millimetres.
APC is used to treat the following conditions:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aripiprazole
Aripiprazole , sold under the brand name Abilify among others, is an atypical antipsychotic . [5] It is primarily used in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder . [5] Other uses include as an add-on treatment in major depressive disorder , tic disorders and irritability associated with autism . [5] It is taken by mouth or injection into a muscle . [5] A Cochrane review found evidence of effectiveness in treating schizophrenia. [6]
In adults, side effects with greater than 10% incidence include weight gain, headache, akathisia , insomnia, and gastro-intestinal effects like nausea and constipation, and lightheadedness. [2] [3] [4] [7] [8] Side effects in children are similar, and include sleepiness, increased appetite, and stuffy nose. [7] A strong desire to gamble, binge eat, shop, and engage in sexual activity may also occur. [9] [10]
Common side effects include vomiting, constipation, sleepiness, dizziness, weight gain and movement disorders . [5] Serious side effects may include neuroleptic malignant syndrome , tardive dyskinesia and anaphylaxis . [5] It is not recommended for older people with dementia -related psychosis due to an increased risk of death. [5] In pregnancy , there is evidence of possible harm to the baby. [5] [11] It is not recommended in women who are breastfeeding . [5] It has not been very well studied in people less than 18 years old. [5] The exact mode of action is not entirely clear but may involve effects on dopamine and serotonin . [5]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arteriovenous_malformation
Arteriovenous malformation is an abnormal connection between arteries and veins , bypassing the capillary system . This vascular anomaly is widely known because of its occurrence in the central nervous system (usually cerebral AVM ), but can appear in any location. Although many AVMs are asymptomatic, they can cause intense pain or bleeding or lead to other serious medical problems.
AVMs are usually congenital and belong to the RASopathies .
The genetic transmission patterns of AVMs are incomplete, but there are known genetic mutations (for instance in the epithelial line, tumor suppressor PTEN gene) which can lead to an increased occurrence throughout the body.
Symptoms of AVM vary according to the location of the malformation. Roughly 88% [1] of people with an AVM are asymptomatic; often the malformation is discovered as part of an autopsy or during treatment of an unrelated disorder (called in medicine an "incidental finding"); in rare cases, its expansion or a micro-bleed from an AVM in the brain can cause epilepsy, neurological deficit, or pain.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_pacemaker
A cardiac pacemaker (or artificial pacemaker , so as not to be confused with the natural pacemaker of the heart ), is a medical device that generates electrical impulses delivered by electrodes to cause the heart muscle chambers (the upper, or atria and/or the lower, or ventricles ) to contract and therefore pump blood; by doing so this device replaces and/or regulates the function of the electrical conduction system of the heart .
The primary purpose of a pacemaker is to maintain an adequate heart rate , either because the heart's natural pacemaker is not fast enough, or because there is a block in the heart's electrical conduction system. Modern pacemakers are externally programmable and allow a cardiologist, particularly a cardiac electrophysiologist to select the optimal pacing modes for individual patients. 
Modern devices are demand pacemakers , in which the stimulation of the heart is based on the dynamic demand of the circulatory system . [1] [2]
A specific type of pacemaker called a defibrillator combines pacemaker and defibrillator functions in a single implantable device, which should be called a defibrillator, for clarity. Others, called biventricular pacemakers have multiple electrodes stimulating differing positions within the lower heart chambers to improve synchronization of the ventricles , the lower chambers of the heart.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asepsis
Asepsis is the state of being free from disease-causing micro-organisms (such as pathogenic bacteria , viruses , pathogenic fungi , and parasites ). [1] There are two categories of asepsis: medical and surgical. [1] The modern day notion of asepsis is derived from the older antiseptic techniques, a shift initiated by different individuals in the 19th century who introduced practices such as the sterilizing of surgical tools and the wearing of surgical gloves during operations. [2] The goal of asepsis is to eliminate infection, not to achieve sterility. [1] Ideally, a surgical field is sterile , meaning it is free of all biological contaminants (e.g. fungi, bacteria, viruses), not just those that can cause disease, putrefaction , or fermentation . [1] Even in an aseptic state, a condition of sterile inflammation may develop. The term often refers to those practices used to promote or induce asepsis in an operative field of surgery or medicine to prevent infection . [3]
The modern concept of asepsis evolved in the 19th century through multiple individuals. Ignaz Semmelweis showed that hand washing prior to delivery reduced puerperal fever . Despite this, many hospitals continued to practice surgery in unsanitary conditions, wit
h some surgeons taking pride in their bloodstained operating gowns. [4] It was not until after reading of the findings by Louis Pasteur that Joseph Lister introduced the use of carbolic acid as an antiseptic, and in doing so, reduced surgical infection rates. [5] Lawson Tait shifted the movement then from antisepsis to asepsis, instilling practices such as a strict no-talking policy within his operating room and drastically limiting the number of people to come in contact with a patient's wound. [6] Ernst von Bergmann also introduced the autoclave , a device used for the practice of the sterilization of surgical instruments. [7]
But, everything from operating room uniforms to gloves was pioneered by William Halsted . Preceding modern-day scrubs attire, Halsted implemented a no street clothes policy in his operating room, opting to wear a completely white, sterile uniform consisting of a duck suit , tennis shoes , and skullcap . [2] This helped to prevent the introduction of infections into open wounds. [2] Additionally, Halsted would sterilize the operation site with alcohol, iodine and other disinfectants and use drapes to cover all areas except for the site. [2] In his department at Johns Hopkins Hospital , he enforced an extreme hand washing ritual consisting of soaking in harmfully strong chemicals like permanganate and mercury bichloride solution as well as scrubbing with stiff brushes. [2] The damage to a surgical nurse's hands compelled him to create the earliest form of the surgical gloves with the Goodyear Rubber Company . [2] These gloves became a part of the aseptic surgery standard when Dr. Joseph Colt Bloodgood and several others began wearing them for that particular purpose. [8]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assisted_suicide

Assisted suicide , also known as assisted dying or medical aid in dying , is suicide undertaken with the aid of another person. [1] The term usually refers to physician-assisted suicide ( PAS ), which is suicide that is assisted by a physician or other healthcare provider. Once it is determined that the person's situation qualifies under the physician-assisted suicide laws for that place, the physician's assistance is usually limited to writing a prescription for a lethal dose of drugs.
In many jurisdictions, helping a person die by suicide is a crime . [2] People who support legalizing physician-assisted suicide want the people who assist in a voluntary death to be exempt from criminal prosecution for manslaughter or similar crimes. Physician-assisted suicide is legal in some countries, under certain circumstances, including Canada , Belgium , the Netherlands , Luxembourg , Spain , Switzerland , Germany , parts of the United States ( California , Colorado , Hawaii , Maine , Montana , New Jersey , Oregon , Vermont , Washington and Washington, D.C. ) and Australia ( Tasmania , Victoria and Western Australia ). The Constitutional Court of Austria and Colombia legalized assisted suicide, but their governments have not legislated or regulated the practice yet. New Zealand legalized assisted suicide in a referendum in 2020 , but it will come into force on 6 November 2021. The parliament of Portugal passed the legalization of assisted suicide, but is now under consideration of the Constitutional Court.

Augusta Victoria Compound is a church-hospital complex on the northern side [1] of Mount of Olives in East Jerusalem and one of six hospitals in the East Jerusalem Hospitals Network . The compound was built in 1907–1914 by the Empress Augusta Victoria Foundation as a center for the German Protestant community in Ottoman Palestine , in addition to the slightly older Church of the Redeemer from Jerusalem's Old City . Apart from the hospital, today the complex also includes the German Protestant [2] Church of the Ascension with a c. 50 metre high belltower , a meeting centre for pilgrims and tourists, an interreligious kindergarten and a café, as well as the Jerusalem branch of the German Protestant Institute of Archaeology. [3]
Throughout much of its history, the compound was used first and foremost as a hospital, either by the military (during the First and Second World Wars and during Jordanian rule), or for Palestinian refugees and general public (from 1950 until today), and at times also as a government or military headquarters (1915–1927).
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autotransplantation
Autotransplantation is the transplantation of organs , tissues , or even particular proteins from one part of the body to another in the same person ( auto- meaning "self" in Greek [1] ).
The autologous tissue (also called autogenous , autogeneic , or autogenic tissue) transplanted by such a procedure is called an autograft or autotransplant . [2]
It is contrasted with allotransplantation (from other individual of the same species), Syngeneic transplantation (grafts transplanted between two genetically identical individuals of the same species) and xenotransplantation (from other species).
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayurveda

Ayurveda ( / ˌ ɑː j ʊər ˈ v eɪ d ə , - ˈ v iː -/ ) [1] is an alternative medicine system with historical roots in the Indian subcontinent. [2] The theory and practice of Ayurveda is pseudoscientific . [3] [4] [5] The Indian Medical Association (IMA) characterises the practice of medicine by Ayurvedic practitioners as quackery . [6] Ayurveda is heavily practiced in India and Nepal, where around 80% of the population report using it. [7] [8] [9] [10]
Ayurveda therapies have varied and evolved over more than two millennia. [2] Therapies include medicines, special diets, meditation, yoga, massage, laxatives, enemas, and medical oils. [11] [12] Medicines are typically based on complex herbal compounds, minerals, and metal substances (perhaps under the influence of early Indian alchemy or rasa shastra ). Ancient Ayurveda texts also taught surgical techniques, including rhinoplasty , kidney stone extractions , sutures, and the extraction of foreign objects. [13] [14]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azathioprine
Azathioprine ( AZA ), sold under the brand name Imuran , among others, is an immunosuppressive medication . [2] It is used in rheumatoid arthritis , granulomatosis with polyangiitis , Crohn's disease , ulcerative colitis , and systemic lupus erythematosus , and in kidney transplants to prevent rejection . [2] [3] [4] [5] It is taken by mouth or injected into a vein . [2]
Common side effects include bone-marrow suppression and vomiting . [2] Bone-marrow suppression is especially common in people with a genetic deficiency of the enzyme thiopurine S-methyltransferase . [2] Other serious risk factors include an increased risk of certain cancers . [2] Use during pregnancy may result in harm to the baby. [2] Azathioprine is in the purine analogue and antimetabolite family of medications. [2] [6] It works via 6-thioguanine to disrupt the making of RNA and DNA by cells. [2] [6]
Azathioprine was first made in 1957. [6] It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines . [7] In 2017, it was the 335th-most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 800,000 prescriptions. [8]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacillus_Calmette-Gu%C3%A9rin

Bacillus Calmette–Guérin ( BCG ) vaccine is a vaccine primarily used against tuberculosis (TB). [4] It is named after its inventors Albert Calmette and Camille Guérin . [5] [6] In countries where TB or leprosy is common, one dose is recommended in healthy babies as soon after birth as possible. [4] In areas where TB is not common, only children at high risk are typically immunized, while suspected cases of TB are individually tested for and treated. [4] Adults who do not have TB and have not been previously immunized but are frequently exposed may be immunized as well. [4] BCG also has some effectiveness against Buruli ulcer infection and other nontuberculous mycobacteria infections. [4] Additionally it is sometimes used as part of the treatment of bladder cancer . [7] [8]
Rates of protection against TB infection vary widely and protection lasts up to twenty years. [4] Among children it prevents about 20% from getting infected and among those who do get infected it protects half from developing disease. [9] The vaccine is given by injection into the skin. [4] There is no evidence that additional doses are beneficial. [4]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandage
A bandage is a piece of material used either to support a medical device such as a dressing or splint , or on its own to provide support to or to restrict the movement of a part of the body. When used with a dressing, the dressing is applied directly on a wound, and a bandage used to hold the dressing in place.  Other bandages are used without dressings, such as elastic bandages that are used to reduce swelling or provide support to a sprained ankle.  Tight bandages can be used to slow blood flow to an extremity, such as when a leg or arm is bleeding heavily.
Bandages are available in a wide range of types, from generic cloth strips to specialized shaped bandages designed for a specific limb or part of the body.  Bandages can often be improvised as the situation demands, using clothing, blankets or other material.  In American English , the word bandage is often used to indicate a small gauze dressing attached to an adhesive bandage .
The most common type of bandage is the gauze bandage, a woven strip of material with a Telfa absorbent barrier to prevent adhering to wounds. A gauze bandage can come in any number of widths and lengths and can be used for almost any bandage application, including holding a dressing in place.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbiturate
A barbiturate [a] is a drug that acts as a central nervous system depressant . Barbiturates are effective as anxiolytics , hypnotics , and anticonvulsants , but have physical and psychological addiction potential as well as overdose potential among other possible adverse effects. They have largely been replaced by benzodiazepines and nonbenzodiazepines ("Z-drugs") in routine medical practice, particularly in the treatment of anxiety and insomnia, due to the significantly lower risk of addiction and overdose and the lack of an antidote for barbiturate overdose. Despite this, barbiturates are still in use for various purposes: in general anesthesia , epilepsy , treatment of acute migraines or cluster headaches , acute tension headaches , euthanasia , capital punishment , and assisted suicide . [2]
The name barbiturate originates from the fact that they are all chemical derivatives of barbituric acid . [3]
Barbiturates such as phenobarbital were long used as anxiolytics and hypnotics . Intermediate-acting barbiturates reduce time to fall asleep, increase total sleep time, and reduce REM sleep time. Today they have been largely replaced by benzodiazepines for these purposes because the latter are less toxic in drug overdose . [4] [5] [6] However, barbiturates are still used as anticonvulsants (e.g., phenobarbital and primidone ) and general anesthetics (e.g., sodium thiopental ).
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bat-borne_virus

Bat virome refers to the group of viruses associated with bats . Bats host a diverse array of viruses, including all seven types described by the Baltimore classification system : (I) double-stranded DNA viruses ; (II) single-stranded DNA viruses ; (III) double-stranded RNA viruses ; (IV) positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses ; (V) negative-sense single-stranded RNA viruses ; (VI) positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses that replicate through a DNA intermediate ; and (VII) double-stranded DNA viruses that replicate through a single-stranded RNA intermediate . The greatest share of bat-associated viruses identified as of 2020 are of type IV, in the family Coronaviridae .
Bats harbor several viruses that are zoonotic , or capable of infecting humans, and some bat-borne viruses are considered important emerging viruses . [1] [2] These zoonotic viruses include the rabies virus , SARS-CoV , MERS-CoV , Marburg virus , Nipah virus , and Hendra virus . While research clearly indicates that SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats, [3] it is unknown how it was transmitted to humans, or if an intermediate host was involved. It has been speculated that bats may have a role in the ecology of the Ebola virus, though this is unconfirmed. While transmission of rabies from bats to humans usually occurs via biting, most other zoonotic bat viruses are transmitted by direct contact with infected bat fluids like urine, guano , or saliva, or through contact with an infected, non-bat intermediate host . There is no firm evidence that butchering or consuming bat meat can lead to viral transmission, though this has been speculated.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benadryl

Benadryl is a  brand of various antihistamine medications used to stop allergies , whose content varies in different countries, but which includes some or no combination of diphenhydramine , acrivastine , and cetirizine .
It is sold by Johnson & Johnson . Benadryl is used to relieve allergy symptoms such as sneezing, itching, runny nose, rash , and hives . [1] Some forms of Benadryl are to be taken orally, while some creams and gels are to be applied to the skin. [2] Common side effects of the drug include drowsiness , dizziness , dry mouth and throat, confusion, and blurred vision . [2]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benign
Benignity (from Latin benignus "kind, good", itself deriving from bonus "good" and genus "origin") is any condition that is harmless in the long run. The opposite of benignity is malignity (or malignancy in medical discourse ).
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_blocker

Beta blockers ( beta-blockers , β-blockers , etc.) are a class of medications that are predominantly used to manage abnormal heart rhythms , and to protect the heart from a second heart attack ( myocardial infarction ) after a first heart attack ( secondary prevention ). [1] They are also widely used to treat high blood pressure ( hypertension ), although they are no longer the first choice for initial treatment of most patients. [2]
Beta blockers are competitive antagonists that block the receptor sites for the endogenous catecholamines epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine (noradrenaline) on adrenergic beta receptors , of the sympathetic nervous system , which mediates the fight-or-flight response . [3] [4] Some block activation of all types of β-adrenergic receptors and others are selective for one of the three known types of beta receptors, designated β 1 , β 2 and β 3 receptors. [5] β 1 -adrenergic receptors are located mainly in the heart and in the kidneys. [4] β 2 -adrenergic receptors are located mainly in the lungs, gastrointestinal tract, liver, uterus, vascular smooth muscle, and skeletal muscle. [4] β 3 -adrenergic receptors are located in fat cells. [6]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bevacizumab

Bevacizumab , sold under the brand name Avastin , is a medication used to treat a number of types of cancers and a specific eye disease . [6] [7] For cancer, it is given by slow injection into a vein ( intravenous ) and used for colon cancer , lung cancer , glioblastoma , and renal-cell carcinoma . In many of these diseases it is used as a first-line therapy [6] [7] For age-related macular degeneration it is given by injection into the eye ( intravitreal ). [6]
Common side effects when used for cancer include nose bleeds , headache, high blood pressure, and rash. [6] Other severe side effects include gastrointestinal perforation , bleeding, allergic reactions , blood clots , and an increased risk of infection. [6] When used for eye disease side effects can include vision loss and retinal detachment . [6] Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody that functions as an angiogenesis inhibitor . [6] It works by slowing the growth of new blood vessels by inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), in other words anti–VEGF therapy . [6]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bibliomania
Bibliomania can be a symptom of obsessive–compulsive disorder which involves the collecting or even hoarding of books to the point where social relations or health are damaged.
Bibliomania is not to be confused with bibliophilia , which is the (psychologically healthy) love of books, and as such is not considered a clinical psychological disorder.
One of several unusual behaviors associated with books, bibliomania is characterized by the collecting of books which have no use to the collector nor any great intrinsic value to a genuine book collector. The purchase of multiple copies of the same book and edition and the accumulation of books beyond possible capacity of use or enjoyment are frequent symptoms of bibliomania. [1] Bibliomania is not a psychological disorder recognized by the American Psychiatric Association in its DSM-IV. [2]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binge_eating
Binge eating is a pattern of disordered eating which consists of episodes of uncontrollable eating. It is a common symptom of eating disorders such as binge eating disorder and bulimia nervosa . During such binges, a person rapidly consumes an excessive quantity of food.  A diagnosis of binge eating is associated with feelings of loss of control. [1] Binge eating disorder is also linked with overweight and obesity. [2]
The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, or rather the DSM, is a manual that is produced by the American Psychiatric Association (APA). In the DSM-5, which was released in 2013 by the APA, they included a disorder diagnosis criteria for Binge Eating Disorder (BED). It is as follows: [3]
Typical warning signs of  binge eating disorder include the disappearance of large amount of foods in relatively short periods of time. A person who may be experiencing binge eating disorder may appear to be uncomfortable when eating around others or in public. [4] A person may develop new and extreme eating patterns that they have never done before. These might include diets that cut out certain food groups completely such as a no dairy or no carb diet. They might also steal or hoard food in unusual places. [4] A person may be experiencing fluctuations in their weight. In addition they may have feelings of disgust, depression, or guilt about over eating. [4] Another possible warning sign of binge eating is that a person may be obsessed with their body image or weight. [5]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy
A biopsy is a medical test commonly performed by a surgeon , interventional radiologist , or an interventional cardiologist . The process involves extraction of sample cells or tissues for examination to determine the presence or extent of a disease. The tissue is generally examined under a microscope by a pathologist ; it may also be analyzed chemically. When an entire lump or suspicious area is removed, the procedure is called an excisional biopsy .  An incisional biopsy or core biopsy samples a portion of the abnormal tissue without attempting to remove the entire lesion or tumor. When a sample of tissue or fluid is removed with a needle in such a way that cells are removed without preserving the histological architecture of the tissue cells, the procedure is called a needle aspiration biopsy . Biopsies are most commonly performed for insight into possible cancerous or inflammatory conditions.
The Arab physician Abulcasis (1013–1107) developed one of the earliest diagnostic biopsies. He used a needle  to puncture a goiter and then characterized the material. [1] [ verification needed ]
The term biopsy reflects the Greek words βίος bios , "life," and ὄψις opsis , "a sight." [2]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_defect
A birth defect , also known as a congenital disorder , is a condition present at birth regardless of its cause. [3] Birth defects may result in disabilities that may be physical , intellectual , or developmental . [3] The disabilities can range from mild to severe. [7] Birth defects are divided into two main types: structural disorders in which problems are seen with the shape of a body part and functional disorders in which problems exist with how a body part works. [4] Functional disorders include metabolic and degenerative disorders . [4] Some birth defects include both structural and functional disorders. [4]
Birth defects may result from genetic or chromosomal disorders , exposure to certain medications or chemicals, or certain infections during pregnancy . [5] Risk factors include folate deficiency , drinking alcohol or smoking during pregnancy, poorly controlled diabetes , and a mother over the age of 35 years old. [6] [7] Many are believed to involve multiple factors. [7] Birth defects may be visible at birth or diagnosed by screening tests . [10] A number of defects can be detected before birth by different prenatal tests . [10]
Treatment varies depending on the defect in question. [8] This may include therapy , medication, surgery, or assistive technology . [8] Birth defects affected about 96 million people as of 2015. [11] In the United States, they occur in about 3% of newborns. [2] They resulted in about 628,000 deaths in 2015, down from 751,000 in 1990. [12] [9] The types with the greatest numbers of deaths are congenital heart disease (303,000), followed by neural tube defects (65,000). [9]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_donation
A blood donation occurs when a person voluntarily has blood drawn and used for transfusions and/or made into biopharmaceutical medications by a process called fractionation (separation of whole blood components). Donation may be of whole blood, or of specific components directly ( apheresis ). Blood banks often participate in the collection process as well as the procedures that follow it.
Today in the developed world , most blood donors are unpaid volunteers who donate blood for a community supply. In some countries, established supplies are limited and donors usually give blood when family or friends need a transfusion (directed donation).  Many donors donate for several reasons, such as a form of charity, general awareness regarding the demand for blood, increased confidence in oneself, helping a personal friend or relative, and social pressure.  Despite the many reasons that people donate, not enough potential donors actively donate.  However, this is reversed during disasters when blood donations increase, often creating an excess supply that will have to be later discarded.  However, in countries that allow paid donation some people are paid, and in some cases there are incentives other than money such as paid time off from work. People can also have blood drawn for their own future use ( autologous donation ). Donating is relatively safe, but some donors have bruising where the needle is inserted or may feel faint.
Potential donors are evaluated for anything that might make their blood unsafe to use. The screening includes testing for diseases that can be transmitted by a blood transfusion, including HIV and viral hepatitis . The donor must also answer questions about medical history and take a short physical examination to make sure the donation is not hazardous to his or her health. How often a donor can donate varies from days to months based on what component they donate and the laws of the country where the donation takes place. For example, in the United States, donors must wait 56 days (eight weeks) between whole-blood donations but only seven days between platelet apheresis donations [1] and twice per seven-day period in plasmapheresis .
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_doping
Blood doping is the practice of boosting the number of red blood cells in the bloodstream in order to enhance athletic performance. Because such blood cells carry oxygen from the lungs to the muscles , a higher concentration in the blood can improve an athlete's aerobic capacity (VO 2 max) and endurance . [1] Blood doping can be achieved by making the body produce more red blood cells itself using drugs, giving blood transfusions either from another person or back to the same individual, or by using blood substitutes.
Many methods of blood doping are illegal, particularly in professional sports where it is considered to give an artificial advantage to the competitor. Anti-doping agencies use tests to try to identify individuals who have been blood doping using a number of methods, typically by analysing blood samples from the competitors.
Blood doping is defined as the use of illicit products (e.g. erythropoietin (EPO), darbepoetin-alfa, hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) stabilizers) and methods (e.g. increase aerobic capacity by maximizing the uptake of O 2 ) in order to enhance the O 2 transport of the body to the muscles. [2]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_draw
In medicine, venipuncture or venepuncture is the process of obtaining intravenous access for the purpose of venous blood sampling (also called phlebotomy ) or intravenous therapy . In healthcare, this procedure is performed by medical laboratory scientists , medical practitioners , some EMTs , paramedics , phlebotomists , dialysis technicians, and other nursing staff. [1] In veterinary medicine , the procedure is performed by veterinarians and veterinary technicians .
It is essential to follow a standard procedure for the collection of blood specimens to get accurate laboratory results. Any error in collecting the blood or filling the test tubes may lead to erroneous laboratory results. [2]
Venipuncture is one of the most routinely performed invasive procedures and is carried out for any of five reasons:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_film
A blood film —or peripheral blood smear —is a thin layer of blood smeared on a glass microscope slide and then stained in such a way as to allow the various blood cells to be examined microscopically. Blood films are examined in the investigation of hematological (blood) disorders and  are routinely employed to look for blood parasites , such as those of malaria and filariasis .
Blood films are made by placing a drop of blood on one end of a slide, and using a spreader slide to disperse the blood over the slide's length. The aim is to get a region, called a monolayer, where the cells are spaced far enough apart to be counted and differentiated. The monolayer is found in the "feathered edge" created by the spreader slide as it draws the blood forward.
The slide is left to air dry, after which the blood is fixed to the slide by immersing it briefly in methanol . The fixative is essential for good staining and presentation of cellular detail. After fixation, the slide is stained to distinguish the cells from each other.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test
A blood test is a laboratory analysis performed on a blood sample that is usually extracted from a vein in the arm using a hypodermic needle , or via fingerprick . Multiple tests for specific blood components, such as a glucose test or a cholesterol test , are often grouped together into one test panel called a blood panel or blood work . Blood tests are often used in health care to determine physiological and biochemical states, such as disease , mineral content, pharmaceutical drug effectiveness, and organ function. Typical clinical blood panels include a basic metabolic panel or a complete blood count . Blood tests are also used in drug tests to detect drug abuse.
A venipuncture is useful as it is a minimally invasive way to obtain cells and extracellular fluid ( plasma ) from the body for analysis. Blood flows throughout the body, acting as a medium that provides oxygen and nutrients to tissues and carries waste products back to the excretory systems for disposal. Consequently, the state of the bloodstream affects or is affected by, many medical conditions. For these reasons, blood tests are the most commonly performed medical tests . [1]
If only a few drops of blood are needed, a fingerstick is performed instead of a venipuncture . [2]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_transfusion
Blood transfusion is the process of transferring blood products into one's circulation intravenously . [1] Transfusions are used for various medical conditions to replace lost components of the blood. Early transfusions used whole blood , but modern medical practice commonly uses only components of the blood, such as red blood cells , white blood cells , plasma , clotting factors , and platelets .
Red blood cells (RBC) contain hemoglobin , and supply the cells of the body with oxygen . White blood cells are not commonly used during transfusion, but are part of the immune system, and fight infections. Plasma is the "yellowish" liquid part of blood, which acts as a buffer, and contains proteins and important substances needed for the body's overall health. Platelets are involved in blood clotting, preventing the body from bleeding. Before these components were known, doctors believed that blood was homogenous. Because of this, many patients died because incompatible blood was transferred to them.
Historically, red blood cell transfusion was considered when the hemoglobin level fell below 10 g/dL or hematocrit fell below 30%. [2] [3] Because each unit of blood given carries risks, a trigger level lower than that, at 7 to 8 g/dL, is now usually used, as it has been shown to have better patient outcomes. [4] [5] The administration of a single unit of blood is the standard for hospitalized people who are not bleeding, with this treatment followed with re-assessment and consideration of symptoms and hemoglobin concentration. [4] Patients with poor oxygen saturation may need more blood. [4] The advisory caution to use blood transfusion only with more severe anemia is in part due to evidence that outcomes are worsened if larger amounts are given. [6] One may consider transfusion for people with symptoms of cardiovascular disease such as chest pain or shortness of breath. [3] In cases where patients have low levels of hemoglobin due to iron deficiency, but are cardiovascularly stable, parenteral iron is a preferred option based on both efficacy and safety. [7] Other blood products are given where appropriate, e.g., to treat clotting deficiencies.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloodletting
Bloodletting (or blood-letting ) is the withdrawal of blood from a patient to prevent or cure illness and disease.  Bloodletting, whether by a physician or by leeches , was based on an ancient system of medicine in which blood and other bodily fluids were regarded as " humours " that had to remain in proper balance to maintain health. It is claimed to have been the most common medical practice performed by surgeons from antiquity until the late 19th century, a span of over 2,000 years. [1] In Europe, the practice continued to be relatively common until the end of the 18th century. [2] The practice has now been abandoned by modern-style medicine for all except a few very specific medical conditions . [3] It is conceivable that historically, in the absence of other treatments for hypertension , bloodletting sometimes had a beneficial effect in temporarily reducing blood pressure by reducing blood volume. [4] However, since hypertension is very often asymptomatic and thus not diagnosable without modern methods, this effect was unintentional.  In the overwhelming majority of cases, the historical use of bloodletting was harmful to patients. [5]
Today, the term phlebotomy refers to the drawing of blood for laboratory analysis or blood transfusion . [6] Therapeutic phlebotomy refers to the drawing of a unit of blood in specific cases like hemochromatosis , polycythemia vera , porphyria cutanea tarda , etc., to reduce the number of red blood cells. [7] [8] The traditional medical practice of bloodletting is today considered to be a pseudoscience . [9]
Passages from the Ebers  Papyrus may indicate that bloodletting by scarification  was an accepted practice in Ancient Egypt . [10] [11] [12] Egyptian burials have been reported to contain bloodletting instruments. [13] According to some accounts, the Egyptians based the idea on their observations of the hippopotamus , [14] confusing its red secretions with blood and believing that it scratched itself to relieve distress. [15] [16]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow_failure
Bone marrow failure occurs in individuals who produce an insufficient amount of red blood cells , white blood cells or platelets . Red blood cells transport oxygen to be distributed throughout the body’s tissue. White blood cells fight off infections that enter the body. Bone marrow also contains platelets , which trigger clotting , and thus help stop the blood flow when a wound occurs. [1]
Bone marrow failure is associated with three types of diseases, Fanconi anemia (FA), dyskeratosis congenita , and aplastic anemia . Fanconi anemia is an inherited blood disorder due to abnormal breakages in DNA genes. It is linked to hyperpigmentation, which is the darkening of an area of skin or nails caused by increased melanin. According to Histopathology, “However, in about 30% of FA patients no physical abnormalities are found”. [2] Dyskeratosis congenita often affects multiple parts of the body. Individuals with this disorder usually show changes in skin pigmentations, unusual fingernail growth, and mucosa leukoplakia; the inner part of the mouth is encased with white patches that may never resolve. [2] Aplastic anemia happens when bone marrow doesn’t produce enough new blood cells throughout the body. Aplastic anemia is an acquired autoimmune disease, which occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys healthy body tissue. [3]
Bone marrow failure in both children and adults can be either inherited or acquired. Inherited bone marrow failure is often the cause in young children, while older children and adults may acquire the disease later in life. [4] A maturation defect in genes is a common cause of inherited bone marrow failure. [5] The most common cause of acquired bone marrow failure is aplastic anemia. [5] Working with chemicals such as benzene could be a factor in causing the illness. Other factors include radiation or chemotherapy treatments, and immune system problems.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_metastasis
Bone metastases , or osseous metastatic disease, is a category of cancer metastases that results from primary tumor invasion to bone .  Bone-originating primary tumors such as osteosarcoma , chondrosarcoma , and Ewing's sarcoma are rare. [1] Unlike hematological malignancies that originate in the blood and form non-solid tumors, bone metastases generally arise from epithelial tumors and form a solid mass inside the bone.  Bone metastases cause severe pain, characterized by a dull, constant ache with periodic spikes of incident pain . [2]
Under normal conditions, bone undergoes a continuous remodeling through osteoclast -mediated bone resorption and osteoblast -mediated bone deposition. [3] These processes are normally tightly regulated within bone to maintain bone structure and calcium homeostasis in the body.  Disregulation of these processes by tumor cells leads to either osteoblastic or osteolytic lesions, reflective of the underlying mechanism of development. [3] Typically, osteolytic metastases are more aggressive than osteoblastic metastases, which have a slower course.  Regardless of the phenotype, though, bone metastases show osteoclast proliferation and hypertrophy . [4]
Primary tumors
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowel_obstruction

Bowel obstruction , also known as intestinal obstruction , is a mechanical or functional obstruction of the intestines which prevents the normal movement of the products of digestion . [2] [5] Either the small bowel or large bowel may be affected. [1] Signs and symptoms include abdominal pain , vomiting , bloating and not passing gas . [1] Mechanical obstruction is the cause of about 5 to 15% of cases of severe abdominal pain of sudden onset requiring admission to hospital. [1] [2]
Causes of bowel obstruction include adhesions , hernias , volvulus , endometriosis , inflammatory bowel disease , appendicitis , tumors , diverticulitis , ischemic bowel , tuberculosis and intussusception . [1] [2] Small bowel obstructions are most often due to adhesions and hernias while large bowel obstructions are most often due to tumors and volvulus. [1] [2] The diagnosis may be made on plain X-rays ; however, CT scan is more accurate. [1] Ultrasound or MRI may help in the diagnosis of children or pregnant women. [1]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_augmentation
Breast augmentation and augmentation mammoplasty ( colloquially : " boob job ") is a cosmetic surgery technique using breast-implants and fat-graft mammoplasty techniques to increase the size, change the shape, and alter the texture of the breasts of a woman. Augmentation mammoplasty is applied to correct congenital defects of the breasts and the chest wall. [ citation needed ] As an elective cosmetic surgery, primary augmentation changes the aesthetics – of size, shape, and texture – of healthy breasts. [ citation needed ]
The surgical implantation approach creates a spherical augmentation of the breast hemisphere, using a breast implant filled with either saline solution or silicone gel ; the fat-graft transfer approach augments the size and corrects contour defects of the breast hemisphere with grafts of the adipocyte fat tissue , drawn from the person's body.
In a breast reconstruction procedure, a tissue expander (a temporary breast implant device) is sometimes put in place and inflated with saline to prepare (shape and enlarge) the recipient site (implant pocket) to receive and accommodate the breast implant prosthesis.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_reduction
Reduction mammoplasty (also breast reduction and reduction mammaplasty ) is the plastic surgery procedure for reducing the size of large breasts. In a breast reduction surgery for re-establishing a functional bust that is proportionate to the woman's body, the critical corrective consideration is the tissue viability of the nipple–areola complex (NAC), to ensure the functional sensitivity and lactational capability of the breasts. The indications for breast reduction surgery are three-fold – physical, aesthetic , and psychological – the restoration of the bust, of the woman's self-image , and of her mental health . [1]
In corrective practice, the surgical techniques and praxis for reduction mammoplasty also are applied to mastopexy (breast lift). [2] [3]
The woman afflicted with macromastia presents heavy, enlarged breasts that sag and cause her chronic pains to the head, neck, shoulders, and back; an oversized bust also causes her secondary health problems, such as poor blood circulation , impaired breathing (inability to fill the lungs with air); chafing of the skin of the chest and the lower breast (inframammary intertrigo); brassière-strap indentations to the shoulders; and the improper fit of clothes.

The Bristol stool scale is a diagnostic medical tool designed to classify the form of human faeces into seven categories. It is used in both clinical and experimental fields. [3] [4] [5]
It was developed at the Bristol Royal Infirmary as a clinical assessment tool in 1997, and is widely used as a research tool to evaluate the effectiveness of treatments for various diseases of the bowel, as well as a clinical communication aid; [6] [7] including being part of the diagnostic triad for irritable bowel syndrome .

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Medical_Journal

The BMJ is a weekly peer-reviewed medical trade journal , published by the trade union the British Medical Association (BMA). The BMJ has editorial freedom from the BMA. [1] It is one of the world's oldest general medical journals. Originally called the British Medical Journal , the title was officially shortened to BMJ in 1988, and then changed to The BMJ in 2014. [2] The journal is published by BMJ Publishing Group Ltd , a subsidiary of the British Medical Association (BMA). The editor-in-chief of The BMJ is Fiona Godlee , who was appointed in February 2005. [3]
The journal began publishing on 3 October 1840 as the Provincial Medical and Surgical Journal and quickly attracted the attention of physicians around the world through its publication of high-impact original research articles and unique case reports. [4] The BMJ' s first editors were P. Hennis Green , lecturer on the diseases of children at the Hunterian School of Medicine , who also was its founder and Robert Streeten of Worcester , a member of the Provincial Medical and Surgical Association council.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bupropion

Bupropion , sold under the brand names Wellbutrin and Zyban among others, is an atypical antidepressant primarily used to treat major depressive disorder and to support smoking cessation . [6] [7] Bupropion is an effective antidepressant on its own, but it is also popular as an add-on medication in the cases of incomplete response to the first-line selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant. [7] [8] Bupropion has several features that distinguish it from other antidepressants: it does not usually cause sexual dysfunction; [7] it is not associated with weight gain [7] and sleepiness , [9] and it is more effective than SSRIs at improving symptoms of hypersomnia and fatigue. [10]
Common adverse effects of bupropion with the greatest difference from placebo are dry mouth, nausea, constipation, insomnia, anxiety, tremor, and excessive sweating. [11] Raised blood pressure is notable. [12] Rare but serious side effects include seizure , [11] liver toxicity , [13] psychosis , [14] and risk of overdose. [15] Bupropion use during pregnancy may be associated with increased odds of congenital heart defects . [16]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cancer_Council_Australia

Cancer Council Australia is a national, NFP organisation which aims to promote cancer -control policies and to reduce the illness caused by cancer in Australia . It advises various groups, including the government, on cancer-related issues, acts as an advocate for cancer patients and their friends, and is a major funding contributor towards health research , prevention and education .
Cancer Council Australia formed in 1961 as the Australian Cancer Society. [1] It was renamed Cancer Council Australia in 1997 and appointed Alan Coates its inaugural CEO. [1]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_of_unknown_primary_origin
Cancer of unknown primary origin ( CUP ) is a cancer that is determined to be at the metastatic stage at the time of diagnosis, but a primary tumor cannot be identified. A diagnosis of CUP requires a clinical picture consistent with metastatic disease and one or more biopsy results inconsistent with a tumor cancer
CUP is found in about 3 to 5% of all people diagnosed with invasive cancer, [1] and carries a poor prognosis in most (80 to 85%) of those circumstances.  The other 15 to 20% of patients, however, have a relatively long survival with appropriate treatment. [1]
Most cancers typically present as a single primary tumor .  Over the course of time—particularly if the primary tumor is left untreated—smaller "satellite" tumors will appear at other places in the body, a phenomenon known as metastasis .  Less commonly, a metastatic tumor is found first; but in most such cases, the primary tumor can then be located via examination and testing.  Rarely (3-5% of the time), the primary tumor cannot be found because it is too small, or because it has regressed due to immune system activity or other factors. In such situations a diagnosis of cancer of unknown primary origin (CUP) is made.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_drug_testing
Cannabis drug testing describes various drug test methodologies for the use of cannabis in medicine, sport, and law. Cannabis use is highly detectable and can be detected by urinalysis , hair analysis , as well as saliva tests for days or weeks.
Unlike alcohol, for which impairment can be reasonably measured using a breathalyser (and confirmed with a blood alcohol content measurement), valid detection for cannabis is time-consuming, and tests cannot determine an approximate degree of impairment. The lack of suitable tests and agreed-upon intoxication levels is an issue in the legality of cannabis , especially regarding intoxicated driving .
The concentrations obtained from such analyses can often be helpful in distinguishing active use from passive exposure, elapsed time since use, and extent or duration of use. Although between 2000-2020 there had been a recall for 80% of at home drug testing kits. Because of this many companies took action and the industries identified the contents of these products which led them to take efforts of identifying the problem by finding a solution involving the chemical immunoassay. This was the main cause of why drug tests were so unreliable for the time being.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiology
Cardiology (from Greek καρδίᾱ kardiā , "heart" and -λογία -logia , "study") is a branch of medicine that deals with the disorders of the heart as well as some parts of the circulatory system . The field includes medical diagnosis and treatment of congenital heart defects , coronary artery disease , heart failure , valvular heart disease and electrophysiology . Physicians who specialize in this field of medicine are called cardiologists , a specialty of internal medicine . Pediatric cardiologists are pediatricians who specialize in cardiology. Physicians who specialize in cardiac surgery are called cardiothoracic surgeons or cardiac surgeons , a specialty of general surgery .
All cardiologists study the disorders of the heart, but the study of adult and child heart disorders are through different training pathways. Therefore, an adult cardiologist (often simply called "cardiologist") is inadequately trained to take care of children, and pediatric cardiologists are not trained to take care of adult heart disease. The surgical aspects are not included in cardiology and are in the domain of cardiothoracic surgery . For example, coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG), cardiopulmonary bypass and valve replacement are surgical procedures performed by surgeons, not cardiologists. However, the insertion of stents and pacemakers is performed by cardiologists. [ citation needed ]
Cardiology is a specialty of internal medicine . To be a cardiologist in the United States , a three-year residency in internal medicine is followed by a three-year fellowship in cardiology. It is possible to specialize further in a sub-specialty. Recognized sub-specialties in the United States by the ACGME are cardiac electrophysiology , echocardiography , interventional cardiology , and nuclear cardiology . Recognized subspecialties in the United States by the American Osteopathic Association Bureau of Osteopathic Specialists (AOABOS) include clinical cardiac electrophysiology and interventional cardiology . [1] [2] While in India, a person needs to undergo three years of residency in General Medicine or Pediatrics after M.B.B.S and then three years of residency in Cardiology to be a D.M/ Diplomate of National Board (DNB) in Cardiology.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease

Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) is a class of diseases that involve the heart or blood vessels . [2] CVD includes coronary artery diseases (CAD) such as angina and myocardial infarction (commonly known as a heart attack). [2] Other CVDs include stroke , heart failure , hypertensive heart disease , rheumatic heart disease , cardiomyopathy , abnormal heart rhythms , congenital heart disease , valvular heart disease , carditis , aortic aneurysms , peripheral artery disease , thromboembolic disease , and venous thrombosis . [2] [3]
The underlying mechanisms vary depending on the disease. [2] Coronary artery disease, stroke, and peripheral artery disease involve atherosclerosis . [2] This may be caused by high blood pressure , smoking , diabetes mellitus , lack of exercise , obesity , high blood cholesterol , poor diet, and excessive alcohol consumption, among others. [2] High blood pressure is estimated to account for approximately 13% of CVD deaths, while tobacco accounts for 9%, diabetes 6%, lack of exercise 6% and obesity 5%. [2] Rheumatic heart disease may follow untreated strep throat . [2]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cefalexin
Cefalexin , also spelled cephalexin , is an antibiotic that can treat a number of bacterial infections . [4] It kills gram-positive and some gram-negative bacteria by disrupting the growth of the bacterial cell wall. [4] Cefalexin is a beta-lactam antibiotic within the class of first-generation cephalosporins . [4] It works similarly to other agents within this class, including intravenous cefazolin , but can be taken by mouth. [5]
Cefalexin can treat certain bacterial infections, including those of the middle ear , bone and joint , skin , and urinary tract . [4] It may also be used for certain types of pneumonia , strep throat , and to prevent bacterial endocarditis . [4] Cefalexin is not effective against infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), most Enterococcus , or Pseudomonas . [4] Like other antibiotics, cefalexin cannot treat viral infections , such as the flu , common cold or acute bronchitis . [4] Cefalexin can be used in those who have mild or moderate allergies to penicillin . [4] However, it is not recommended in those with severe penicillin allergies. [4]
Common side effects include stomach upset and diarrhea . [4] Allergic reactions or infections with Clostridium difficile , a cause of diarrhea, are also possible. [4] Use during pregnancy or breast feeding does not appear to be harmful to the baby. [4] [6] [7] It can be used in children and those over 65 years of age. [4] Those with kidney problems may require a decrease in dose. [4]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_nervous_system_disease
Central nervous system diseases , also known as central nervous system disorders , are a group of neurological disorders that affect the structure or function of the brain or spinal cord , which collectively form the central nervous system (CNS). [1] [2] [3]
Every disease has different signs and symptoms . Some of them are persistent headache; pain in the face, back, arms, or legs; an inability to concentrate; loss of feeling; memory loss; loss of muscle strength; tremors ; seizures; increased reflexes, spasticity, tics; paralysis; and slurred speech . One should seek medical attention if affected by these.
Any type of traumatic brain injury (TBI) or injury done to the spinal cord can result in a wide spectrum of disabilities in a person. Depending on the section of the brain or spinal cord that suffers the trauma, the outcome may be anticipated.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_venous_catheter


A central venous catheter ( CVC ), also known as a central line , central venous line, or central venous access catheter , is a catheter placed into a large vein . It is a form of venous access . Placement of larger catheters in more centrally located veins is often needed in critically ill patients, or in those requiring prolonged intravenous therapies, for more reliable vascular access. These catheters are commonly placed in veins in the neck ( internal jugular vein ), chest ( subclavian vein or axillary vein ), groin ( femoral vein ), or through veins in the arms (also known as a PICC line , or peripherally inserted central catheters).

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_amyloid_angiopathy
Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), is a form of angiopathy in which amyloid beta peptide deposits in the walls of small to medium blood vessels of the central nervous system and meninges . [2] [3] The term congophilic is sometimes used because the presence of the abnormal aggregations of amyloid can be demonstrated by microscopic examination of brain tissue after staining with Congo red . The amyloid material is only found in the brain and as such the disease is not related to other forms of amyloidosis . [4]
CAA is associated with brain hemorrhages, particularly microhemorrhages. Since CAA can be caused by the same amyloid protein that is associated with Alzheimer's dementia, brain bleeds [5] are more common in people who have a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. However, they can also occur in those who have no history of dementia .  The bleeding within the brain is usually confined to a particular lobe [6] and this is slightly different compared to brain bleeds which occur as a consequence of high blood pressure ( hypertension ) - a more common cause of a hemorrhagic stroke (or bleeding in the brain ). [7]
CAA has been identified as occurring either sporadically (generally in elderly populations) [8] or in familial forms such as Flemish, Iowa, and Dutch types. In all cases, it is defined by the deposition of amyloid beta (Aβ) in the leptomeningal and cerebral vessel walls. [9] CAA occurring in the Flemish type has been observed to be linked to large dense-core plaques observed in this pedigree. [10]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_arteriovenous_malformation
A cerebral arteriovenous malformation ( cerebral AVM , CAVM , cAVM ) is an abnormal connection between the arteries and veins in the brain —specifically, an arteriovenous malformation in the cerebrum .
The most frequently observed problems, related to an AVM, are headaches and seizures , cranial nerve deficits, [1] backaches, neckaches and eventual nausea, as the coagulated blood makes its way down to be dissolved in the individual's spinal fluid. It is supposed that 15% of the population, at detection, have no symptoms at all. [2] Other common symptoms are a pulsing noise in the head, progressive weakness and numbness and vision changes as well as debilitating, excruciating pain. [3] [4]
In serious cases, the blood vessels rupture and there is bleeding within the brain ( intracranial hemorrhage ). Nevertheless, in more than half of patients with AVM, hemorrhage is the first symptom. [5] Symptoms due to bleeding include loss of consciousness, sudden and severe headache, nausea, vomiting, incontinence , and blurred vision, amongst others. [3] Impairments caused by local brain tissue damage on the bleed site are also possible, including seizure, one-sided weakness ( hemiparesis ), a loss of touch sensation on one side of the body and deficits in language processing ( aphasia ). [3] Ruptured AVMs are responsible for considerable mortality and morbidity. [6]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_infarction
A cerebral infarction is an area of necrotic tissue in the brain . It results from a blockage or narrowing in the arteries supplying blood and oxygen to the brain. The restricted oxygen due to the restricted blood supply causes an ischemic stroke , which can result in an infarction if the blood flow is not restored within a relatively short period of time. The blockage can be due to a thrombus , an embolus , or an atheromatous stenosis of one or more arteries . [1] Which arteries are problematic will determine which areas of the brain are affected (infarcted). These varying infarcts will produce different symptoms and outcomes. About one third will prove fatal.
There are various classification systems [2] for a cerebral infarction, some of which are described below.
Symptoms of cerebral infarction are determined by the parts of the brain affected. If the infarct is located in the primary motor cortex , contralateral hemiparesis is said to occur. With brainstem localization, brainstem syndromes are typical: Wallenberg's syndrome , Weber's syndrome , Millard–Gubler syndrome , Benedikt syndrome or others.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrovascular_disease
Cerebrovascular disease includes a variety of medical conditions that affect the blood vessels of the brain and the cerebral circulation . Arteries supplying oxygen and nutrients to the brain are often damaged or deformed in these disorders. [2] The most common presentation of cerebrovascular disease is an ischemic stroke or mini-stroke and sometimes a hemorrhagic stroke . [2] Hypertension (high blood pressure) is the most important contributing risk factor for stroke and cerebrovascular diseases as it can change the structure of blood vessels and result in atherosclerosis . [5] Atherosclerosis narrows blood vessels in the brain, resulting in decreased cerebral perfusion. Other risk factors that contribute to stroke include smoking and diabetes. [6] Narrowed cerebral arteries can lead to ischemic stroke , but continually elevated blood pressure can also cause tearing of vessels, leading to a hemorrhagic stroke. [4]
A stroke usually presents with an abrupt onset of a neurologic deficit – such as hemiplegia (one-sided weakness), numbness, aphasia (language impairment), or ataxia (loss of coordination) – attributable to a focal vascular lesion. [7] The neurologic symptoms manifest within seconds because neurons need a continual supply of nutrients, including glucose and oxygen, that are provided by the blood. Therefore if blood supply to the brain is impeded, injury and energy failure is rapid. [8]
Besides hypertension, there are also many less common causes of cerebrovascular disease, including those that are congenital or idiopathic and include CADASIL , aneurysms , amyloid angiopathy , arteriovenous malformations , fistulas , and arterial dissections . [9] Many of these diseases can be asymptomatic until an acute event, such as a stroke, occurs. [9] Cerebrovascular diseases can also present less commonly with headache or seizures. [10] Any of these diseases can result in vascular dementia due to ischemic damage to the brain. [11] [12]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cesarean_section

Caesarean section , also known as C-section , or caesarean delivery , is the surgical procedure by which one or more babies are delivered through an incision in the mother's abdomen, often performed because vaginal delivery would put the baby or mother at risk. [2] Various Human groups have been attempting and actively doing the caesarean section for 100s to 1000s of years.(note: The earliest group known to practice this operation are the Bunyoro people from northern Uganda who scholars believe have been practicing the operation since their ancient times).Reasons for the operation include obstructed labor , twin pregnancy , high blood pressure in the mother, breech birth , and problems with the placenta or umbilical cord . [2] [3] A caesarean delivery may be performed based upon the shape of the mother's pelvis or history of a previous C-section. [2] [3] A trial of vaginal birth after C-section may be possible. [2] The World Health Organization recommends that caesarean section be performed only when medically necessary. [3] [4] Some C-sections are performed without a medical reason, upon request by someone, usually the mother. [2]
A C-section typically takes 45 minutes to an hour. [2] It may be done with a spinal block , where the woman is awake, or under general anesthesia . [2] A urinary catheter is used to drain the bladder , and the skin of the abdomen is then cleaned with an antiseptic . [2] An incision of about 15 cm (6 inches) is then typically made through the mother's lower abdomen. [2] The uterus is then opened with a second incision and the baby delivered. [2] The incisions are then stitched closed. [2] A woman can typically begin breastfeeding as soon as she is out of the operating room and awake. [5] Often, several days are required in the hospital to recover sufficiently to return home. [2]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_burn
A chemical burn occurs when living tissue is exposed to a corrosive substance (such as a strong acid , base or oxidizer ) or a cytotoxic agent (such as mustard gas , lewisite or arsine ). Chemical burns follow standard burn classification and may cause extensive tissue damage. The main types of irritant and/or corrosive products are: acids, bases, oxidizers / reducing agents, solvents , and alkylants. Additionally, chemical burns can be caused by some types of cytotoxic chemical weapons , e.g., vesicants such as mustard gas and Lewisite , or urticants such as phosgene oxime .
Chemical burns may:
The exact symptoms of a chemical burn depend on the chemical involved. Symptoms include itching, bleaching or darkening of skin, burning sensations, trouble breathing , coughing blood and/or tissue necrosis . Common sources of chemical burns include sulfuric acid (H 2 SO 4 ), hydrochloric acid (HCl) , sodium hydroxide ( Na OH ), lime (CaO), silver nitrate ( Ag NO 3 ), and hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ).  Effects depend on the substance; hydrogen peroxide removes a bleached layer of skin, while nitric acid causes a characteristic color change to yellow in the skin, and silver nitrate produces noticeable black stains.  Chemical burns may occur through direct contact on body surfaces, including skin and eyes, via inhalation, and/or by ingestion. Lipophilic substances that diffuse efficiently in human tissue, e.g., hydrofluoric acid , sulfur mustard , and dimethyl sulfate , may not react immediately, but instead produce the burns and inflammation hours after the contact. Chemical fabrication , mining , medicine , and related professional fields are examples of occupations where chemical burns may occur.  Hydrofluoric acid leaches into the bloodstream, reacts with calcium and magnesium, and the resulting salts can cause cardiac arrest after eating through skin.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiropractic

Chiropractic is a pseudoscientific [1] alternative medicine [2] that is concerned with the diagnosis and treatment of mechanical disorders of the musculoskeletal system , especially the spine . [3] Chiropractors, especially those in the field's early history, have proposed that such disorders affect general health via the nervous system . [3] The main chiropractic treatment technique involves manual therapy , especially manipulation of the spine , other joints, and soft tissues , but may also include exercises and health and lifestyle counseling. [4] A chiropractor may have a Doctor of Chiropractic (D.C.) degree and be referred to as a doctor, and in some jurisdictions can be called a chiropractic physician , but is not a Doctor of Medicine . [5] [6]
Systematic reviews of controlled clinical studies of treatments used by chiropractors have not found evidence that chiropractic manipulation is effective , with the possible exception of treatment for back pain . [7] A critical evaluation found that collectively, spinal manipulation was ineffective at treating any condition. [8] Spinal manipulation may be cost-effective for sub-acute or chronic low back pain but the results for acute low back pain were insufficient. [9] The efficacy and cost-effectiveness of maintenance chiropractic care are unknown. [10]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorpromazine

Chlorpromazine ( CPZ ), marketed under the brand names Thorazine and Largactil among others, is an antipsychotic medication. [4] It is primarily used to treat psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia . [4] Other uses include the treatment of bipolar disorder , severe behavioral problems in children including those with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder , nausea and vomiting , anxiety before surgery, and hiccups that do not improve following other measures. [4] It can be given by mouth , by injection into a muscle , or into a vein . [4]
Chlorpromazine is in the typical antipsychotic class, [4] and, chemically, is one of the phenothiazines . Its mechanism of action is not entirely clear but believed to be related to its ability as a dopamine antagonist . [4] It also has anti-serotonergic and antihistaminergic properties. [4]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choking_game
The Choking game refers to intentionally cutting off oxygen to the brain with the goal of inducing temporary loss of consciousness and euphoria .
Limited research has been conducted regarding motivations for practicing the fainting game, although thrill-seeking has been identified as a risk factor, [1] as has the perception that it is a low-risk activity. [2] Anecdotal reasons stated include:
Reasons for practice are distinct from erotic asphyxiation . Steve Field, chairman of the Royal College of General Practitioners in London, [4] claims that the fainting game is pursued primarily by children and teens "to get a high without taking drugs." Children "aren't playing this game for sexual gratification." It is frequently confused with erotic asphyxiation, which is oxygen deprivation for sexual arousal. Unlike erotic asphyxiation , practice of the fainting game appears to be uncommon in adulthood. [5]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chordoma
Chordoma is a rare slow-growing neoplasm thought to arise from cellular remnants of the notochord . The evidence for this is the location of the tumors (along the neuraxis ), the similar immunohistochemical staining patterns, and the demonstration that notochordal cells are preferentially left behind in the clivus and sacrococcygeal regions when the remainder of the notochord regresses during fetal life.
In layman's terms, chordoma is a type of spinal cancer. [1]
Chordomas can arise from bone in the skull base and anywhere along the spine. The two most common locations are cranially at the clivus and in the sacrum at the bottom of the spine. [2]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chorea
Chorea (or choreia , occasionally) is an abnormal involuntary movement disorder , one of a group of neurological disorders called dyskinesias . The term chorea is derived from the Ancient Greek : χορεία ("dance"; see choreia ), as the quick movements of the feet or hands are comparable to dancing.
The term hemichorea refers to chorea of one side of the body, such as chorea of one arm but not both (analogous to hemiballismus ).
Chorea is characterized by brief, semi-directed, irregular movements that are not repetitive or rhythmic, but appear to flow from one muscle to the next. These 'dance-like' movements of chorea often occur with athetosis , which adds twisting and writhing movements. Walking may become difficult, and include odd postures and leg movements.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic
Chronic may refer to:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_inflammatory_demyelinating_polyneuropathy
Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy is an acquired immune-mediated inflammatory disorder of the peripheral nervous system characterized by progressive weakness and impaired sensory function in the legs and arms. [1] The disorder is sometimes called chronic relapsing polyneuropathy (CRP) or chronic inflammatory demyelinating poly radiculo neuropathy (because it involves the nerve roots). [2] CIDP is closely related to Guillain–Barré syndrome and it is considered the chronic counterpart of that acute disease. [3] Its symptoms are also similar to progressive inflammatory neuropathy .
Several variants have been reported. Specially important are:
Currently there is one special variant in which the CNS is also affected. It is termed "combined central and peripheral demyelination" (CCPD) and is special because it belongs at the same time to the CDIP syndrome and to the multiple sclerosis spectrum. [5] These cases seem to be related to the presence of anti-neurofascin autoantibodies . [ citation needed ]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_lymphocytic_leukemia
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes too many lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell ). [2] [8] Early on there are typically no symptoms. [2] Later non-painful lymph node swelling, feeling tired, fever , night sweats , or weight loss for no clear reason may occur. [2] [9] Enlargement of the spleen and low red blood cells (anemia) may also occur. [2] [4] It typically worsens gradually over years. [2]
Risk factors include having a family history of the disease. [2] Exposure to Agent Orange and certain insecticides might also be a risk. [4] CLL results in the buildup of B cell lymphocytes in the bone marrow, lymph nodes, and blood . [4] These cells do not function well and crowd out healthy blood cells . [2] CLL is divided into two main types: those with a mutated IGHV gene and those without. [4] Diagnosis is typically based on blood tests finding high numbers of mature lymphocytes and smudge cells. [5]
Early-stage CLL in asymptomatic cases responds better to careful observation, as there is no evidence that early intervention treatment can alter the course of the disease. [10] Immune defects occur early in the course of CLL and these increase the risk of developing serious infection, which should be treated appropriately with antibiotics. [10] In those with significant symptoms, chemotherapy or immunotherapy may be used. [4] As of 2019 ibrutinib is often the initial medication recommended. [11] The medications fludarabine , cyclophosphamide , and rituximab were previously the initial treatment in those who are otherwise healthy. [12]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis
Cirrhosis , also known as liver cirrhosis or hepatic cirrhosis , and end-stage liver disease , is the impaired liver function caused by the formation of scar tissue known as fibrosis , due to damage caused by liver disease . [9] Damage causes tissue repair and subsequent formation of scar tissue, which over time can replace normal functioning tissue leading to the impaired liver function of cirrhosis. [9] [10] The disease typically develops slowly over months or years. [1] Early symptoms may include tiredness , weakness , loss of appetite , unexplained weight loss , nausea and vomiting, and discomfort in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. [2] As the disease worsens, symptoms may include itchiness , swelling in the lower legs , fluid build-up in the abdomen , jaundice , bruising easily , and the development of spider-like blood vessels in the skin . [2] The fluid build-up in the abdomen may become spontaneously infected . [1] More serious complications include hepatic encephalopathy , bleeding from dilated veins in the esophagus , stomach or intestines , and liver cancer . [11]
Cirrhosis is most commonly caused by alcoholic liver disease , non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) – (the progressive form of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ), [12] chronic hepatitis B , and chronic hepatitis C . [2] [4] Heavy drinking over a number of years can cause alcoholic liver disease. [13] NASH has a number of causes, including obesity , high blood pressure , abnormal levels of cholesterol , type 2 diabetes , and metabolic syndrome . [3] Less common causes of cirrhosis include autoimmune hepatitis , primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis that disrupt bile duct function, genetic disorders such as Wilson's disease and hereditary hemochromatosis , and chronic heart failure with liver congestion . [2]
Diagnosis is based on blood tests , medical imaging , and liver biopsy . [5] [1]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citalopram

Citalopram , sold under the brand name Celexa among others, is an antidepressant of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) class. [4] [5] It is used to treat major depressive disorder , obsessive compulsive disorder , panic disorder , and social phobia . [4] The antidepressant effects may take one to four weeks to occur. [4] It is taken by mouth. [4] [5]
Common side effects include nausea, trouble sleeping, sexual problems, shakiness, feeling tired, and sweating. [4] Serious side effects include an increased risk of suicide in those under the age of 25, serotonin syndrome , glaucoma , and QT prolongation . [4] It should not be used in someone on a MAO inhibitor . [4] Antidepressant discontinuation syndrome may occur when stopped. [4] There are concerns that use during pregnancy may harm the fetus. [3]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clear-cell_sarcoma
Clear cell sarcoma is a rare form of cancer called a sarcoma . [1] It is known to occur mainly in the soft tissues and dermis. Rare forms were thought to occur in the gastrointestinal tract before they were discovered to be different and redesignated as GNET .
Recurrence is common. [2]
It has been associated with both EWSR1 - ATF1 and EWSR1 - CREB1 fusion transcripts. [3]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_thermometer
A medical thermometer (also called clinical thermometer ) is used for measuring human or animal body temperature . The tip of the thermometer is inserted into the mouth under the tongue ( oral or sub-lingual temperature ), under the armpit ( axillary temperature ), into the rectum via the anus ( rectal temperature ), into the ear ( tympanic temperature ), or on the forehead ( temporal temperature ).
The medical thermometer began as an instrument more appropriately called a water thermoscope , constructed by Galileo Galilei circa 1592–1593. It lacked an accurate scale with which to measure temperature and could be affected by changes in atmospheric pressure. [1] [2]
Italian physician Santorio Santorio is the first known individual to have put a measurable scale on the thermoscope and wrote of it in 1625, though he possibly invented one as early as 1612. His models were bulky, impractical and took a fair amount of time to take an accurate oral reading of the patient's temperature. [1] [2]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clonazepam
Clonazepam , sold under the brand Klonopin among others, is a medication used to prevent and treat seizures , panic disorder , and the movement disorder known as akathisia . [9] It is a tranquilizer of the benzodiazepine class. [9] It is taken by mouth. [9] Effects begin within one hour and last between six and twelve hours. [7]
Common side effects include sleepiness, poor coordination, and agitation. [9] Long-term use may result in tolerance , dependence , and withdrawal symptoms if stopped abruptly. [9] Dependence occurs in one-third of people who take clonazepam for longer than four weeks. [8] There is an increased risk of suicide , particularly in people who are already depressed. [9] [10] If used during pregnancy it may result in harm to the fetus. [9] Clonazepam binds to GABA A receptors , thus increasing the effect of the chief inhibitory neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA). [8]
Clonazepam was patented in 1960 and went on sale in 1975 in the United States from Roche . [11] [12] It is available as a generic medication . [9] In 2018, it was the 47th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 17 million prescriptions. [13] [14] In many areas of the world it is commonly used as a recreational drug . [15] [16]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clonus
Clonus is a set of involuntary and rhythmic muscular contractions and relaxations. Clonus is a sign of certain neurological conditions, particularly associated with upper motor neuron lesions involving descending motor pathways, and in many cases is, accompanied by spasticity (another form of hyperexcitability). [1] Unlike small, spontaneous twitches known as fasciculations (usually caused by lower motor neuron pathology), clonus causes large motions that are usually initiated by a reflex . Studies have shown clonus beat frequency to range from three to eight Hz on average, and may last a few seconds to several minutes depending on the patient’s condition. [1] The term is from the Greek for "violent, confused motion"
Clonus is most commonly found at the ankle, specifically with a dorsiflexion/plantarflexion movement (up and down). [2] Some case studies have also reported clonus in the finger, toe, and laterally in the ankle (as opposed to the typical up and down motion). [3] [4]
Clonus is typically seen in people with cerebral palsy , stroke , multiple sclerosis , spinal cord damage and hepatic encephalopathy . [2] It can occur in epilepsy as part of a generalized tonic–clonic seizure . It can also be an adverse drug reaction , such as after ingestion of potent serotonergic drugs, where clonus strongly predicts imminent serotonin toxicity ( serotonin syndrome ).

Clostridioides difficile infection ( CDI or C-diff ), also known as Clostridium difficile infection , is a symptomatic infection due to the spore -forming bacterium Clostridioides difficile . [2] [5] Symptoms include watery diarrhea , fever, nausea, and abdominal pain . [1] It makes up about 20% of cases of antibiotic-associated diarrhea . [1] Antibiotics can contribute to detrimental changes in gut microbiota; specifically, they decrease short-chain fatty acid absorption which results in osmotic, or watery, diarrhea. [6] Complications may include pseudomembranous colitis , toxic megacolon , perforation of the colon , and sepsis . [1]
Clostridioides difficile infection is spread by bacterial spores found within feces . [1] Surfaces may become contaminated with the spores with further spread occurring via the hands of healthcare workers. [1] Risk factors for infection include antibiotic or proton pump inhibitor use, hospitalization, other health problems, and older age. [1] Diagnosis is by stool culture or testing for the bacteria's DNA or toxins . [1] If a person tests positive but has no symptoms, the condition is known as C. difficile colonization rather than an infection. [1]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colic
Colic is a form of pain that starts and stops abruptly. It occurs due to muscular contractions of a hollow tube (colon, gall bladder , ureter , etc.) in an attempt to relieve an obstruction by forcing content out. It may be accompanied by sweating and vomiting . [1] Types include:
The term is from Greek κολικός kolikos , "relative to the colon ".
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coma
A coma is a deep state of prolonged unconsciousness in which a person cannot be awakened, fails to respond normally to painful stimuli, light, or sound, lacks a normal wake-sleep cycle and does not initiate voluntary actions. [2] Coma patients exhibit a complete absence of wakefulness and are unable to consciously feel, speak or move. [3] Comas can be derived by natural causes, or can be medically induced .
Clinically, a coma can be defined as the inability consistently to follow a one-step command. [4] It can also be defined as a score of ≤ 8 on the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) lasting ≥ 6 hours. For a patient to maintain consciousness, the components of wakefulness and awareness must be maintained. Wakefulness describes the quantitative degree of consciousness , whereas awareness relates to the qualitative aspects of the functions mediated by the cortex, including cognitive abilities such as attention, sensory perception, explicit memory, language, the execution of tasks, temporal and spatial orientation and reality judgment. [3] [5] From a neurological perspective, consciousness is maintained by the activation of the cerebral cortex —the gray matter that forms the outer layer of the brain and by the reticular activating system (RAS), a structure located within the brainstem . [6] [7]
The term 'coma', from the Greek κῶμα koma , meaning deep sleep, had already been used in the Hippocratic corpus ( Epidemica ) and later by Galen (second century AD). Subsequently, it was hardly used in the known literature up to the middle of the 17th century. The term is found again in Thomas Willis ' (1621–1675) influential De anima brutorum (1672), where lethargy (pathological sleep), 'coma' (heavy sleeping), carus (deprivation of the senses) and apoplexy (into which carus could turn and which he localized in the white matter ) are mentioned. The term carus is also derived from Greek, where it can be found in the roots of several words meaning soporific or sleepy. It can still be found in the root of the term 'carotid'. Thomas Sydenham (1624–89) mentioned the term 'coma' in several cases of fever (Sydenham, 1685). [8] [9]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity
In medicine , comorbidity is the presence of one or more additional conditions often co-occurring (that is, concomitant or concurrent ) with a primary condition. Comorbidity describes the effect of all other conditions an individual patient might have other than the primary condition of interest, and can be physiological or psychological. In the context of mental health, comorbidity often refers to disorders that are often coexistent with each other, such as depression and anxiety disorders.
Comorbidity can indicate either a condition existing simultaneously, but independently with another condition or a related medical condition. The latter sense of the term causes some overlap with the concept of complications . For example, in longstanding diabetes mellitus , the extent to which coronary artery disease is an independent comorbidity versus a diabetic complication is not easy to measure, because both diseases are quite multivariate and there are likely aspects of both simultaneity and consequence. The same is true of intercurrent diseases in pregnancy . In other examples, the true independence or relation is not ascertainable because syndromes and associations are often identified long before pathogenetic commonalities are confirmed (and, in some examples, before they are even hypothesized ). In psychiatric diagnoses it has been argued in part that this "'use of imprecise language may lead to correspondingly imprecise thinking', [and] this usage of the term 'comorbidity' should probably be avoided." [1] However, in many medical examples, such as comorbid diabetes mellitus and coronary artery disease, it makes little difference which word is used, as long as the medical complexity is duly recognized and addressed.
Many tests attempt to standardize the "weight" or value of comorbid conditions, whether they are secondary or tertiary illnesses. Each test attempts to consolidate each individual comorbid condition into a single, predictive variable that measures mortality or other outcomes. Researchers have validated such tests because of their predictive value, but no one test is as yet recognized as a  standard.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compulsory_sterilization

Compulsory sterilization , also known as forced or coerced sterilization , is a government-mandated program to sterilize a specific group of people. Compulsory sterilization removes a person’s capacity to reproduce, usually through surgical procedures. Several countries implemented sterilization programs in the early 20th century. [1] Although such programs have been made illegal in most countries of the world, instances of forced or coerced sterilizations persist.
Rationalizations for compulsory sterilization have included population control , gender discrimination , limiting the spread of HIV , [2] "gender-normalizing" surgeries for intersex people, and ethnic genocide . In some countries, transgender individuals are required to undergo sterilization before gaining legal recognition of their gender , a practice that the United Nations Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment has described as a violation of the Yogyakarta Principles .

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_bypass_surgery
Coronary artery bypass surgery , also known as coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG , pronounced "cabbage") surgery , and colloquially heart bypass or bypass surgery , is a surgical procedure to restore normal blood flow to an obstructed coronary artery . A normal coronary artery transports blood to the heart muscle itself, not through the main circulatory system .
There are two main approaches. In one, the left internal thoracic artery , LITA (also called left internal mammary artery, LIMA) is diverted to the left anterior descending branch of the left coronary artery . In this method, the artery is " pedicled " which means it is not detached from the origin. In the other, a great saphenous vein is removed from a leg; one end is attached to the aorta or one of its major branches, and the other end is attached to the obstructed artery immediately after the obstruction to restore blood flow.
CABG is performed to relieve angina unsatisfactorily controlled by maximum tolerated anti-ischemic medication, prevent or relieve left ventricular dysfunction , and/or reduce the risk of death. CABG does not prevent myocardial infarction (heart attack). This surgery is usually performed with the heart stopped, necessitating the usage of cardiopulmonary bypass . However, two alternative techniques are also available, allowing CABG to be performed on a beating heart either without using the cardiopulmonary bypass, a procedure referred to as "off-pump" surgery, or performing beating surgery using partial assistance of the cardiopulmonary bypass, a procedure referred to as "on-pump beating" surgery. The latter procedure offers the advantages of the on-pump stopped and off-pump while minimizing their respective side-effects.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVAX

COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access , abbreviated as COVAX , is a worldwide initiative aimed at equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines directed by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance (formerly the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization, or GAVI),  the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), and the World Health Organization (WHO).  It is one of the three pillars of the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator , an initiative begun in April 2020 by the WHO, the European Commission , and the government of France as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic . COVAX coordinates international resources to enable low-to-middle-income countries equitable access to COVID-19 tests , therapies , and vaccines . [1] By 15 July 2020, 165 countries – representing 60% of the human population – had joined COVAX. [2] However, as of 11 April 2021, COVAX is falling short of its goal, having delivered 38.5 million doses despite a goal of 100 million by the end of March. [3] [4]
As of 9 May 2021, the WHO has approved the Oxford–AstraZeneca , the Pfizer–BioNTech , the Moderna as well as the Sinopharm BBIBP-CorV and Johnson & Johnson vaccines for emergency use. [5] These vaccines can be distributed as part of COVAX. [5] [6]

Cow urine is a liquid by-product of metabolism in cows. Cow urine is also used in medicine in India , Myanmar , Nepal , and Nigeria . While cow urine and cow dung have benefits as fertilizers, the proponents' claims about its curing diseases and cancer have no scientific backing. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5]
Some Hindus claim that cow urine has a special significance as a medicinal drink. [6] [1] The sprinkling of cow urine is said to have a spiritual cleansing effect as well. [7] [8]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cremaster_muscle
The cremaster muscle is a muscle that covers the testis and the spermatic cord .
In human males , the cremaster muscle is a thin layer of striated muscle found in the inguinal canal and scrotum between the external and internal layers of spermatic fascia , surrounding the testis and spermatic cord .  The cremaster muscle is a paired structure, there being one on each side of the body.
Anatomically, the lateral cremaster muscle originates from the internal oblique muscle, just superior to the inguinal canal , and the middle of the inguinal ligament. The medial cremaster muscle, which sometimes is absent, originates from the pubic tubercle and sometimes the lateral pubic crest. Both insert into the tunica vaginalis underneath the testis.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryotherapy
Cryotherapy , sometimes known as cold therapy , is the local or general use of low temperatures in medical therapy . Cryotherapy may be used to treat a variety of tissue lesions . [1] The most prominent use of the term refers to the surgical treatment, specifically known as cryosurgery or cryoablation . Cryosurgery is the application of extremely low temperatures to destroy abnormal or diseased tissue and is used most commonly to treat skin conditions.
Cryotherapy is used in an effort to relieve muscle pain, sprains and swelling after soft tissue damage or surgery. It is commonly used to accelerate recovery in athletes post exercise for decades. Scientifically, cryotherapy decreases the temperature of tissue surface to minimize hypoxic cell death, edema accumulation, and muscle spasms, all of which ultimately alleviate discomfort and inflammation. [2] It can be a range of treatments from the application of ice packs or immersion in ice baths (generally known as cold therapy), to the use of cold chambers.
While cryotherapy is widely used, there is little evidence as to its efficacy that has been replicated or shown in large controlled studies. Its long term side effects have also not been studied. [3] [4] However, there is a study that concludes that cryotherapy has a positive impact on the short-term recovery of athletes. Cryotherapy help manage muscle soreness and facilitate recovery within the first 24 hours following a sport-related activity. Athletes who use cryotherapy within the first 24 hours to alleviate pain recovered at a faster rate than athletes who did not use cryotherapy after their sport-related activity. [5]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclophosphamide
Cyclophosphamide ( CP ), also known as cytophosphane among other names, [3] is a medication used as chemotherapy and to suppress the immune system . [4] As chemotherapy it is used to treat lymphoma , multiple myeloma , leukemia , ovarian cancer , breast cancer , small cell lung cancer , neuroblastoma , and sarcoma . [4] As an immune suppressor it is used in nephrotic syndrome , granulomatosis with polyangiitis , and following organ transplant , among other conditions. [4] [5] It is taken by mouth or injection into a vein . [4]
Most people develop side effects. [4] Common side effects include low white blood cell counts , loss of appetite, vomiting, hair loss , and bleeding from the bladder . [4] Other severe side effects include an increased future risk of cancer, infertility , allergic reactions , and pulmonary fibrosis . [4] Cyclophosphamide is in the alkylating agent and nitrogen mustard family of medications. [4] It is believed to work by interfering with the duplication of DNA and the creation of RNA . [4]
Cyclophosphamide was approved for medical use in the United States in 1959. [4] It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines . [6]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclothymia
Cyclothymia , also known as cyclothymic disorder is a mental disorder that involves numerous periods of symptoms of depression and periods of symptoms of elevated mood. [3] These symptoms, however, are not sufficient to be a major depressive episode or a hypomanic episode . [3] Symptoms must last for more than one year in children and two years in adults. [3]
The cause of cyclothymia is unknown. [2] Risk factors include a family history of bipolar disorder . [3] Cyclothymia differs from bipolar in that major depression, mania , or hypomania have never occurred. [3]
Treatment is generally with counseling and mood stabilizers such as lithium . [4] It is estimated that 0.4-1% of people have cyclothymia at some point in their life. [3] Onset is typically in late childhood to early adulthood. [3] Males and females are affected equally often. [3]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst
A cyst is a closed sac, having a distinct envelope and division compared with the nearby tissue . Hence, it is a cluster of cells that have grouped together to form a sac (like the manner in which water molecules group together to form a bubble); however, the distinguishing aspect of a cyst is that the cells forming the "shell" of such a sac are distinctly abnormal (in both appearance and behaviour) when compared with all surrounding cells for that given location. A cyst may contain air, fluids, or semi-solid material. A collection of pus is called an abscess , not a cyst. Once formed, a cyst may resolve on its own. When a cyst fails to resolve, it may need to be removed surgically , but that would depend upon its type and location.
Cancer -related cysts are formed as a defense mechanism for the body following the development of mutations that lead to an uncontrolled cellular division . Once that mutation has occurred, the affected cells divide incessantly and become cancerous, forming a tumor . The body encapsulates those cells to try to prevent them from continuing their division and contain the tumor, which becomes known as a cyst. That said, the cancerous cells still may mutate further and gain the ability to form their own blood vessels , from which they receive nourishment before being contained. Once that happens, the capsule becomes useless, and the tumor may advance from benign to cancerous.
Some cysts are neoplastic , and thus are called cystic tumors . Many types of cysts are not neoplastic, they are dysplastic or metaplastic . Pseudocysts are similar to cysts in that they have a sac filled with fluid, but lack an epithelial lining.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cysticercosis
Cysticercosis is a tissue infection caused by the young form of the pork tapeworm . [6] [1] People may have few or no symptoms for years. [3] [2] In some cases, particularly in Asia, solid lumps of between one and two centimetres may develop under the skin. [1] After months or years these lumps can become painful and swollen and then resolve. [3] [2] A specific form called neurocysticercosis , which affects the brain , can cause neurological symptoms. [2] In developing countries this is one of the most common causes of seizures . [2]
Cysticercosis is usually acquired by eating food or drinking water contaminated by tapeworm eggs from human feces . [1] Among foods, uncooked vegetables are the major source. [1] The tapeworm eggs are present in the feces of a person infected with the adult worms, a condition known as taeniasis . [2] [7] Taeniasis, in the strict sense, is a different disease and is due to eating cysts in poorly cooked pork. [1] People who live with someone with the pork tapeworm have a greater risk of getting cysticercosis. [7] The diagnosis can be made by aspiration of a cyst. [2] Taking pictures of the brain with computer tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are most useful for the diagnosis of disease in the brain. [2] An increased number of a type of white blood cell , called eosinophils , in the cerebral spinal fluid and blood is also an indicator. [2]
Infection can be effectively prevented by personal hygiene and sanitation : [1] this includes cooking pork well, proper toilets and sanitary practices, and improved access to clean water. [1] Treating those with taeniasis is important to prevent spread. [1] Treating the disease when it does not involve the nervous system may not be required. [2] Treatment of those with neurocysticercosis may be with the medications praziquantel or albendazole . [1] These may be required for long periods. [1] Steroids , for anti-inflammation during treatment, and anti-seizure medications may also be required. [1] Surgery is sometimes done to remove the cysts. [1]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dacarbazine
Dacarbazine ( DTIC ), [1] also known as imidazole carboxamide , is a chemotherapy medication used in the treatment of melanoma and Hodgkin's lymphoma . [2] For Hodgkin's it is often used together with vinblastine , bleomycin , and doxorubicin . [2] It is given by injection into a vein . [2]
Common side effects include loss of appetite, vomiting, low white blood cell count , and low platelets . [2] Other serious side effects include liver problems and allergic reactions . [2] It is unclear if use in pregnancy is safe for the baby. [2] Dacarbazine is in the alkylating agent and purine analog families of medication. [2]
Dacarbazine was approved for medical use in the United States in 1975. [2] It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines . [3]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Date_rape_drug
A date rape drug is any drug that incapacitates another person and renders that person vulnerable to a sexual assault , including rape . The substances are associated with date rape because of reported incidents of their use in the context of two people dating, during which the victim is sexually assaulted or raped or suffers other harm. The substances are not exclusively used to perpetrate sexual assault or rape, but are the properties or side-effects of substances normally used for legitimate medical purposes. One of the most common incapacitating agents for date rape is alcohol , administered either surreptitiously [1] or consumed voluntarily, [2] rendering the victim unable to make informed decisions or give consent.
No comprehensive data exists on the frequency of drug-facilitated sexual assaults involving the use of surreptitious drug administration, due to the report rate of assaults and because rape victims who do report are often either never tested for these drugs, are tested for the wrong ones, or the tests are administered after the drug has been metabolized and left their body. [3]
A 1999 study of 1,179 urine specimens from victims of suspected drug-facilitated sexual assaults in 49 American states found six (0.5%) positive for Rohypnol , 97 (8%) positive for other benzodiazepines, 48 (4.1%) positive for GHB , 451 (38%) positive for alcohol and 468 (40%) negative for any of the drugs searched for. [4] A similar study of 2,003 urine samples of victims of suspected drug-facilitated sexual assaults found less than 2% tested positive for Rohypnol or GHB. [5] The samples used in these studies could only be verified as having been submitted within a 72-hour time frame or a 48-hour time frame.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_by_natural_causes
In many legal jurisdictions , the manner of death is a determination, typically made by the coroner , medical examiner , police, or similar officials, and recorded as a vital statistic .  Within the United States and the United Kingdom, a distinction is made between the cause of death (sometimes referred to as the "mechanism of death"), which is a specific disease or injury, versus manner of death, which is primarily a legal determination. Different categories are used in different jurisdictions, but manner of death determinations include everything from very broad categories like "natural" and "homicide" to specific manners like "traffic accident" or "gunshot wound".  In some cases an autopsy is performed, either due to general legal requirements, because the medical cause of death is uncertain, upon the request of family members or guardians, or because the circumstances of death were suspicious.
International Classification of Disease (ICD) codes can be used to record manner and cause of death in a systematic way that makes it easy to compile statistics and more feasible to compare events across jurisdictions. [1]
A death by natural causes results from an illness or an internal malfunction of the body not directly caused by external forces, other than infectious disease .  For example, a person dying from complications from influenza and/or pneumonia (infections), a stroke , a heart attack (internal body malfunctions), or sudden heart failure would most likely be listed as having died from natural causes.  "Death by natural causes" is sometimes used as a euphemism for "dying of old age", which is considered problematic as a cause of death (as opposed to a specific age-related disease ); there are also many non-age-related causes of "natural" death, for legal manner-of-death purposes.  (See Cause of death § Age )
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decongestant
A decongestant , or nasal decongestant , is a type of pharmaceutical drug that is used to relieve nasal congestion in the upper respiratory tract . The active ingredient in most decongestants is either pseudoephedrine or phenylephrine (the latter of which has disputed effectiveness ). Intranasal corticosteroids can also be used as decongestants and antihistamines can be used to alleviate runny nose , nasal itch , and sneezing . [1]
Topical decongestants on topical application as dilute solution (0.05–0.1%) produce local vasoconstriction .
Regular use of decongestants for long periods should be avoided because mucosal ciliary function is impaired: atrophic rhinitis and anosmia (loss of the sense of smell) can occur due to persistent vasoconstriction.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defibrillation
Defibrillation is a treatment for life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias , specifically ventricular fibrillation (VF) and non-perfusing ventricular tachycardia (VT). [1] [2] A defibrillator delivers a dose of electric current (often called a counter-shock ) to the heart . Although not fully understood, this process depolarizes a large amount of the heart muscle , ending the dysrhythmia. Subsequently, the body's natural pacemaker in the sinoatrial node of the heart is able to re-establish normal sinus rhythm . [3] A heart which is in asystole (flatline) cannot be restarted by a defibrillator, but would be treated by cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).
In contrast to defibrillation, synchronized electrical cardioversion is an electrical shock delivered in synchrony to the cardiac cycle . [4] Although the person may still be critically ill , cardioversion normally aims to end poorly perfusing cardiac dysrhythmias , such as supraventricular tachycardia . [1] [2]
Defibrillators can be external, transvenous, or implanted ( implantable cardioverter-defibrillator ), depending on the type of device used or needed. [5] Some external units, known as automated external defibrillators (AEDs), automate the diagnosis of treatable rhythms, meaning that lay responders or bystanders are able to use them successfully with little or no training. [2]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degenerative_disease
Degenerative disease is the result of a continuous process based on degenerative cell changes, affecting tissues or organs , which will increasingly deteriorate over time. [1]
In neurodegenerative diseases , cells of the central nervous system stop working or die via neurodegeneration . An example of this is Alzheimer's disease . [2] The other two common groups of degenerative diseases are those that affect circulatory system (e.g. coronary artery disease ) and neoplastic diseases (e.g. cancers ). [1]
Many degenerative diseases exist and some are related to aging . Normal bodily wear or lifestyle choices (such as exercise or eating habits) may worsen degenerative diseases, but this depends on the disease. [1] Sometimes the main or partial cause behind such diseases is genetic . [3] Thus some are clearly hereditary like Huntington's disease . [4] Sometimes the cause is viruses , poisons or other chemicals. The cause may also be unknown. [3]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delusion

A delusion is a fixed belief that is not amenable to change in light of conflicting evidence. [1] As a pathology, it is distinct from a belief based on false or incomplete information, confabulation , dogma , illusion , or some other misleading effects of perception as individuals with these beliefs are able to change or readjust their beliefs upon viewing the evidence for these beliefs.
Delusions have been found to occur in the context of many pathological states (both general physical and mental) and are of particular diagnostic importance in psychotic disorders including schizophrenia , paraphrenia , manic episodes of bipolar disorder , and psychotic depression .
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_braces
Dental braces (also known as braces , orthodontic cases , or cases ) are devices used in orthodontics that align and straighten teeth and help  position them with regard to a person's bite, while also aiming to improve dental health. Braces also fix gaps. They are often used to correct underbites , as well as malocclusions , overbites , open bites, deep bites , cross bites , crooked teeth, and various other flaws of the teeth and jaw . Braces can be either cosmetic or structural. Dental braces are often used in conjunction with other orthodontic appliances to help widen the palate or jaws and to otherwise assist in shaping the teeth and jaws.
The application of braces moves the teeth as a result of force and pressure on the teeth. There are traditionally four basic elements used: brackets, bonding material, arch wire, and ligature elastic (also called an “O-ring”). The teeth move when the arch wire puts pressure on the brackets and teeth. Sometimes springs or rubber bands are used to put more force in a specific direction. [ medical citation needed ] [1]
Braces have constant pressure which, over time, move teeth into the desired positions. The process loosens the tooth after which new bone grows in to support the tooth in its new position. This is called bone remodeling . Bone remodeling is a biomechanical process responsible for making bones stronger in response to sustained load-bearing activity and weaker in the absence of carrying a load. Bones are made of cells called osteoclasts and osteoblasts. Two different kinds of bone resorption are possible: direct resorption, which starts from the lining cells of the alveolar bone, and indirect or retrograde resorption, which occurs when the periodontal ligament has been subjected to an excessive amount and duration of compressive stress. [2] Another important factor associated with tooth movement is bone deposition. Bone deposition occurs in the distracted periodontal ligament. Without bone deposition, the tooth will loosen, and voids will occur distal to the direction of tooth movement. [3]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry

Dentistry , also known as dental medicine and oral medicine , is a branch of medicine that consists of the study, diagnosis , prevention, and treatment of diseases , disorders, and conditions of the oral cavity , commonly in the dentition but also the oral mucosa , and of adjacent and related structures and tissues, particularly in the maxillofacial (jaw and facial) area. [1] Although primarily associated with teeth among the general public, the field of dentistry or dental medicine is not limited to teeth but includes other aspects of the craniofacial complex including the temporomandibular joint and other supporting, muscular, lymphatic, nervous, vascular, and anatomical structures.
Dentistry is often also understood to subsume the now largely defunct medical specialty of stomatology (the study of the mouth and its disorders and diseases) for which reason the two terms are used interchangeably in certain regions. [ where? ]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentures
Dentures (also known as false teeth ) are prosthetic devices constructed to replace missing teeth , and are supported by the surrounding soft and hard tissues of the oral cavity . Conventional dentures are removable ( removable partial denture or complete denture ). However, there are many denture designs, some which rely on bonding or clasping onto teeth or dental implants ( fixed prosthodontics ). There are two main categories of dentures, the distinction being whether they are used to replace missing teeth on the mandibular arch or on the maxillary arch .
Dentures do not feel like real teeth, nor do they function like real teeth. [ citation needed ]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_personality_disorder
Dependent personality disorder ( DPD ) is a personality disorder that is characterized by a pervasive psychological dependence on other people. This personality disorder is a long-term condition [1] in which people depend on others to meet their emotional and physical needs, with only a minority achieving normal levels of independence. Dependent personality disorder is a Cluster C personality disorder , [2] characterized by excessive fear and anxiety. It begins by early adulthood, and it is present in a variety of contexts and is associated with inadequate functioning. Symptoms can include anything from extreme passivity, devastation or helplessness when relationships end, avoidance of responsibilities and severe submission.
People who have dependent personality disorder are overdependent on other people when it comes to making decisions. They cannot make a decision on their own as they need constant approval from other people. Consequently, individuals diagnosed with DPD tend to place needs and opinions of others above their own as they do not have the confidence to trust their decisions. This kind of behaviour can explain why people with DPD tend to show passive and clingy behaviour. These individuals display a fear of separation and cannot stand being alone. When alone, they experience feelings of isolation and loneliness due to their overwhelming dependence on other people. Generally people with DPD are also pessimistic: they expect the worst out of situations or believe that the worst will happen. They tend to be more introverted and are more sensitive to criticism and fear rejection. [3]
People with a history of neglect and an abusive upbringing are more susceptible to develop DPD, specifically those involved in long-term abusive relationships. Those with overprotective or authoritarian parents are also more at risk to develop DPD. Having a family history of anxiety disorder can play a role in the development of DPD as a 2004 twin study found a 0.81 heritability for personality disorders collectively. [4]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depressant
A depressant , or central depressant , is a drug that lowers neurotransmission levels, which is to depress or reduce arousal or stimulation , in various areas of the brain. [1] Depressants are also occasionally referred to as "downers" as they lower the level of arousal when taken. Stimulants or "uppers" increase mental and/or physical function, hence the opposite drug class of depressants is stimulants, not antidepressants .
Depressants are widely used throughout the world as prescription medicines and as illicit substances . Alcohol is a very prominent depressant. Alcohol can be and is more likely to be a large problem among teenagers and young adults. When depressants are used, effects often include ataxia , anxiolysis , pain relief , sedation or somnolence , and cognitive / memory impairment , as well as in some instances euphoria , dissociation , muscle relaxation , lowered blood pressure or heart rate , respiratory depression , and anticonvulsant effects. Depressants also act to produce anesthesia . Cannabis may sometimes be considered a depressant due to one of its components, cannabidiol . The latter is known to treat insomnia, anxiety and muscle spasms similar to other depressive drugs. However, tetrahydrocannabinol , another component, may slow brain function to a small degree while reducing reaction to stimuli, it is generally considered to be a stimulant and main psychoactive agent to sometimes cause anxiety , panic and psychosis instead. Other depressants can include drugs like Xanax (a benzodiazepine ) and a number of opiates .
Depressants exert their effects through a number of different pharmacological mechanisms, the most prominent of which include facilitation of GABA , and inhibition of glutamatergic or monoaminergic activity. Other examples are chemicals that modify the electrical signaling inside the body, the most prominent of these being bromides and body blockers .

Derealization is an alteration in the perception of the external world, causing sufferers to perceive it as unreal, distant, distorted or falsified. Other symptoms include feeling as though one's environment is lacking in spontaneity, emotional coloring, and depth. [1] It is a dissociative symptom that may appear in moments of severe stress. [2]
Derealization is a subjective experience pertaining to a person's perception of the outside world, while depersonalization is a related symptom characterized by dissociation towards one's own body and mental processes. The two are commonly experienced in conjunction with one another, but are also known to occur independently. [3]
Chronic derealization is fairly rare, and may be caused by occipital – temporal dysfunction. [4] Experiencing derealization for long periods of time or having recurring episodes can be indicative of many psychological disorders, and can cause significant distress among sufferers. However, temporary derealization symptoms are commonly experienced by the general population a few times throughout their lives, with a lifetime prevalence of up to 26-74% and a prevalence of 31–66% at the time of a traumatic event . [5]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatology
Dermatology is the branch of medicine dealing with the skin . [1] [2] It is a speciality with both medical and surgical aspects. [3] [4] [5] A dermatologist is a specialist medical doctor who manages diseases related to skin, hair, nails, and some cosmetic problems. [2] [6]
Attested in English in 1819, the word "dermatology" derives from the Greek δέρματος ( dermatos ), genitive of δέρμα ( derma ), "skin" [7] (itself from δέρω dero , "to flay" [8] ) and -λογία -logia . Neo-Latin dermatologia was coined in 1630, an anatomical term with various French and German uses attested from the 1730s. [9]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detoxification
Detoxification or detoxication ( detox for short) [1] is the physiological or medicinal removal of toxic substances from a living organism , including the human body, which is mainly carried out by the liver. Additionally, it can refer to the period of drug withdrawal during which an organism returns to homeostasis after long-term use of an addictive substance. [2] [3] In medicine , detoxification can be achieved by decontamination of poison ingestion and the use of antidotes as well as techniques such as dialysis and (in a limited number of cases) chelation therapy . [4]
Many alternative medicine practitioners promote various types of detoxification such as detoxification diets . Scientists have described these as a "waste of time and money". [5] [6] Sense About Science , a UK-based charitable trust, determined that most such dietary "detox" claims lack any supporting evidence. [7] [8]
The liver and kidney are naturally capable of detox, as are intracellular (specifically, inner membrane of mitochondria or in the endoplasmic reticulum of cells) proteins such as CYP enyzmes . In cases of kidney failure , the action of the kidneys is mimicked by dialysis ; kidney and liver transplants are also used for kidney and liver failure, respectively.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dextromethorphan
Dextromethorphan , often referred to as DXM , is a medication most often used as a cough suppressant in over-the-counter cold and cough medicines. It is sold in syrup , tablet, spray, and lozenge forms.
It is in the morphinan class of medications with sedative , dissociative , and stimulant properties (at lower doses). Dextromethorphan does not have a significant affinity for the mu-opioid receptor activity typical of morphinan compounds and exerts its therapeutic effects through several other receptors. [3] In its pure form, dextromethorphan occurs as a white powder. [4]
Dextromethorphan is also used recreationally . When exceeding approved dosages, dextromethorphan acts as a dissociative hallucinogen . It has multiple mechanisms of action , including actions as a nonselective serotonin reuptake inhibitor [5] and a sigma-1 receptor agonist. [6] [7] Dextromethorphan and its major metabolite , dextrorphan , also block the NMDA receptor at high doses, which produces effects similar to other dissociative anesthetics such as ketamine , nitrous oxide , and phencyclidine .
It was patented in 1949 and approved for medical use in 1953. [8]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_and_Statistical_Manual_of_Mental_Disorders
The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( DSM ; latest edition: DSM-5 , publ. 2013) is a publication by the American Psychiatric Association (APA) for the classification of mental disorders using a common language and standard criteria.
It is used - mainly in the USA - by clinicians, researchers, psychiatric drug regulation agencies, health insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies , the legal system, and policymakers.
The DSM evolved from systems for collecting census and psychiatric hospital statistics, as well as from a United States Army manual. Revisions since its first publication in 1952 have incrementally added to the total number of mental disorders , while removing those no longer considered to be mental disorders.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_behavior_therapy

Dialectical behavior therapy ( DBT ) is an evidence-based [1] psychotherapy that began with efforts to treat borderline personality disorder (also known as Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder). [2] There is evidence that DBT can be useful in treating mood disorders , suicidal ideation , and for change in behavioral patterns such as self-harm and substance use . [3] DBT evolved into a process in which the therapist and client work with acceptance and change-oriented strategies, and ultimately balance and synthesize them, in a manner comparable to the philosophical dialectical process of hypothesis and antithesis, followed by synthesis. [2]
This approach was developed by Marsha M. Linehan , a psychology researcher at the University of Washington , to help people increase their emotional and cognitive regulation by learning about the triggers that lead to reactive states and helping to assess which coping skills to apply in the sequence of events, thoughts, feelings, and behaviors to help avoid undesired reactions.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diazepam

Diazepam , first marketed as Valium , is a medicine of the benzodiazepine family that acts as an anxiolytic . [9] It is commonly used to treat a range of conditions, including anxiety , seizures , alcohol withdrawal syndrome , benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome , muscle spasms , insomnia , and restless legs syndrome . [9] It may also be used to cause memory loss during certain medical procedures. [10] [11] It can be taken by mouth , inserted into the rectum , injected into muscle , injected into a vein or used as a nasal spray . [5] [11] When given into a vein, effects begin in one to five minutes and last up to an hour. [11] By mouth, effects begin after 15 to 60 minutes. [12]
Common side effects include sleepiness and trouble with coordination. [7] [11] Serious side effects are rare. [9] They include suicide , decreased breathing, and an increased risk of seizures if used too frequently in those with epilepsy . [9] [11] [13] Occasionally, excitement or agitation may occur. [14] [15] Long term use can result in tolerance , dependence , and withdrawal symptoms on dose reduction. [9] Abrupt stopping after long-term use can be potentially dangerous. [9] After stopping, cognitive problems may persist for six months or longer. [14] It is not recommended during pregnancy or breastfeeding. [11] Its mechanism of action is by increasing the effect of the neurotransmitter gamma -aminobutyric acid (GABA). [14]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diclofenac

Diclofenac , sold under the brand name Voltaren among others, is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to treat pain and inflammatory diseases such as gout . [5] It is taken by mouth, rectally in a suppository, used by injection, or applied to the skin. [5] [7] Improvements in pain last for as much as eight hours. [5] It is also available in combination with misoprostol in an effort to decrease stomach problems. [8]
Common side effects include abdominal pain , gastrointestinal bleeding , nausea, dizziness, headache, and swelling. [5] Serious side effects may include heart disease , stroke , kidney problems , and stomach ulceration . [8] [5] Use is not recommended in the third trimester of pregnancy . [5] It is likely safe during breastfeeding . [8] It is believed to work by decreasing the production of prostaglandin . [9] It blocks both cycloxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cycloxygenase-2 (COX-2). [5]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietitian
A dietitian , medical dietitian , or dietician [1] is an expert in identifying and treating disease-related malnutrition and in conducting medical nutrition therapy , for example designing an enteral tube feeding regimen or mitigating the effects of cancer cachexia . Many dietitians work in hospitals and usually see specific patients where a nutritional assessment and intervention has been requested by a doctor or nurse, for example if a patient has lost their ability to swallow or requires artificial nutrition due to intestinal failure. Dietitians are the only regulated healthcare professionals licensed to assess, diagnose, and treat such problems. In the United Kingdom, dietitian is a 'protected title', meaning identifying yourself as a dietitian without appropriate education and registration is prohibited by law. [2] [3] [4]
A registered dietitian (RD) (UK/USA) or registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN) (USA) [5] [6] [7] meets all of a set of special academic and professional requirements, including the completion of a bachelor's and/or master's degree in nutrition and dietetics (or equivalent). 1 or more internships (USA) or clinical placements (UK) must also be completed. These may be allocated and monitored by the university as part of the structured degree programme (UK) or may be applied for separately (USA).
Roughly half of all RD(N)s hold graduate degrees [8] and many have certifications in specialized fields such as nutrition support, sports, paediatrics, renal, oncological, food-allergy, or gerontological nutrition. Although assessment priorities differ depending on the specialist area, a patient's medical and surgical history, biochemistry, diet history, eating and exercise habits usually form the basis of assessment. The RD(N) negotiates a treatment plan with the patient which may include prescriptions, and follow-up visits often focus on maintenance and monitoring progress.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilation_and_curettage
Dilation (or dilatation ) and curettage ( D&C ) refers to the dilation (widening/opening) of the cervix and surgical removal of part of the lining of the uterus and/or contents of the uterus by scraping and scooping ( curettage ). It is a gynecologic procedure used for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, and is the most commonly used method for first trimester miscarriage or abortion . [1] [2] [3] [4]
D&C normally refers to a procedure involving a curette , also called sharp curettage . [2] However, some sources use the term D&C to refer to any procedure that involves the processes of dilation and removal of uterine contents, which includes the more common suction curettage procedures of manual and electric vacuum aspiration . [5]
D&Cs may be performed in pregnant and non-pregnant patients, for different clinical indications.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability

A disability is any medical condition that makes it more difficult for a person to do certain activities or effectively interact with the world around them (socially or materially). These conditions, or impairments, may be cognitive , developmental , intellectual , mental , physical , sensory , or a combination of multiple factors. Impairments causing disability may be present from birth or occur during a person's lifetime. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities defines disability as:
long-term physical, mental, intellectual or sensory impairments which in interaction with various barriers may hinder [a person's] full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others. [1]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diseases_Database
The Diseases Database is a free website that provides information about the relationships between medical conditions, symptoms , and medications . The database is run by Medical Object Oriented Software Enterprises Ltd, a company based in London. [1]
The site's stated aim is "education, background reading and general interest" with an intended audience "physicians, other clinical healthcare workers and students of these professions". The editor of the site is stated as Malcolm H Duncan, a UK qualified medical doctor. [2]
The Diseases Database is based on a collection of about 8,500 concepts, called "items", related to human medicine including diseases, drugs, symptoms, physical signs and abnormal laboratory results. [3]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distress_(medicine)
In medicine, distress is an aversive state in which a person is unable to completely adapt to stressors and their resulting stress and shows maladaptive behaviors. [1] It can be evident in the presence of various phenomena, such as inappropriate social interaction (e.g., aggression, passivity, or withdrawal).
Distress is the opposite of eustress , a positive stress that motivates people.
Stress can be created by influences such as work , school, peers or co-workers, family and death. Other influences vary by age.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diuretic
A diuretic ( / ˌ d aɪ j ʊ ˈ r ɛ t ɪ k / ) is any substance that promotes diuresis , the increased production of urine . This includes forced diuresis . There are several categories of diuretics. All diuretics increase the excretion of water from bodies, although each class does so in a distinct way. Alternatively, an antidiuretic , such as vasopressin ( antidiuretic hormone ), is an agent or drug which reduces the excretion of water in urine.
In medicine , diuretics are used to treat heart failure , liver cirrhosis , hypertension , influenza , water poisoning , and certain kidney diseases . Some diuretics, such as acetazolamide , help to make the urine more alkaline and are helpful in increasing excretion of substances such as aspirin in cases of overdose or poisoning. Diuretics are sometimes abused by people with an eating disorder , especially people with bulimia nervosa , with the goal of losing weight.
The antihypertensive actions of some diuretics ( thiazides and loop diuretics in particular) are independent of their diuretic effect. [1] [2] That is, the reduction in blood pressure is not due to decreased blood volume resulting from increased urine production , but occurs through other mechanisms and at lower doses than that required to produce diuresis . Indapamide was specifically designed with this in mind, and has a larger therapeutic window for hypertension (without pronounced diuresis) than most other diuretics.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctors_Without_Borders

Médecins Sans Frontières ( MSF ; pronounced [medsɛ̃ sɑ̃ fʁɔ̃tjɛʁ] ( listen ) ), sometimes rendered in English as Doctors Without Borders , is an international humanitarian medical non-governmental organisation (NGO) of French origin best known for its projects in conflict zones and in countries affected by endemic diseases . In 2019, the group was active in 70 countries with over 35,000 personnel mostly local doctors, nurses and other medical professionals, logistical experts, water and sanitation engineers and administrators. [2] Private donors provide about 90% of the organisation's funding, while corporate donations provide the rest, giving MSF an annual budget of approximately US$1.63 billion. [3]
Médecins Sans Frontières was founded in 1971, in the aftermath of the Biafra secession , by a small group of French doctors and journalists who sought to expand accessibility to medical care across national boundaries and irrespective of race , religion , creed or political affiliation. [4] To that end, the organisation emphasises "independence and impartiality", and explicitly precludes political, economic, or religious factors in its decision making. For these reasons, it limits the amount of funding received from governments or intergovernmental organisations. These principles have allowed MSF to speak freely with respect to acts of war, corruption, or other hindrances to medical care or human well-being. Only once in its history, during the 1994 genocide in Rwanda , has the organisation called for military intervention.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doping_in_sport

In competitive sports, doping is the use of banned athletic performance-enhancing drugs by athletic competitors.  The term doping is widely used by organizations that regulate sporting competitions. The use of drugs to enhance performance is considered unethical, and therefore prohibited, by most international sports organizations, including the International Olympic Committee . Furthermore, athletes (or athletic programs) taking explicit measures to evade detection exacerbate the ethical violation with overt deception and cheating .
The origins of doping in sports go back to the very creation of sport itself. From ancient usage of substances in chariot racing to more recent controversies in baseball and cycling , popular views among athletes have varied widely from country to country over the years. The general trend among authorities and sporting organizations over the past several decades has been to strictly regulate the use of drugs in sport. The reasons for the ban are mainly the health risks of performance-enhancing drugs, the equality of opportunity for athletes, and the exemplary effect of drug-free sport for the public. Anti-doping authorities state that using performance-enhancing drugs goes against the "spirit of sport".
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorland%27s_Medical_Dictionary
Dorland's is the brand name of a family of medical reference works (including dictionaries , spellers and word books, and spell-check software ) in various media spanning printed books, CD-ROMs, and online content. The flagship products are Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary (currently in its 32nd edition) and Dorland's Pocket Medical Dictionary (currently in its 29th edition). The principal dictionary was first published in 1890 as the American Illustrated Medical Dictionary , including 770 pages. The pocket edition, called the American Pocket Medical Dictionary , was first published in 1898, consisting of just over 500 pages.
With the death of the editor William Alexander Newman Dorland , AM, MD in 1956, the dictionaries were retitled to incorporate his name, which was how they had generally come to be known.  The illustrated dictionary had grown to 2208 pages for the 31st edition.
The dictionaries were historically published by Saunders .
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_withdrawal
Drug withdrawal , drug withdrawal syndrome , or substance withdrawal syndrome , [1] is the group of symptoms that occur upon the abrupt discontinuation or decrease in the intake of medicational or recreational drugs .
In order for the symptoms of withdrawal to occur, one must have first developed a form of drug dependence . This may occur as physical dependence , psychological dependence or both. Drug dependence develops from consuming one or more substances over a period of time.
Dependence arises in a dose-dependent manner and produces withdrawal symptoms that vary with the type of drug that is consumed. For example, prolonged use of an antidepressant medication is likely to cause a much different reaction when discontinued compared to discontinuation of an opioid , such as heroin . Withdrawal symptoms from opiates include anxiety, sweating, vomiting, and diarrhea. Alcohol withdrawal symptoms include irritability, fatigue, shaking, sweating, and nausea. Withdrawal from nicotine can cause irritability, fatigue, insomnia, headache, and difficulty concentrating. Many prescription and legal nonprescription substances can also cause withdrawal symptoms when individuals stop consuming them, even if they were taken as directed by a physician.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchenne_muscular_dystrophy
Duchenne muscular dystrophy ( DMD ) is a severe type of muscular dystrophy that primarily affects boys. [3] Muscle weakness usually begins around the age of four, and worsens quickly. [2] Muscle loss typically occurs first in the thighs and pelvis followed by the arms. [3] This can result in trouble standing up. [3] Most are unable to walk by the age of 12. [2] Affected muscles may look larger due to increased fat content. [3] Scoliosis is also common. [3] Some may have intellectual disability . [3] Females with a single copy of the defective gene may show mild symptoms. [3]
The disorder is X-linked recessive . [3] About two thirds of cases are inherited from a person's mother, while one third of cases are due to a new mutation . [3] It is caused by a mutation in the gene for the protein dystrophin . [3] Dystrophin is important to maintain the muscle fiber's cell membrane . [3] Genetic testing can often make the diagnosis at birth. [3] Those affected also have a high level of creatine kinase in their blood . [3]
Although there is no known cure, physical therapy , braces , and corrective surgery may help with some symptoms. [2] Assisted ventilation may be required in those with weakness of breathing muscles . [3] Medications used include steroids to slow muscle degeneration, anticonvulsants to control seizures and some muscle activity, and immunosuppressants to delay damage to dying muscle cells . [2] Gene therapy , as a treatment, is in the early stages of study in humans. [3] A small initial study using gene therapy has given some children improved muscle strength, but long term effects are unknown as of 2020. [6]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysautonomia
Dysautonomia or autonomic dysfunction is a condition in which the autonomic nervous system (ANS) does not work properly. This may affect the functioning of the heart , bladder , intestines , sweat glands , pupils , and blood vessels. Dysautonomia has many causes, not all of which may be classified as neuropathic . [5] A number of conditions can feature dysautonomia, such as Parkinson's disease , multiple system atrophy , and dementia with Lewy bodies , [6] Ehlers-Danlos syndromes , [7] autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy and autonomic neuropathy , [8] HIV/AIDS , [9] autonomic failure , and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome .
The diagnosis is achieved through functional testing of the ANS, focusing on the affected organ system . Investigations may be performed to identify underlying disease processes that may have led to the development of symptoms or autonomic neuropathy. Symptomatic treatment is available for many symptoms associated with dysautonomia, and some disease processes can be directly treated. [10]
The symptoms of dysautonomia, which are numerous and vary widely for each individual, are due to inefficient or unbalanced efferent signals sent via both systems. [ medical citation needed ] The primary symptoms in individuals with dysautonomia include
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dystonia

Dystonia is a neurological hyperkinetic movement disorder syndrome in which sustained or repetitive muscle contractions result in twisting and repetitive movements or abnormal fixed postures. [3] The movements may resemble a tremor . Dystonia is often intensified or exacerbated by physical activity, and symptoms may progress into adjacent muscles. [4]
The disorder may be hereditary or caused by other factors such as birth-related or other physical trauma , infection , poisoning (e.g., lead poisoning ) or reaction to pharmaceutical drugs , particularly neuroleptics , [3] or stress. Treatment must be highly customized to the needs of the individual and may include oral medications, chemodenervation botulinum neurotoxin injections, physical therapy, or other supportive therapies, and surgical procedures such as deep brain stimulation .
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroconvulsive_therapy
Electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT ) is a psychiatric treatment where a generalized seizure (without muscular convulsions ) is electrically induced to manage refractory mental disorders . [1] Typically, 70 to 120 volts are applied externally to the patient's head resulting in approximately 800 milliamperes of direct current passed through the brain, for 100 milliseconds to 6 seconds duration, either from temple to temple (bilateral ECT) or from front to back of one side of the head (unilateral ECT).
The ECT procedure was first conducted in 1938 by Italian psychiatrist Ugo Cerletti [2] and rapidly replaced less safe and effective forms of biological treatments in use at the time. ECT is often used with informed consent [3] as a safe and effective intervention for major depressive disorder , mania , and catatonia . [4] ECT machines were originally placed in the Class III category by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1976. [5] They were re-classified as Class II devices, for treatment of catatonia, major depressive disorder, and bipolar disorder , in 2018. [6]
Aside from effects on the brain, the general physical risks of ECT are similar to those of brief general anesthesia . [7] : 259 Immediately following treatment, the most common adverse effects are confusion and transient memory loss. [4] [8] Among treatments for severely depressed pregnant women, ECT is one of the least harmful to the fetus . [9]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrology
Electrology is the practice of electrical hair removal to permanently remove human hair from the body. Electrolysis is the actual process of removing hair using electricity.
In electrolysis, a qualified professional called an electrologist slides a hair-thin, solid metal probe into each hair follicle without puncturing the skin (when inserted properly). Electricity is delivered to the follicle through the probe, which causes localized damage to the areas that generate hairs, either through the formation of caustic sodium hydroxide (the galvanic method), overheating (thermolysis), or both (the blend method).
All three methods (galvanic, thermolysis, and blend) have their own merits, and one method is not better than another. The success depends on the skill of the electrologist, the type of hair being removed, the condition of the skin and the pain threshold of the client. All three methods, when properly performed, can be thorough at destroying the hair matrix cells, and leaving follicles incapable of regrowing hair.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eli_Lilly_and_Company

Eli Lilly and Company is an American pharmaceutical company headquartered in Indianapolis, Indiana , with offices in 18 countries. Its products are sold in approximately 125 countries. The company was founded in 1876 by, and named after, Col. Eli Lilly , a pharmaceutical chemist and veteran of the American Civil War . [4]
Lilly's notable achievements include being the first company to mass-produce the polio vaccine developed by Jonas Salk , and insulin . It was one of the first pharmaceutical companies to produce human insulin using recombinant DNA including Humulin ( insulin medication ), Humalog ( insulin lispro ), and the first approved biosimilar insulin product in the US, Basaglar ( insulin glargine ). [5]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabethan_collar
An Elizabethan collar , E-collar , Buster collar or pet cone (sometimes humorously called a pet lamp-shade , pet radar dish , dog-saver , or cone of shame ) is a protective medical device worn by an animal, usually a cat or dog. Shaped like a truncated cone, its purpose is to prevent the animal from biting or licking at its body or scratching at its head or neck while wounds or injuries heal . [1] The collars are named from the ruffs worn in Elizabethan times .  A U.S. patent was filed by Frank L. Johnson in 1959. [2]
The device is generally attached to the pet's usual collar with strings or tabs passed through holes punched in the sides of the plastic. The neck of the collar should be short enough to let the animal eat and drink. Although most pets adjust to them quite well, others will not eat or drink with the collar in place and the collar is temporarily removed for meals. [3]
While purpose-made collars can be purchased from veterinarians or pet stores, they can also be made from plastic and cardboard or by using plastic flowerpots, wastebaskets, buckets or lampshades. Modern collars might involve soft fabric trim along the edges to increase comfort and velcro surfaces for ease of attachment and removal.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department

An emergency department ( ED ), also known as an accident & emergency department ( A&E ), emergency room ( ER ), emergency ward ( EW ) or casualty department , is a medical treatment facility specializing in emergency medicine , the acute care of patients who present without prior appointment; either by their own means or by that of an ambulance . The emergency department is usually found in a hospital or other primary care center.
Due to the unplanned nature of patient attendance, the department must provide initial treatment for a broad spectrum of illnesses and injuries, some of which may be life-threatening and require immediate attention. In some countries, emergency departments have become important entry points for those without other means of access to medical care.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_medical_dispatcher
An emergency medical dispatcher is a professional telecommunicator , tasked with the gathering of information related to medical emergencies, the provision of assistance and instructions by voice, prior to the arrival of emergency medical services (EMS), and the dispatching and support of EMS resources responding to an emergency call. The term "emergency medical dispatcher" is also a certification level and a professional designation, certified through the Association of Public-Safety Communications Officials-International (APSCOI) [1] and the International Academies of Emergency Dispatch. [2] Many dispatchers, whether certified or not, will dispatch using a standard emergency medical dispatch protocol.
Dispatchers have always played an essential role of emergency medical services (EMS). At its most basic, the role of the dispatcher has been to identify the problem and the location of the patient, and then identify an ambulance that can be sent to the location. Prior to the professionalization of emergency medical services, this step in the process was often informal; the caller would simply call the local ambulance service, the telephone call would be answered (in many cases by the ambulance attendant who would be responding to the call), the location and problem information would be gathered, and an ambulance assigned to complete the task. The ambulance would then complete the call, return to the station, and wait for the next telephone call.
Although earlier experiments with the use of radio communication in ambulances did occur, it was not until the 1950s that the use of radio dispatch became widespread in the United States and Canada. Indeed, during the 1950s the presence of radio dispatch was often treated as marketing inducement, and was prominently displayed on the sides of ambulances, along with other technological advances, such as carrying oxygen . Dispatch methodology was often determined by the business arrangements of the ambulance company. If the ambulance were under contract to the town, it might be dispatched as an 'add-on' to the fire department or police department resources. In some cases, it might be under contract to the local hospital, and dispatched from there. In many cases, small independent ambulance companies were simply dispatched by a family member or employee, employed part-time in many cases. Ambulance dispatchers required little in the way of qualifications, apart from good telephone manners and a knowledge of the local geography.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_medical_technician
An emergency medical technician ( EMT ), also known as an ambulance technician , is a health professional that provides emergency medical services . [1] [2] EMTs are most commonly found working in ambulances . In English-speaking countries, paramedics are a separate profession that has additional educational requirements, qualifications, and scope of practice. [3] [4]
EMTs are often employed by private ambulance services, municipal EMS agencies, governments , hospitals , and fire departments . Some EMTs are paid employees, while others (particularly those in rural areas ) are volunteers . [2] EMTs provide medical care under a set of protocols, which are typically written by a physician . [5] [6]
EMTs are exposed to a variety of hazards such as lifting patients and equipment, treating those with infectious disease, handling hazardous substances, and transportation via ground or air vehicles. Employers can prevent occupational illness or injury by providing safe patient handling equipment, implementing a training program to educate EMTs on job hazards, and supplying PPE such as respirators, gloves, and isolation gowns when dealing with biological hazards. [7]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic
An epidemic (from Greek ἐπί epi "upon or above" and δῆμος demos "people") is the rapid spread of disease to a large number of people in a given population within a short period of time. For example, in meningococcal infections , an attack rate in excess of 15 cases per 100,000 people for two consecutive weeks is considered an epidemic. [1] [2]
Epidemics of infectious disease are generally caused by several factors including a change in the ecology of the host population (e.g., increased stress or increase in the density of a vector species), a genetic change in the pathogen reservoir or the introduction of an emerging patholow that found in the endemic equilibrium and the transmission threshold is exceeded. [3]
An epidemic may be restricted to one location; however, if it spreads to other countries or continents and affects a substantial number of people, it may be termed a pandemic . [1] The declaration of an epidemic usually requires a good understanding of a baseline rate of incidence ; epidemics for certain diseases, such as influenza , are defined as reaching some defined increase in incidence above this baseline. [2] A few cases of a very rare disease may be classified as an epidemic, while many cases of a common disease (such as the common cold ) would not. An epidemic can cause enormous damage through financial and economic losses in addition to impaired health and loss of life.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eradication_of_infectious_diseases

Eradication is the reduction of an infectious disease 's prevalence in the global host population to zero. [1] It is sometimes confused with elimination, which describes either the reduction of an infectious disease's prevalence in a regional population to zero or the reduction of the global prevalence to a negligible amount. Further confusion arises from the use of the term eradication to refer to the total removal of a given pathogen from an individual (also known as clearance of an infection ), particularly in the context of HIV and certain other viruses where such cures are sought.
The selection of infectious diseases for eradication is based on rigorous criteria, as both biological and technical features determine whether a pathogenic organism is (at least potentially) eradicable. The targeted organism must not have a non-human reservoir (or, in the case of animal diseases, the infection reservoir must be an easily identifiable species, as in the case of rinderpest ), and/or amplify in the environment. This implies that sufficient information on the life cycle and transmission dynamics is available at the time an eradication initiative is programmed. An efficient and practical intervention (such as a vaccine or antibiotic) must be available to interrupt transmission of the infective agent. Studies of measles in the pre-vaccination era led to the concept of the critical community size , the size of the population below which a pathogen ceases to circulate. [2] The use of vaccination programs before the introduction of an eradication campaign can reduce the susceptible population. The disease to be eradicated should be clearly identifiable, and an accurate diagnostic tool should exist. Economic considerations, as well as societal and political support and commitment, are other crucial factors that determine eradication feasibility. [3] [4]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erotomania
Erotomania is listed in the DSM-5 as a subtype of a delusional disorder . [1] It is a relatively uncommon paranoid condition that is characterized by an individual's delusions of another person being infatuated with them. [2] This disorder is most often seen (though not exclusively) in female patients who are shy, dependent and sexually inexperienced. The object of the delusion is typically a male who is unattainable due to high social or financial status, marriage or disinterest. [2] [3] The object of obsession may also be imaginary, deceased or someone the patient has never met. Delusions of reference are common, as the erotomanic individual often perceives that they are being sent messages from the secret admirer through innocuous events such as seeing license plates from specific states, but has no research development proof. [3] Commonly, the onset of erotomania is sudden, and the course is chronic. [3]
Erotomania is more common in women, but men are more likely to exhibit violent and stalker -like behaviors. [3] The core symptom of the disorder is that the sufferer holds an unshakable belief that another person is secretly in love with them. In some cases, the sufferer may believe several people at once are "secret admirers". Most commonly, the individual has delusions of being loved by an unattainable person who is usually an acquaintance or someone the person has never met. The sufferer may also experience other types of delusions concurrently with erotomania, such as delusions of reference, wherein the perceived admirer secretly communicates their love by subtle methods such as body posture, arrangement of household objects, colors, license plates on cars from specific states, and other seemingly innocuous acts (or, if the person is a public figure, through clues in the media). Some delusions may be extreme such as the conception, birth, and kidnapping of children that never existed. The delusional objects may be replaced by others over time, and some may be chronic in fixed forms. [3] Denial is characteristic with this disorder as the patients do not accept the fact that their object of delusion may be married, unavailable, or uninterested. The phantom lover may also be imaginary or deceased.
Erotomania has two forms: primary and secondary. Primary erotomania is also commonly referred to as de Clerambault's syndrome and Old Maid's Insanity [4] and it exists alone without comorbidities , has a sudden onset and a chronic outcome. [3] The secondary form is found along with mental disorders like paranoid schizophrenia, often includes persecutory delusions , hallucinations , and grandiose ideas, and has a more gradual onset. [3] Patients with a "fixed" condition are more seriously ill with constant delusions and are less responsive to treatment. These individuals are usually timid, dependent women that are often sexually inexperienced. [3] In those with a more mild, recurrent condition, delusions are shorter-lived and the disorder can exist undetected by others for years. [4] Problematic behaviors include actions like calling, sending letters and gifts, making unannounced house visits and other persistent stalking behaviors. [3]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escitalopram
Escitalopram , sold under the brand names Cipralex and Lexapro , among others, is an antidepressant of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) class. [2] Escitalopram is mainly used to treat major depressive disorder or generalized anxiety disorder . [2] It is taken by mouth. [2]
Common side effects include trouble sleeping, nausea, sexual problems , and feeling tired. [2] More serious side effects may include suicide in people under the age of 25. [2] It is unclear if use during pregnancy or breastfeeding is safe. [3] Escitalopram is the ( S )- stereoisomer (left-handed version) of citalopram (which exists as a racemate ), hence the name es citalopram. [2] In other words, escitalopram is a chiral switch of citalopram.
Escitalopram was approved for medical use in the United States in 2002. [2] Escitalopram is sometimes replaced by twice the dose of citalopram. [4] In 2018, it was the 22nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States with more than 25 million prescriptions. [5] [6]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excessive_Daytime_Sleepiness
Excessive daytime sleepiness is characterized by persistent sleepiness and often a general lack of energy, even during the day after apparently adequate or even prolonged nighttime sleep. EDS can be considered as a broad condition encompassing several sleep disorders where increased sleep is a symptom, or as a symptom of another underlying disorder like narcolepsy , circadian rhythm sleep disorder , sleep apnea or idiopathic hypersomnia .
Some persons with EDS, including those with hypersomnias like narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia , are compelled to nap repeatedly during the day; fighting off increasingly strong urges to sleep during inappropriate times such as while driving, while at work, during a meal, or in conversations. As the compulsion to sleep intensifies, the ability to complete tasks sharply diminishes, often mimicking the appearance of intoxication. During occasional unique and/or stimulating circumstances, a person with EDS can sometimes remain animated, awake and alert, for brief or extended periods of time.  EDS can affect the ability to function in family, social, occupational, or other settings. A proper diagnosis of the underlying cause and ultimately treatment of symptoms and/or the underlying cause can help mitigate such complications. [1]
EDS can be a symptom of a number of factors and disorders. Specialists in sleep medicine are trained to diagnose them. Some are:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extrapyramidal_symptom
Extrapyramidal symptoms ( EPS ), also known as extrapyramidal side effects ( EPSE ) are drug-induced movement disorders, which include acute and long-term symptoms. These symptoms include dystonia (continuous spasms and muscle contractions), akathisia (may manifest as motor restlessness), [1] parkinsonism characteristic symptoms such as rigidity , bradykinesia (slowness of movement), tremor , and tardive dyskinesia (irregular, jerky movements). [2] Extrapyramidal symptoms are a reason why subjects drop out of clinical trials of antipsychotics; of the 213 (14.6%) subjects that dropped out of one of the largest clinical trials of antipsychotics (the CATIE trial (Clinical Antipsychotic Trials for Intervention Effectiveness), which included 1460 randomized subjects), 58 (27.2%) of those discontinuations were due to EPS. [3]
Extrapyramidal symptoms are most commonly caused by typical antipsychotic drugs that antagonize dopamine D2 receptors. [2] The most common typical antipsychotics associated with EPS are haloperidol and fluphenazine . [4] Atypical antipsychotics have lower D2 receptor affinity or higher serotonin 5-HT2A receptor affinity which lead to lower rates of EPS. [5]
Other anti-dopaminergic drugs, like the antiemetic metoclopramide , can also result in extrapyramidal side effects. [6] Short and long-term use of antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI), and norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitors (NDRI) have also resulted in EPS. [7] Specifically, duloxetine , sertraline , escitalopram , fluoxetine , and bupropion have been linked to the induction of EPS. [7]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_drop
Eye drops or eyedrops are saline -containing drops used as an ocular route to administer . Depending on the condition being treated, they may contain steroids , antihistamines , sympathomimetics , beta receptor blockers , parasympathomimetics , parasympatholytics , prostaglandins , nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antibiotics , antifungals , or topical anesthetics . Eye drops sometimes do not have medications in them and are only lubricating and tear -replacing solutions.
Eye drops have less of a risk of side effects than do oral medicines, and such risk can be minimized by occluding the lacrimal punctum (i.e. pressing on the inner corner of the eye) for a short while after instilling drops. Eye drops are also used for stopping itching and redness of the eyes.
Prior to the development of single-use pre-loaded sterile plastic applicators, eye drops were administered using an eye dropper , a glass pipette with a rubber bulb.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_Movement_Desensitization_and_Reprocessing
Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing ( EMDR ) is a form of psychotherapy developed by Francine Shapiro starting in 1988 in which the person being treated is asked to recall distressing images; the therapist then directs the patient in one type of bilateral stimulation, such as side-to-side eye rapid movement  or hand tapping. [1] According to the 2013 World Health Organization practice guideline: "This therapy [EMDR] is based on the idea that negative thoughts, feelings and behaviours are the result of unprocessed memories. The treatment involves standardized procedures that include focusing simultaneously on (a) spontaneous associations of traumatic images, thoughts, emotions and bodily sensations and (b) bilateral stimulation that is most commonly in the form of repeated eye movements." [2]
EMDR is included in several evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), with varying levels of recommendation and evidence (very low to moderate per WHO stress guidelines). [3] [2] [4] As of 2020, the American Psychological Association lists EMDR as an evidence-based treatment for PTSD [5] but stresses that "the available evidence can be interpreted in several ways" and notes there is debate about the precise mechanism by which EMDR appears to relieve PTSD symptoms with some evidence EMDR may simply be a variety of exposure therapy . [6]
EMDR therapy was first developed by Francine Shapiro upon noticing that certain eye movements reduced the intensity of a disturbing thought. She then conducted a scientific study with trauma victims in 1988 and the research was published in the Journal of Traumatic Stress in 1989. [7] Her hypothesis was that when a traumatic or distressing experience occurs, it may overwhelm normal coping mechanisms , with the memory and associated stimuli being inadequately processed and stored in an isolated memory network.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_history_(medicine)
In medicine , a family history ( FH or FHx ) consists of information about disorders from which the direct blood relatives of the patient have suffered. [1] Genealogy typically includes very little of the medical history of the family , but the medical history could be considered a specific subset of the total history of a family. [ citation needed ] Accurate knowledge of a patient's family history may identify a predisposition to developing certain illnesses, which can inform clinical decisions and allow effective management or even prevention of conditions. [2] [3]
Early mentions of family medical histories in medical literature date from the 1840s. Henry Ancell mentioned inquiring about the family history of a patient in a medical case study in 1842, noting that the patient's presenting concern appears to be present in relatives and remarking on the prolific reproduction of her female relatives. [4] In 1849, W.H. Walshe argued in a lecture at University College Hospital that in addition to a history of the presenting disease itself, a physician should also collect family history. [5] Walshe's lecture does not define or justify the family history, which may suggest that taking one was already in common practice. However, later 19th-century physicians did provide a specific apologia for family histories and in some cases explicitly noted that they were not yet being taken routinely.
James Begbie argued that understanding the health of the entire family, including cousins, can help predict otherwise unpredictable illnesses that run in the family. [6] Begbie's use of the family history for both predictive and normative evaluation of the family anticipated Francis Galton , who championed the routine family history as a eugenic strategy in his 1883 text, Inquiries into Human Faculty and Its Development . Galton writes:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_liver_disease
Fatty liver disease ( FLD ), also known as hepatic steatosis , is a condition where excess fat builds up in the liver . [1] Often there are no or few symptoms. [1] [2] Occasionally there may be tiredness or pain in the upper right side of the abdomen . [1] Complications may include cirrhosis , liver cancer , and esophageal varices . [1] [3]
There are two types of fatty liver disease: non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and alcoholic liver disease . [1] NAFLD is made up of simple fatty liver and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). [5] [1] The primary risks include alcohol , type 2 diabetes , and obesity . [1] [3] Other risk factors include certain medications such as glucocorticoids , and hepatitis C . [1] It is unclear why some people with NAFLD develop simple fatty liver and others develop NASH. [1] Diagnosis is based on the medical history supported by blood tests, medical imaging , and occasionally liver biopsy . [1]
It is recommended that people with fatty liver disease do not drink alcohol. [3] [2] Treatment of NAFLD is generally otherwise by dietary changes and exercise to bring about weight loss . [1] In those who are severely affected, liver transplantation may be an option. [1] More than 90% of all heavy drinkers develop fatty liver while about 25% develop the more severe alcoholic hepatitis . [4] NAFLD affects about 30% of people in Western countries and 10% of people in Asia. [2] NAFLD affects about 10% of children in the United States. [1] It occurs more often in older people and males. [3] [5]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female_genital_mutilation


Female genital mutilation ( FGM ), also known as female genital cutting and female circumcision , [a] is the ritual cutting or removal of some or all of the external female genitalia . The practice is found in Africa, Asia and the Middle East, and within communities from countries in which FGM is common. UNICEF estimated in 2016 that 200 million women living today in 30 countries—27 African countries, Indonesia, Iraqi Kurdistan and Yemen—have undergone the procedures. [3]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetal_viability
Fetal viability or foetal viability is the ability of a fetus to survive outside the uterus . [1]
Viability , as the word has been used in United States constitutional law since Roe v. Wade , is the potential of the fetus to survive outside the uterus after birth, natural or induced, when supported by up-to-date medicine. Fetal viability depends largely on the fetal organ maturity, and environmental conditions. [2] According to Websters Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary of the English Language, viability of a fetus means having reached such a stage of development as to be capable of living, under normal conditions, outside the uterus. Viability exists as a function of biomedical and technological capacities, which are different in different parts of the world. As a consequence, there is, at the present time, no worldwide, uniform gestational age that defines viability. [3]
According to the McGraw-Hill medical dictionary a nonviable fetus is "an expelled or delivered fetus which, although living, cannot possibly survive to the point of sustaining life independently, even with support of the best available medical therapy." [4] A legal definition states: "Nonviable means not capable of living, growing, or developing and functioning successfully. It is antithesis of viable, which is defined as having attained such form and development of organs as to be normally capable of living outside the uterus." [Wolfe v. Isbell, 291 Ala. 327, 329 (Ala. 1973)] [5]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetoscopy
Fetoscopy is an endoscopic procedure during pregnancy to allow surgical access to the fetus , the amniotic cavity , the umbilical cord , and the fetal side of the placenta . A small (3–4 mm) incision is made in the abdomen , and an endoscope is inserted through the abdominal wall and uterus into the amniotic cavity. Fetoscopy allows for medical interventions such as a biopsy (tissue sample) or a laser occlusion of abnormal blood vessels (such as chorioangioma ) or the treatment of spina bifida . [1]
Fetoscopy is usually performed in the second or third trimester of pregnancy. The procedure can place the fetus at increased risk of adverse outcomes, including fetal loss or preterm delivery, so the risks and benefits must be carefully weighed in order to protect the health of the mother and fetus(es). The procedure is typically performed in an operating room by an obstetrician-gynecologist .
In 1945, Björn Westin published a study which documented his use of a panendoscope to directly observe embryos. [2] In 1966, Agüero et al published a study which used hysteroscopy to observe various features of the fetus, cervix, and uterus. [2] In 1972, Carlo Valenti of the SUNY Downstate Medical Center recorded a technique which he called "endoamnioscopy", which allowed for direct visualization of the developing fetus. [3] Gallinat made the first attempt to standardize these techniques in 1978. [2]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_aid_kit
A first aid kit is a collection of supplies and equipment that is used to give medical treatment. There is a wide variation in the contents of first aid kits based on the knowledge and experience of those putting it together, the differing first aid requirements of the area where it may be used and variations in legislation or regulation in a given area.
The international standard for first aid kits is that they should be identified with the ISO graphical symbol for first aid (from ISO 7010 ) which is an equal white cross on a green background. [1]
First aid kits can be assembled in almost any type of container, and this will depend on whether they are commercially produced or assembled by an individual.  Standard kits often come in durable plastic boxes, fabric pouches or in wall mounted cabinets.  The type of container will vary depending on the purpose, and they range in size from wallet-sized through to a large box.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_feet
Flat feet (also called pes planus or fallen arches ) is a postural deformity in which the arches of the foot collapse, with the entire sole of the foot coming into complete or near-complete contact with the ground.
There is a functional relationship between the structure of the arch of the foot and the biomechanics of the lower leg. The arch provides an elastic, springy connection between the forefoot and the hind foot so that a majority of the forces incurred during weight bearing on the foot can be dissipated before the force reaches the long bones of the leg and thigh. [1]
In pes planus, the head of the talus bone is displaced medially and distal from the navicular bone . As a result, the Plantar calcaneonavicular ligament (spring ligament) and the tendon of the tibialis posterior muscle are stretched to the extent that the individual with pes planus loses the function of the medial longitudinal arch (MLA). If the MLA is absent or nonfunctional in both the seated and standing positions, the individual has “rigid” flatfoot. If the MLA is present and functional while the individual is sitting or standing up on their toes, but this arch disappears when assuming a foot-flat stance, the individual has “supple” flatfoot. This latter condition is often treated with arch supports. [1] However, a recent randomized controlled trial found no evidence for the efficacy of treatment of flat feet in children either from expensive prescribed orthotics (i.e., shoe inserts) or less expensive over-the-counter orthotics. [2] Three studies (see citations below in Military performance section ) of military recruits have shown no evidence of increased injury, or foot problems, due to flat feet, in a population of people who reach military service age without prior foot problems. However, these studies cannot be used to judge possible future damage from this condition when diagnosed at younger ages. They also cannot be applied to persons whose flat feet are associated with foot symptoms, or certain symptoms in other parts of the body (such as the leg or back) possibly referable to the foot.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluoxetine

Fluoxetine , sold under the brand names Prozac and Sarafem among others, is an antidepressant of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) class. [2] It is used for the treatment of major depressive disorder , obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), bulimia nervosa , panic disorder , and premenstrual dysphoric disorder . [2] It is also approved for treatment of major depressive disorder in adolescents and children 8 years of age and over. [6] It has also been used to treat premature ejaculation . [2] Fluoxetine is taken by mouth . [2]
Common side effects include indigestion, trouble sleeping, sexual dysfunction, loss of appetite, dry mouth, and  rash. Serious side effects include serotonin syndrome , mania , seizures , an increased risk of suicidal behavior in people under 25 years old, and an increased risk of bleeding. [2] Discontinuation syndrome is less likely to occur with fluoxetine than with other antidepressants, but it still happens in many cases. Fluoxetine taken during pregnancy is associated with significant increase in congenital heart defects in the newborns. [7] [8] It has been suggested that fluoxetine therapy may be continued during breastfeeding if it was used during pregnancy or if other antidepressants were ineffective. [9] Its mechanism of action is unknown, but some hypothesize that it is related to serotonin activity in the brain.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foch_Hospital
Foch Hospital ( French : Hôpital Foch ) is a celebrated teaching hospital in the Suresnes , France . Part of the Établissement de santé privé d'intérêt collectif and a teaching hospital of Versailles Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines University , [1] it is one of Europe's largest hospitals.
It was established in 1929 with the help of Consuelo Vanderbilt [2] and Winnaretta Singer . It was named in honour of Ferdinand Foch .
Through its history, the Foch Hospital hosted notable doctors, among others:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontotemporal_dementia
Frontotemporal dementia ( FTD ), or frontotemporal degeneration disease , [1] or frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder , [2] encompasses several types of dementia involving the frontal and temporal lobes . [3] FTDs are broadly presented as behavioral or language disorders. [4] The three main subtypes or variant syndromes are a behavioral variant (bvFTD) previously known as Pick's disease , [5] [6] and two variants of primary progressive aphasia – semantic variant (svPPA), and nonfluent variant (nfvPPA). [4] [6] Two rare distinct subtypes of FTD are neuronal intermediate filament inclusion disease (NIFID), and basophilic inclusion body disease.  Other related disorders include corticobasal syndrome and FTD  with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) FTD-ALS also called FTD- MND . [7]
Frontotemporal dementias are mostly early-onset syndromes that are linked to frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), [8] which is characterized by progressive neuronal loss predominantly involving the frontal or temporal lobes , and a typical loss of over 70% of spindle neurons , while other neuron types remain intact. [9]
FTD was first described by Arnold Pick in 1892 and was originally called Pick's disease , a term now reserved only for behavioral variant FTD which shows the presence of Pick bodies and Pick cells. [10] [5] [11] Second only to Alzheimer's disease (AD) in prevalence , FTD accounts for 20% of early-onset dementia cases. [7] Signs and symptoms typically manifest in late adulthood, more commonly between the ages of 45 and 65, approximately equally affecting men and women. [12]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugue_state
Dissociative fugue , formerly fugue state or psychogenic fugue , is a dissociative disorder [1] and a rare psychiatric disorder characterized by reversible amnesia for personal identity, including the memories , personality , and other identifying characteristics of individuality . The state can last days, months or longer. Dissociative fugue usually involves unplanned travel or wandering and is sometimes accompanied by the establishment of a new identity. It is a facet of dissociative amnesia , according to the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( DSM-5 ).
After recovery from a fugue state, previous memories usually return intact, and further treatment is unnecessary. Additionally, an episode of fugue is not characterized as attributable to a psychiatric disorder if it can be related to the ingestion of psychotropic substances, to physical trauma, to a general medical condition, or to dissociative identity disorder , [ clarification needed ] delirium , or dementia . [2] Fugues are precipitated by a series of long-term traumatic episodes. It is most commonly associated with childhood victims of sexual abuse who learn over time to dissociate memory of the abuse (dissociative amnesia).
Symptoms of a dissociative fugue include mild confusion and once the fugue ends, possible depression , grief, shame, and discomfort. People have also experienced a post-fugue anger . [3] Another symptom of the fugue state can consist of loss of one's identity. [4]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_magnetic_resonance_imaging
Functional magnetic resonance imaging or functional MRI ( fMRI ) measures brain activity by detecting changes associated with blood flow . [1] [2] This technique relies on the fact that cerebral blood flow and neuronal activation are coupled. When an area of the brain is in use, blood flow to that region also increases. [3]
The primary form of fMRI uses the blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) contrast, [4] discovered by Seiji Ogawa in 1990. This is a type of specialized brain and body scan used to map neural activity in the brain or spinal cord of humans or other animals by imaging the change in blood flow ( hemodynamic response ) related to energy use by brain cells. [4] Since the early 1990s, fMRI has come to dominate brain mapping research because it does not require people to undergo injections or surgery, to ingest substances, or to be exposed to ionizing radiation. [5] This measure is frequently corrupted by noise from various sources; hence, statistical procedures are used to extract the underlying signal.  The resulting brain activation can be graphically represented by color-coding the strength of activation across the brain or the specific region studied.  The technique can localize activity to within millimeters but, using standard techniques, no better than within a window of a few seconds. [6] Other methods of obtaining contrast are arterial spin labeling [7] and diffusion MRI . The latter procedure is similar to BOLD fMRI but provides contrast based on the magnitude of diffusion of water molecules in the brain.
In addition to detecting BOLD responses from activity due to tasks/stimuli, fMRI can measure resting state fMRI , or taskless fMRI, which shows the subjects' baseline BOLD variance.  Since about 1998 studies have shown the existence and properties of the default mode network (DMN), aka 'Resting State Network' (RSN), a functionally connected neural network of apparent 'brain states'.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganglioglioma
Ganglioglioma is a rare, slow-growing primary central nervous system (CNS) tumor which most frequently occurs in the temporal lobes of children and young adults. [2]
Gangliogliomas are generally benign WHO grade I tumors ; the presence of anaplastic changes in the glial component is considered to represent WHO grade III (anaplastic ganglioglioma). Criteria for WHO grade II have been suggested, but are not established. Malignant transformation of spinal ganglioglioma has been seen in only a select few cases.  Poor prognostic factors for adults with gangliogliomas include older age at diagnosis, male sex, and malignant histologic features.
Histologically, ganglioglioma is composed of both neoplastic glial and ganglion cells which are disorganized, variably cellular, and non-infiltrative. Occasionally, it may be challenging to differentiate ganglion cell tumors from an infiltrating glioma with entrapped neurons. The presence of neoplastic ganglion cells forming abnormal clusters , the presence of binucleation and dysmorphic neurons are helpful clues favoring ganglioglioma over glioma. The glial component of ganglioglioma includes fibrillary astrocytes with varying degrees of cellular atypia . The neoplastic neuronal components are often clustered or irregularly oriented. Fibrovascular stroma confined to the neuronal component, perivascular lymphocytic infiltrates, and small foci of calcification are common, as is immunopositivity for synaptophysin , neuron-specific enolase, and chromogranin A . Elevated Ki-67 and p53 labeling index is associated with more aggressive tumor behavior in both children and adults with gangliogliomas. The rare occurrence of malignant transformation is confined to the glial cell population, and is characterized by increased cellularity and mitotic activity , endothelial proliferation, and necrosis.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastric_bypass_surgery

Gastric bypass surgery refers to a technique in which the stomach is divided into a small upper pouch and a much larger lower "remnant" pouch and then the small intestine is rearranged to connect to both. Surgeons have developed several different ways to reconnect the intestine, thus leading to several different gastric bypass procedures (GBP). Any GBP leads to a marked reduction in the functional volume of the stomach, accompanied by an altered physiological and physical response to food.
The operation is prescribed to treat morbid obesity (defined as a body mass index greater than 40), type 2 diabetes , hypertension , sleep apnea , and other comorbid conditions. Bariatric surgery is the term encompassing all of the surgical treatments for morbid obesity, not just gastric bypasses, which make up only one class of such operations. The resulting weight loss, typically dramatic, markedly reduces comorbidities. The long-term mortality rate of gastric bypass patients has been shown to be reduced by up to 40%. [journal 1] [journal 2] As with all surgery, complications may occur.  A study from 2005 to 2006 revealed that 15% of patients experience complications as a result of gastric bypass, and 0.5% of patients died within six months of surgery due to complications.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroenterology
Gastroenterology [1] is the branch of medicine focused on the digestive system and its disorders.
Diseases affecting the gastrointestinal tract , which include the organs from mouth into anus , along the alimentary canal , are the focus of this speciality. Physicians practicing in this field are called gastroenterologists . They have usually completed about eight years of pre-medical and medical education , a year-long internship (if this is not a part of the residency), three years of an internal medicine residency, and three years in the gastroenterology fellowship . Gastroenterologists perform a number of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures including colonoscopy , esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), and liver biopsy . [2] Some gastroenterology trainees will complete a "fourth-year" (although this is often their seventh year of graduate medical education) in transplant hepatology , advanced interventional endoscopy , inflammatory bowel disease , motility , or other topics.
Advanced endoscopy, sometimes called interventional or surgical endoscopy, is a sub-specialty of gastroenterology that focuses on advanced endoscopic techniques for the treatment of pancreatic , hepatobiliary , and gastrointestinal disease . Interventional gastroenterologists typically undergo an additional year of rigorous training in advanced endoscopic techniques including endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, endoscopic ultrasound-guided diagnostic and interventional procedures, and advanced resection techniques including endoscopic mucosal resection and endoscopic submucosal dissection . Additionally, the performance of endoscopic bariatric procedures is also performed by some advanced endoscopists.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_bleeding
Gastrointestinal bleeding ( GI bleed ), also called gastrointestinal hemorrhage ( GIB ), is all forms of bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract , from the mouth to the rectum . [9] When there is significant blood loss over a short time, symptoms may include vomiting red blood , vomiting black blood , bloody stool , or black stool . [1] Small amounts of bleeding over a long time may cause iron-deficiency anemia resulting in feeling tired or heart-related chest pain . [1] Other symptoms may include abdominal pain , shortness of breath , pale skin , or passing out . [1] [9] Sometimes in those with small amounts of bleeding no symptoms may be present. [1]
Bleeding is typically divided into two main types: upper gastrointestinal bleeding and lower gastrointestinal bleeding . [2] Causes of upper GI bleeds include: peptic ulcer disease, esophageal varices due to liver cirrhosis and cancer , among others. [3] Causes of lower GI bleeds include: hemorrhoids , cancer, and inflammatory bowel disease among others. [2] Diagnosis typically begins with a medical history and physical examination , along with blood tests. [1] Small amounts of bleeding may be detected by fecal occult blood test. [1] Endoscopy of the lower and upper gastrointestinal tract may locate the area of bleeding. [1] Medical imaging may be useful in cases that are not clear. [1]
Initial treatment focuses on resuscitation which may include intravenous fluids and blood transfusions . [4] Often blood transfusions are not recommended unless the hemoglobin is less than 70 or 80 g/L. [7] [10] Treatment with proton pump inhibitors , octreotide , and antibiotics may be considered in certain cases. [5] [6] [11] If other measures are not effective, an esophageal balloon may be attempted in those with presumed esophageal varices. [2] Endoscopy of the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum or endoscopy of the large bowel are generally recommended within 24 hours and may allow treatment as well as diagnosis. [4]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_cancer
Gastrointestinal cancer refers to malignant conditions of the gastrointestinal tract (GI tract) and accessory organs of digestion , including the esophagus, stomach, biliary system, pancreas, small intestine, large intestine, rectum and anus. The symptoms relate to the organ affected and can include obstruction (leading to difficulty swallowing or defecating), abnormal bleeding or other associated problems. The diagnosis often requires endoscopy , followed by biopsy of suspicious tissue. The treatment depends on the location of the tumor, as well as the type of cancer cell and whether it has invaded other tissues or spread elsewhere. These factors also determine the prognosis.
Overall, the GI tract and the accessory organs of digestion (pancreas, liver, gall bladder) are responsible for more cancers and more deaths from cancer than any other system in the body. [1] [2] There is significant geographic variation in the rates of different gastrointestinal cancers. [1]
Esophageal cancer is the sixth-most-common cancer in the world, and its incidence is increasing. [4] Some three to five males are affected for each female. [4] An "esophageal cancer belt", in which the incidence of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is more than a hundred times that of adjacent areas, extends from northeastern China through central Asia to northern Iran. [1] Ethiopia also has a notably high incidence. [4] There are two main types of esophageal cancer—adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. Worldwide, the incidence of each type is about the same, but in developed countries like North America and Europe adenocarcinoma is the more common. [4]
