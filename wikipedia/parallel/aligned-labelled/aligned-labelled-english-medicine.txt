Medicine is the science [1] and practice [2] of caring for a patient and managing the diagnosis , prognosis , prevention , treatment or palliation of their injury or disease . Medicine encompasses a variety of health care practices evolved to maintain and restore health by the prevention and treatment of illness . Contemporary medicine applies biomedical sciences , biomedical research , genetics , and medical technology to diagnose , treat, and prevent injury and disease, typically through pharmaceuticals or surgery , but also through therapies as diverse as psychotherapy , external splints and traction , medical devices , biologics , and ionizing radiation , amongst others. [3]
Medicine has been practiced since prehistoric times , during most of which it was an art (an area of skill and knowledge) frequently having connections to the religious and philosophical beliefs of local culture. For example, a medicine man would apply herbs and say prayers for healing, or an ancient philosopher and physician would apply bloodletting according to the theories of humorism . In recent centuries, since the advent of modern science , most medicine has become a combination of art and science (both basic and applied , under the umbrella of medical science ). While stitching technique for sutures is an art learned through practice, the knowledge of what happens at the cellular and molecular level in the tissues being stitched arises through science.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health

Health is a state of physical, mental and social well-being in which disease and infirmity are absent. [1]
The meaning of health has evolved over time. In keeping with the biomedical perspective, early definitions of health focused on the theme of the body's ability to function; health was seen as a state of normal function that could be disrupted from time to time by disease . An example of such a definition of health is: "a state characterized by anatomic, physiologic, and psychological integrity; ability to perform personally valued family, work, and community roles; ability to deal with physical , biological , psychological , and social stress ". [2] Then in 1948, in a radical departure from previous definitions, the World Health Organization (WHO) proposed a definition that aimed higher: linking health to well-being , in terms of "physical, mental, and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease and infirmity". [3] Although this definition was welcomed by some as being innovative, it was also criticized as being vague, excessively broad and was not construed as measurable. For a long time, it was set aside as an impractical ideal and most discussions of health returned to the practicality of the biomedical model. [4]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease

A disease is a particular abnormal condition that negatively affects the structure or function of all or part of an organism, and that is not due to any immediate external injury. [1] [2] Diseases are often known to be medical conditions that are associated with specific signs and symptoms . A disease may be caused by external factors such as pathogens or by internal dysfunctions.  For example, internal dysfunctions of the immune system can produce a variety of different diseases, including various forms of immunodeficiency , hypersensitivity , allergies and autoimmune disorders .
In humans, disease is often used more broadly to refer to any condition that causes pain , dysfunction , distress , social problems , or death to the person afflicted, or similar problems for those in contact with the person. In this broader sense, it sometimes includes injuries , disabilities , disorders , syndromes , infections , isolated symptoms , deviant behaviors , and atypical variations of structure and function, while in other contexts and for other purposes these may be considered distinguishable categories. Diseases can affect people not only physically, but also mentally, as contracting and living with a disease can alter the affected person's perspective on life.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)
In medicine , describing a disease as acute denotes that it is of short duration and, as a corollary of that, of recent onset . The quantification of how much time constitutes "short" and "recent" varies by disease and by context, but the core denotation of "acute" is always qualitatively in contrast with " chronic ", which denotes long-lasting disease (for example, in acute leukaemia and chronic leukaemia ). In addition, "acute" also often connotes two other meanings: sudden onset and severity , such as in acute myocardial infarction (AMI), where suddenness and severity are both established aspects of the meaning. It thus often connotes that the condition is fulminant (as in the AMI example), but not always (as in acute rhinitis , which is usually synonymous with the common cold ). The one thing that acute MI and acute rhinitis have in common is that they are not chronic. They can happen again (as in recurrent pneumonia , that is, multiple acute pneumonia episodes), but they are not the same case ongoing for months or years (unlike chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , which is).
A noncount sense of "acute disease" refers to the acute phase, that is, a short course, of any disease entity. [1] [2] For example, in an article on ulcerative enteritis in poultry , the author says, "in acute disease there may be increased mortality without any obvious signs ", [3] referring to the acute form or phase of ulcerative enteritis.
Not all acute diseases or injuries are severe, and vice versa. For example, a mild stubbed toe is an acute injury. Similarly, many acute upper respiratory infections and acute gastroenteritis cases in adults are mild and usually resolve within a few days or weeks.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect_(medicine)
An adverse effect is an undesired harmful effect resulting from a medication or other intervention , such as surgery . [1] An adverse effect may be termed a " side effect ", when judged to be secondary to a main or therapeutic effect . If it results from an unsuitable or incorrect dosage or procedure, this is called a medical error and not a complication . Adverse effects are sometimes referred to as " iatrogenic " because they are generated by a physician /treatment. Some adverse effects occur only when starting, increasing or discontinuing a treatment. Adverse effects can also be caused by placebo treatments (in which case the adverse effects are referred to as nocebo effects). [2] [3] Using a drug or other medical intervention which is contraindicated may increase the risk of adverse effects. Adverse effects may cause complications of a disease or procedure and negatively affect its prognosis . They may also lead to non-compliance with a treatment regimen. Adverse effects of medical treatment resulted in 142,000 deaths in 2013 up from 94,000 deaths in 1990 globally. [4]
The harmful outcome is usually indicated by some result such as morbidity , mortality , alteration in body weight , levels of enzymes , loss of function, or as a pathological change detected at the microscopic, macroscopic or physiological level. It may also be indicated by symptoms reported by a patient. Adverse effects may cause a reversible or irreversible change, including an increase or decrease in the susceptibility of the individual to other chemicals, foods , or procedures, such as drug interactions .
In terms of drugs, adverse events may be defined as: “Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment.” [5]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiseptic
Antiseptics (from Greek ἀντί anti , "against" [1] and σηπτικός sēptikos , "putrefactive" [2] ) are antimicrobial substances that are applied to living tissue / skin to reduce the possibility of infection , sepsis , or putrefaction . Antiseptics are generally distinguished from antibiotics by the latter's ability to safely destroy bacteria within the body, and from disinfectants , which destroy microorganisms found on non-living objects. [3]
Some antiseptics are true germicides , capable of destroying microbes ( bacteriocidal ), while others are bacteriostatic and only prevent or inhibit their growth. [4]
Antibacterials include antiseptics that have the proven ability to act against bacteria. Microbicides which destroy virus particles are called viricides or antivirals . Antifungals , also known as antimycotics , are pharmaceutical fungicides used to treat and prevent mycosis (fungal infection).
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antivenom
Antivenom , also known as antivenin , venom antiserum , and antivenom immunoglobulin , is a specific treatment for envenomation . It is composed of antibodies and used to treat certain venomous bites and stings. [1] Antivenoms are recommended only if there is significant toxicity or a high risk of toxicity. [1] The specific antivenom needed depends on the species involved. [1] It is given by injection. [1]
Side effects may be severe. [1] They include serum sickness , shortness of breath , and allergic reactions including anaphylaxis . [1] Antivenom is traditionally made by collecting venom from the relevant animal and injecting small amounts of it into a domestic animal. [2] The antibodies that form are then collected from the domestic animal's blood and purified. [2] Versions are available for spider bites , snake bites , fish stings , and scorpion stings . [3] Due to the high cost of producing antibody-based antivenoms and their short shelf lives when not refrigerated, alternative methods of production of antivenoms are being actively explored. [4] One such different method of production involves production from bacteria. [5] Another approach is to develop targeted drugs (which, unlike antibodies, are usually synthetic and easier to manufacture at scale). [6]
Antivenom was first developed in the late 19th century and came into common use in the 1950s. [2] [7] It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines . [8]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apgar_score
The Apgar score is a method to quickly summarize the health of newborn children against infant mortality . [1] [2] Virginia Apgar , an anesthesiologist at New York–Presbyterian Hospital , developed the score in 1952 to quantify the effects of obstetric anesthesia on babies. [3]
The Apgar score is determined by evaluating the newborn baby on five simple criteria on a scale from zero to two, then summing up the five values thus obtained. The resulting score ranges from zero to 10. [4] The five criteria are summarized using words chosen to form a backronym : appearance, pulse, grimace, activity, respiration. [5]
The test is generally done at 1 and 5 minutes after birth and may be repeated later if the score is and remains low. Scores of 7 and above are generally normal; 4 to 6, fairly low; and 3 and below are generally regarded as critically low and cause for immediate resuscitative efforts. [6]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon_plasma_coagulation
Argon plasma coagulation ( APC ) is a medical endoscopic procedure used to control bleeding from certain lesions in the gastrointestinal tract . It is administered during esophagogastroduodenoscopy or colonoscopy .
APC involves the use of a jet of ionized argon gas ( plasma ) directed through a probe passed through the endoscope . The probe is placed at some distance from the bleeding lesion, and argon gas is emitted, then ionized by a high-voltage discharge (approx 6 kV ). [1] High-frequency electric current is then conducted through the jet of gas, resulting in coagulation of the bleeding lesion. As no physical contact is made with the lesion, the procedure is safe if the bowel has been cleaned of colonic gases, [2] [3] and can be used to treat bleeding in parts of the gastrointestinal tract with thin walls, such as the cecum . The depth of coagulation is usually only a few millimetres.
APC is used to treat the following conditions:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asepsis
Asepsis is the state of being free from disease-causing micro-organisms (such as pathogenic bacteria , viruses , pathogenic fungi , and parasites ). [1] There are two categories of asepsis: medical and surgical. [1] The modern day notion of asepsis is derived from the older antiseptic techniques, a shift initiated by different individuals in the 19th century who introduced practices such as the sterilizing of surgical tools and the wearing of surgical gloves during operations. [2] The goal of asepsis is to eliminate infection, not to achieve sterility. [1] Ideally, a surgical field is sterile , meaning it is free of all biological contaminants (e.g. fungi, bacteria, viruses), not just those that can cause disease, putrefaction , or fermentation . [1] Even in an aseptic state, a condition of sterile inflammation may develop. The term often refers to those practices used to promote or induce asepsis in an operative field of surgery or medicine to prevent infection . [3]
The modern concept of asepsis evolved in the 19th century through multiple individuals. Ignaz Semmelweis showed that hand washing prior to delivery reduced puerperal fever . Despite this, many hospitals continued to practice surgery in unsanitary conditions, wit
h some surgeons taking pride in their bloodstained operating gowns. [4] It was not until after reading of the findings by Louis Pasteur that Joseph Lister introduced the use of carbolic acid as an antiseptic, and in doing so, reduced surgical infection rates. [5] Lawson Tait shifted the movement then from antisepsis to asepsis, instilling practices such as a strict no-talking policy within his operating room and drastically limiting the number of people to come in contact with a patient's wound. [6] Ernst von Bergmann also introduced the autoclave , a device used for the practice of the sterilization of surgical instruments. [7]
But, everything from operating room uniforms to gloves was pioneered by William Halsted . Preceding modern-day scrubs attire, Halsted implemented a no street clothes policy in his operating room, opting to wear a completely white, sterile uniform consisting of a duck suit , tennis shoes , and skullcap . [2] This helped to prevent the introduction of infections into open wounds. [2] Additionally, Halsted would sterilize the operation site with alcohol, iodine and other disinfectants and use drapes to cover all areas except for the site. [2] In his department at Johns Hopkins Hospital , he enforced an extreme hand washing ritual consisting of soaking in harmfully strong chemicals like permanganate and mercury bichloride solution as well as scrubbing with stiff brushes. [2] The damage to a surgical nurse's hands compelled him to create the earliest form of the surgical gloves with the Goodyear Rubber Company . [2] These gloves became a part of the aseptic surgery standard when Dr. Joseph Colt Bloodgood and several others began wearing them for that particular purpose. [8]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_reproduction_number

(wild type)
In epidemiology , the basic reproduction number , or basic reproductive number (sometimes called basic reproduction ratio or basic reproductive rate ), denoted R 0 {\displaystyle R_{0}} (pronounced R nought or R zero ), [19] of an infection is the expected number of cases directly generated by one case in a population where all individuals are susceptible to infection. [15] The definition assumes that no other individuals are infected or immunized (naturally or through vaccination ). Some definitions, such as that of the Australian Department of Health , add the absence of "any deliberate intervention in disease transmission". [20] The basic reproduction number is not the same as the effective reproduction number R {\displaystyle R} (usually written R t {\displaystyle R_{t}} [ t for time], sometimes R e {\displaystyle R_{e}} ), [21] which is the number of cases generated in the current state of a population, which does not have to be the uninfected state. R 0 {\displaystyle R_{0}} is a dimensionless number and not a rate, which would have units of time −1 , [22] or units of time like doubling time . [23]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beating_heart_cadaver
A beating heart cadaver is a body that is pronounced dead in all medical and legal definitions, connected to a medical ventilator , and retains cardio-pulmonary functions. This keeps the organs of the body, including the heart , functioning and alive. [1] As a result, the period of time in which the organs may be used for transplantation is extended. The heart contains pacemaker cells that will cause it to continue beating even when a patient is brain-dead . Other organs in the body do not have this capability and need the brain to be functioning to send signals to the organs to carry out their functions. A beating heart cadaver requires a ventilator to provide oxygen to its blood, but the heart will continue to beat on its own even in the absence of brain activity. [2] This allows organs to be preserved for a longer period of time in the case of a transplant or donation. A small number of cases in recent years indicate that it can also be implemented for a brain-dead pregnant woman to reach the full term of her pregnancy. [2] There is an advantage to beating heart cadaver organ donation because doctors are able to see the vitals of the organs and tell if they are stable and functioning before transplanting to an ailing patient. [3] This is not possible in a donation from someone pronounced dead.
The observed phenomena of lifelike qualities after death is not a new concept. In René Descartes ' Discourse on the Method , he notes that decapitated animals move and display characteristics of a living body a few seconds after decapitation which was published in 1637. [4] This continued into the French Revolution where it was observed that people who had been beheaded showed movements in facial muscles and hearts could continue to beat for almost an hour past the time of beheading. [5] The guillotine in some cases did not completely sever head from body. In 1875 an examiner named Pierre Jean Cabanis was assigned the duty of making sure a body was truly dead. [4] There were also stories involving beheadings where the victims would stand up and walk around before falling dead. The ambiguity around brain death and true death has followed it to present day. In an effort to clarify some of these gray areas, the Harvard Medical Committee developed criteria for identifying a body as dead in 1968. [4] [5] These criteria required patients to be completely unaware and unresponsive to external stimuli, have no spontaneous muscle movements, and exhibit no reflexive response even when manipulated. They also required that an electroencephalography ( EEG ) show no signs of activity. [4] The purpose of this report was to encourage physicians to distinguish brain death and irreversible coma from a persistent vegetative state where the patient still has some awareness and cycles through sleep and wakefulness. [6]
In 1971 a similar Minnesota criteria was published eliminating the EEG, repeating the exam after 12 hours, a severe lesion in the brain, and increasing the duration of the apnea test to four minutes rather than Harvard's three minute guideline. Other slight changes in the next decades included the United Kingdom's decision to eliminate the repetition of the exam and change from a duration of the apnea test to specified levels of CO 2 in 1976. [5] Later, in 1981 the President's Commission reinstated the apnea test and the repeat exam. In a study done in 1989, only 35% of 195 physicians and nurses involved in organ procurement polled knew brain death criteria. These were not the same nurses and physicians who diagnose brain death. Presently, there is hot debate over the protocol for diagnosing someone as brain dead due to widespread disinformation and misinformation on the internet. [7]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behaviour_therapy
Behaviour therapy or behavioural psychotherapy is a broad term referring to clinical psychotherapy that uses techniques derived from behaviourism and/or cognitive psychology . It looks at specific, learned behaviours and how the environment, or other people's mental states , influences those behaviours, and consists of techniques based on learning theory, such as respondent or operant conditioning . Behaviourists who practice these techniques are either behaviour analysts or cognitive-behavioural therapists . [1] They tend to look for treatment outcomes that are objectively measurable. [2] Behaviour therapy does not involve one specific method, but it has a wide range of techniques that can be used to treat a person's psychological problems. [3]
Behavioural psychotherapy is sometimes juxtaposed with cognitive psychotherapy . While cognitive behavioural therapy integrates aspects of both approaches, such as cognitive restructuring , positive reinforcement , habituation (or desensitisation ), counterconditioning , and modelling .
Applied behaviour analysis (ABA) is the application of behaviour analysis that focuses on functionally assessing how behaviour is influenced by the observable learning environment and how to change such behaviour through contingency management or exposure therapies , which are used throughout clinical behaviour analysis therapies or other interventions based on the same learning principles.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benign
Benignity (from Latin benignus "kind, good", itself deriving from bonus "good" and genus "origin") is any condition that is harmless in the long run. The opposite of benignity is malignity (or malignancy in medical discourse ).
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioethics
Bioethics is the study of the ethical issues emerging from advances in biology and medicine .  It is also moral discernment as it relates to medical policy and practice. Bioethics are concerned with the ethical questions that arise in the relationships among life sciences , biotechnology , medicine and medical ethics , politics , law , theology and philosophy . [1] It includes the study of values relating to primary care and other branches of medicine ( "the ethics of the ordinary" ). Ethics also relates to many other sciences outside the realm of biological sciences.
The term Bioethics ( Greek bios , life; ethos , behavior) was coined in 1926 by Fritz Jahr in an article about a "bioethical imperative" regarding the use of animals and plants in scientific research. [2] In 1970, the American biochemist Van Rensselaer Potter used the term to describe the relationship between the biosphere and a growing human population. Potter's work laid the foundation for global ethics , a discipline centered around the link between biology, ecology, medicine, and human values. [3] [4] Sargent Shriver, the spouse of Eunice Kennedy Shriver, claimed that he had invented the word "bioethics" in the living room of his home in Bethesda, Maryland in 1970. He stated that he thought of the word after returning from a discussion earlier that evening at Georgetown University, where he discussed with others a possible Kennedy family sponsorship of an institute focused around the "application of moral philosophy to concrete medical dilemmas." [5]
The field of bioethics has addressed a broad swathe of human inquiry; ranging from debates over the boundaries of life (e.g. abortion , euthanasia ), surrogacy, the allocation of scarce health care resources (e.g. organ donation , health care rationing ), to the right to refuse medical care for religious or cultural reasons.  Bioethicists often disagree among themselves over the precise limits of their discipline, debating whether the field should concern itself with the ethical evaluation of all questions involving biology and medicine, or only a subset of these questions. [6] Some bioethicists would narrow ethical evaluation only to the morality of medical treatments or technological innovations, and the timing of medical treatment of humans. Others would broaden the scope of ethical evaluation to include the morality of all actions that might help or harm organisms capable of feeling fear.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomedical_engineering
Biomedical engineering ( BME ) or medical engineering is the application of engineering principles and design concepts to medicine and biology for healthcare purposes (e.g., diagnostic or therapeutic). BME is also traditionally known as "bioengineering", but this term has come to also refer to biological engineering . This field seeks to close the gap between engineering and medicine , combining the design and problem-solving skills of engineering with medical biological sciences to advance health care treatment, including diagnosis , monitoring , and therapy . [1] [2] Also included under the scope of a biomedical engineer is the management of current medical equipment in hospitals while adhering to relevant industry standards. This involves making equipment recommendations, procurement, routine testing, and preventive maintenance, a role also known as a Biomedical Equipment Technician (BMET) or as clinical engineering .
Biomedical engineering has recently emerged as its own study, as compared to many other engineering fields. Such an evolution is common as a new field transitions from being an interdisciplinary specialization among already-established fields to being considered a field in itself. Much of the work in biomedical engineering consists of research and development , spanning a broad array of subfields (see below). Prominent biomedical engineering applications include the development of biocompatible prostheses , various diagnostic and therapeutic medical devices ranging from clinical equipment to micro-implants, common imaging equipment such as MRIs and EKG /ECGs, regenerative tissue growth, pharmaceutical drugs and therapeutic biologicals.
Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary field that develops methods and software tools for understanding biological data. As an interdisciplinary field of science, bioinformatics combines computer science, statistics, mathematics, and engineering to analyze and interpret biological data.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_defect
A birth defect , also known as a congenital disorder , is a condition present at birth regardless of its cause. [3] Birth defects may result in disabilities that may be physical , intellectual , or developmental . [3] The disabilities can range from mild to severe. [7] Birth defects are divided into two main types: structural disorders in which problems are seen with the shape of a body part and functional disorders in which problems exist with how a body part works. [4] Functional disorders include metabolic and degenerative disorders . [4] Some birth defects include both structural and functional disorders. [4]
Birth defects may result from genetic or chromosomal disorders , exposure to certain medications or chemicals, or certain infections during pregnancy . [5] Risk factors include folate deficiency , drinking alcohol or smoking during pregnancy, poorly controlled diabetes , and a mother over the age of 35 years old. [6] [7] Many are believed to involve multiple factors. [7] Birth defects may be visible at birth or diagnosed by screening tests . [10] A number of defects can be detected before birth by different prenatal tests . [10]
Treatment varies depending on the defect in question. [8] This may include therapy , medication, surgery, or assistive technology . [8] Birth defects affected about 96 million people as of 2015. [11] In the United States, they occur in about 3% of newborns. [2] They resulted in about 628,000 deaths in 2015, down from 751,000 in 1990. [12] [9] The types with the greatest numbers of deaths are congenital heart disease (303,000), followed by neural tube defects (65,000). [9]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowel_obstruction

Bowel obstruction , also known as intestinal obstruction , is a mechanical or functional obstruction of the intestines which prevents the normal movement of the products of digestion . [2] [5] Either the small bowel or large bowel may be affected. [1] Signs and symptoms include abdominal pain , vomiting , bloating and not passing gas . [1] Mechanical obstruction is the cause of about 5 to 15% of cases of severe abdominal pain of sudden onset requiring admission to hospital. [1] [2]
Causes of bowel obstruction include adhesions , hernias , volvulus , endometriosis , inflammatory bowel disease , appendicitis , tumors , diverticulitis , ischemic bowel , tuberculosis and intussusception . [1] [2] Small bowel obstructions are most often due to adhesions and hernias while large bowel obstructions are most often due to tumors and volvulus. [1] [2] The diagnosis may be made on plain X-rays ; however, CT scan is more accurate. [1] Ultrasound or MRI may help in the diagnosis of children or pregnant women. [1]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brine
Brine is a high-concentration solution of salt (NaCl) in water (H 2 O).  In different contexts, brine may refer to salt solutions ranging from about 3.5% (a typical concentration of seawater , on the lower end of solutions used for brining foods) up to about 26% (a typical saturated solution , depending on temperature). Lower levels of concentration are called by different names: fresh water , brackish water , and saline water .
Brine naturally occurs on the Earth's surface ( salt lakes ), crust, and within brine pools on ocean bottom. High-concentration brine lakes typically emerge due to evaporation of ground saline water on high ambient temperatures. Brine is used for food processing and cooking ( pickling and brining ), for de-icing of roads and other structures, and in a number of technological processes. It is also a by-product of many industrial processes , such as desalination , and may pose an environmental risk due to its corrosive and toxic effects, so it requires wastewater treatment for proper disposal or further utilization ( fresh water recovery). [1]
Saline water with relatively high concentration of salt (usually sodium chloride ) occurs naturally on Earth's surface ( salt lakes ), crust, and within brine pools on ocean bottom.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childbed_fever
Postpartum infections , also known as childbed fever and puerperal fever , are any bacterial infections of the female reproductive tract following childbirth or miscarriage . [1] Signs and symptoms usually include a fever greater than 38.0 °C (100.4 °F), chills, lower abdominal pain, and possibly bad-smelling vaginal discharge . [1] It usually occurs after the first 24 hours and within the first ten days following delivery. [5]
The most common infection is that of the uterus and surrounding tissues known as puerperal sepsis , postpartum metritis , or postpartum endometritis . [1] [6] Risk factors include Caesarean section (C-section), the presence of certain bacteria such as group B streptococcus in the vagina, premature rupture of membranes , multiple vaginal exams , manual removal of the placenta , and prolonged labour among others. [1] [2] Most infections involve a number of types of bacteria. [1] Diagnosis is rarely helped by culturing of the vagina or blood. [1] In those who do not improve, medical imaging may be required. [1] Other causes of fever following delivery include breast engorgement , urinary tract infections , infections of an abdominal incision or an episiotomy , and atelectasis . [1] [2]
Due to the risks following Caesarean section, it is recommended that all women receive a preventive dose of antibiotics such as ampicillin around the time of surgery. [1] Treatment of established infections is with antibiotics, with most people improving in two to three days. [1] In those with mild disease, oral antibiotics may be used; otherwise intravenous antibiotics are recommended. [1] Common antibiotics include a combination of ampicillin and gentamicin following vaginal delivery or clindamycin and gentamicin in those who have had a C-section. [1] In those who are not improving with appropriate treatment, other complications such an abscess should be considered. [1]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial

Clinical trials are experiments or observations done in clinical research . Such prospective biomedical or behavioral research studies on human participants are designed to answer specific questions about biomedical or behavioral interventions, including new treatments (such as novel vaccines , drugs , dietary choices , dietary supplements , and medical devices ) and known interventions that warrant further study and comparison. Clinical trials generate data on dosage, safety and efficacy . [1] They are conducted only after they have received health authority/ethics committee approval in the country where approval of the therapy is sought. These authorities are responsible for vetting the risk/benefit ratio of the trial—their approval does not mean the therapy is 'safe' or effective, only that the trial may be conducted.
Depending on product type and development stage, investigators initially enroll volunteers or patients into small pilot studies , and subsequently conduct progressively larger scale comparative studies. Clinical trials can vary in size and cost, and they can involve a single research center or multiple centers , in one country or in multiple countries. Clinical study design aims to ensure the scientific validity and reproducibility of the results.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive-behavioral_therapy

Cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT ) is a psycho-social intervention [1] [2] that aims to improve mental health . [3] CBT focuses on challenging and changing cognitive distortions (e.g. thoughts, beliefs, and attitudes) and behaviors, improving emotional regulation , [2] [4] and the development of personal coping strategies that target solving current problems. It was originally designed to treat depression , but its uses have been expanded to include treatment of a number of mental health conditions, including anxiety , [5] [6] alcohol and drug use problems, marital problems, and eating disorders. [7] [8] CBT includes a number of cognitive or behavior psychotherapies that treat defined psychopathologies using evidence-based techniques and strategies. [9] [10] [11]
CBT is based on the combination of the basic principles from behavioral and cognitive psychology . [2] It is different from historical approaches to psychotherapy , such as the psychoanalytic approach where the therapist looks for the unconscious meaning behind the behaviors and then formulates a diagnosis. Instead, CBT is a "problem-focused" and "action-oriented" form of therapy, meaning it is used to treat specific problems related to a diagnosed mental disorder. The therapist's role is to assist the client in finding and practicing effective strategies to address the identified goals and decrease symptoms of the disorder. [12] CBT is based on the belief that thought distortions and maladaptive behaviors play a role in the development and maintenance of psychological disorders , [3] and that symptoms and associated distress can be reduced by teaching new information-processing skills and coping mechanisms.

In medicine , comorbidity is the presence of one or more additional conditions often co-occurring (that is, concomitant or concurrent ) with a primary condition. Comorbidity describes the effect of all other conditions an individual patient might have other than the primary condition of interest, and can be physiological or psychological. In the context of mental health, comorbidity often refers to disorders that are often coexistent with each other, such as depression and anxiety disorders.
Comorbidity can indicate either a condition existing simultaneously, but independently with another condition or a related medical condition. The latter sense of the term causes some overlap with the concept of complications . For example, in longstanding diabetes mellitus , the extent to which coronary artery disease is an independent comorbidity versus a diabetic complication is not easy to measure, because both diseases are quite multivariate and there are likely aspects of both simultaneity and consequence. The same is true of intercurrent diseases in pregnancy . In other examples, the true independence or relation is not ascertainable because syndromes and associations are often identified long before pathogenetic commonalities are confirmed (and, in some examples, before they are even hypothesized ). In psychiatric diagnoses it has been argued in part that this "'use of imprecise language may lead to correspondingly imprecise thinking', [and] this usage of the term 'comorbidity' should probably be avoided." [1] However, in many medical examples, such as comorbid diabetes mellitus and coronary artery disease, it makes little difference which word is used, as long as the medical complexity is duly recognized and addressed.
Many tests attempt to standardize the "weight" or value of comorbid conditions, whether they are secondary or tertiary illnesses. Each test attempts to consolidate each individual comorbid condition into a single, predictive variable that measures mortality or other outcomes. Researchers have validated such tests because of their predictive value, but no one test is as yet recognized as a  standard.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compliance_(medicine)
In medicine, patient compliance (also adherence , capacitance ) describes the degree to which a patient correctly follows medical advice. Most commonly, it refers to medication or drug compliance, but it can also apply to other situations such as medical device use, self care , self-directed exercises, or therapy sessions. Both patient and health-care provider affect compliance, and a positive physician-patient relationship is the most important factor in improving compliance, [1] The cost of prescription medication also plays a major role. [2]
Compliance can be confused with concordance , which is the process by which a patient and clinician make decisions together about treatment. [3]
Worldwide, non-compliance is a major obstacle to the effective delivery of health care. 2003 estimates from the World Health Organization indicated that only about 50% of patients with chronic diseases living in developed countries follow treatment recommendations with particularly low rates of adherence to therapies for asthma , diabetes , and hypertension . [1] Major barriers to compliance are thought to include the complexity of modern medication regimens, poor "health literacy" and not understanding treatment benefits, occurrence of undiscussed side effects, poor treatment satisfaction, cost of prescription medicine, and poor communication or lack of trust between a patient and his or her health-care provider. [4] [5] [6] [7] Efforts to improve compliance have been aimed at simplifying medication packaging, providing effective medication reminders, improving patient education, and limiting the number of medications prescribed simultaneously. Studies show a great variation in terms of characteristics and effects of interventions to improve medicine adherence. [8] It is still unclear how adherence can consistently be improved in order to promote clinically important effects. [8]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cow_urine

Cow urine is a liquid by-product of metabolism in cows. Cow urine is also used in medicine in India , Myanmar , Nepal , and Nigeria . While cow urine and cow dung have benefits as fertilizers, the proponents' claims about its curing diseases and cancer have no scientific backing. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5]
Some Hindus claim that cow urine has a special significance as a medicinal drink. [6] [1] The sprinkling of cow urine is said to have a spiritual cleansing effect as well. [7] [8]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryonics

Cryonics (from Greek : κρύος kryos meaning 'cold') is the low-temperature freezing (usually at −196 °C or −320.8 °F or 77.1 K) and storage of a human corpse or severed head, with the speculative hope that resurrection may be possible in the future. [1] [2] Cryonics is regarded with skepticism within the mainstream scientific community. It is generally viewed as a pseudoscience , [3] and its practice has been characterized as quackery . [4] [5]
Cryonics procedures can begin only after clinical death , and cryonics "patients" are legally dead . Cryonics procedures may begin within minutes of death, [6] and use cryoprotectants to prevent ice formation during cryopreservation. [7] It is, however, not possible for a corpse to be reanimated after undergoing vitrification , as this causes damage to the brain including its neural networks . [8] The first corpse to be frozen was that of Dr. James Bedford in 1967. [9] As of 2014, about 250 dead bodies had been cryopreserved in the United States , and 1,500 people had made arrangements for cryopreservation of their corpses. [10]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis
Diagnosis is the identification of the nature and cause of a certain phenomenon. Diagnosis is used in many different disciplines , with variations in the use of logic , analytics , and experience, to determine " cause and effect ". In systems engineering and computer science , it is typically used to determine the causes of symptoms, mitigations, and solutions. [1]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine
Doctor of Medicine (abbreviated M.D. , from the Latin Medicinae Doctor ) is a medical degree , the meaning of which varies between different jurisdictions. In the United States , and some other countries, the M.D. denotes a professional graduate degree . This generally arose because many in 18th-century medical professions trained in Scotland , which used the M.D. degree nomenclature. In England, however, Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery was used and eventually in the 19th century became the standard in Scotland too. Thus, in the United Kingdom , Ireland and other countries, the M.D. is a research doctorate , higher doctorate , honorary doctorate or applied clinical degree restricted to those who already hold a professional degree in medicine; in those countries, the equivalent professional to the North American and some others use of M.D. is still typically titled Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery ( M.B.B.S. ). [2]
The first medical degrees were awarded by the Schola Medica Salernitana around the year 1000, including to women such as Trota of Salerno . [3] [4] The degrees received legal sanction in 1137 by Roger II of Sicily and in 1231 by Emperor Federico II , in the Constitution of Melfi . [5] In the titles XLIV-LXXXIX of the third book of the Constitutions of 1231, it was established that the activity of a physician ( medicus ) could only be carried out by physicians holding a medical degree, the Licentia Medendi (license to practice medicine), by the Schola Medica Salernitana (the only school in the kingdom authorized to award degrees in medicine). [3] [6] This degree was awarded after a curriculum composed of three years of study of logic , five years of medical studies , an examination of a commission composed of the professors of the university, a one-year apprenticeship with an expert doctor, and a final examination before the commissioners of the Royal Curia and the Provincial Curias. [6]
In 1703, the University of Glasgow 's first medical graduate, Samuel Benion, was issued with the academic degree of Doctor of Medicine. [7]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor-patient_relationship
A doctor-patient relationship is a complex relationship between a doctor and a patient . This relationship is formed when a doctor attends to a patient's medical needs and is usually through consent. [1] This unique relationship is built on trust, respect, communication, and a common understanding of both the doctor and patients' sides. The trust aspect of this relationship goes both ways, the doctor trusts the patient to reveal any information that may be relevant to the case and in turn, the patient trusts the doctor to respect their privacy and not disclose this information to outside parties. An important dynamic of this relationship is that the doctor is bonded by oath to follow certain ethical guidelines ( Hippocratic Oath ) whereas the patient is not. [2] [3] It is important to remember that the doctor–patient relationship is a central part of health care and the practice of medicine . Additionally, the healthiness of a doctor-patient relationship is essential to keep the quality of the patient's healthcare high as well as to ensure that the doctor is functioning at their optimum. In more recent times healthcare has become more patient-centered and this has brought a new dynamic to this ancient relationship.
A patient must have confidence in the competence of their physician and must feel that they can confide in him or her. For most physicians, the establishment of good rapport with a patient is important.  Some medical specialties, such as psychiatry and family medicine , emphasize the physician–patient relationship more than others, such as pathology or radiology , which have very little contact with patients.
The quality of the patient–physician relationship is important to both parties. The doctor and patient's values and perspectives about disease, life, and time available play a role in building up this relationship. A strong relationship between the doctor and patient may lead to frequent, freely-offered quality information about the patient's disease and as a result, better healthcare for the patient and their family. Enhancing both the accuracy of the diagnosis and the patient's knowledge about the disease contributes to a good relationship between the doctor and the patient. [4] In a poor doctor-patient relationship, the physician's ability to make a full assessment may be compromised and the patient may be more likely to distrust the diagnosis and proposed treatment. The downstream effects of this mistrust may include decreased patient adherence to the physician's medical advice , which could result in poorer health outcomes for the patient. In these circumstances, and also in cases where there is genuine divergence of medical opinions, a second opinion from another physician may be sought, or the patient may choose to go to another physician that they trust more. Additionally, the benefits of any placebo effect are also based upon the patient's subjective assessment (conscious or unconscious) of the physician's credibility and skills. [5]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabethan_collar
An Elizabethan collar , E-collar , Buster collar or pet cone (sometimes humorously called a pet lamp-shade , pet radar dish , dog-saver , or cone of shame ) is a protective medical device worn by an animal, usually a cat or dog. Shaped like a truncated cone, its purpose is to prevent the animal from biting or licking at its body or scratching at its head or neck while wounds or injuries heal . [1] The collars are named from the ruffs worn in Elizabethan times .  A U.S. patent was filed by Frank L. Johnson in 1959. [2]
The device is generally attached to the pet's usual collar with strings or tabs passed through holes punched in the sides of the plastic. The neck of the collar should be short enough to let the animal eat and drink. Although most pets adjust to them quite well, others will not eat or drink with the collar in place and the collar is temporarily removed for meals. [3]
While purpose-made collars can be purchased from veterinarians or pet stores, they can also be made from plastic and cardboard or by using plastic flowerpots, wastebaskets, buckets or lampshades. Modern collars might involve soft fabric trim along the edges to increase comfort and velcro surfaces for ease of attachment and removal.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENCODE
The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements ( ENCODE ) is a public research project which aims to identify functional elements in the human genome .
Encode was launched by the US National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) in September 2003. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] Intended as a follow-up to the Human Genome Project , the ENCODE project aims to identify all functional elements in the human genome .
The project involves a worldwide consortium of research groups, and data generated from this project can be accessed through public databases. The project began its fourth phase in February 2017. [7]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eradication_of_infectious_diseases

Eradication is the reduction of an infectious disease 's prevalence in the global host population to zero. [1] It is sometimes confused with elimination, which describes either the reduction of an infectious disease's prevalence in a regional population to zero or the reduction of the global prevalence to a negligible amount. Further confusion arises from the use of the term eradication to refer to the total removal of a given pathogen from an individual (also known as clearance of an infection ), particularly in the context of HIV and certain other viruses where such cures are sought.
The selection of infectious diseases for eradication is based on rigorous criteria, as both biological and technical features determine whether a pathogenic organism is (at least potentially) eradicable. The targeted organism must not have a non-human reservoir (or, in the case of animal diseases, the infection reservoir must be an easily identifiable species, as in the case of rinderpest ), and/or amplify in the environment. This implies that sufficient information on the life cycle and transmission dynamics is available at the time an eradication initiative is programmed. An efficient and practical intervention (such as a vaccine or antibiotic) must be available to interrupt transmission of the infective agent. Studies of measles in the pre-vaccination era led to the concept of the critical community size , the size of the population below which a pathogen ceases to circulate. [2] The use of vaccination programs before the introduction of an eradication campaign can reduce the susceptible population. The disease to be eradicated should be clearly identifiable, and an accurate diagnostic tool should exist. Economic considerations, as well as societal and political support and commitment, are other crucial factors that determine eradication feasibility. [3] [4]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_(medicine)
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetal_viability
Fetal viability or foetal viability is the ability of a fetus to survive outside the uterus . [1]
Viability , as the word has been used in United States constitutional law since Roe v. Wade , is the potential of the fetus to survive outside the uterus after birth, natural or induced, when supported by up-to-date medicine. Fetal viability depends largely on the fetal organ maturity, and environmental conditions. [2] According to Websters Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary of the English Language, viability of a fetus means having reached such a stage of development as to be capable of living, under normal conditions, outside the uterus. Viability exists as a function of biomedical and technological capacities, which are different in different parts of the world. As a consequence, there is, at the present time, no worldwide, uniform gestational age that defines viability. [3]
According to the McGraw-Hill medical dictionary a nonviable fetus is "an expelled or delivered fetus which, although living, cannot possibly survive to the point of sustaining life independently, even with support of the best available medical therapy." [4] A legal definition states: "Nonviable means not capable of living, growing, or developing and functioning successfully. It is antithesis of viable, which is defined as having attained such form and development of organs as to be normally capable of living outside the uterus." [Wolfe v. Isbell, 291 Ala. 327, 329 (Ala. 1973)] [5]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Geneva_Convention
The First Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded in Armies in the Field, held on 22 August 1864, is the first of four treaties of the Geneva Conventions . It defines "the basis on which rest the rules of international law for the protection of the victims of armed conflicts." [1] After the first treaty was adopted in 1864, it was significantly revised and replaced in 1906, 1929, and finally 1949. It is inextricably linked to the International Committee of the Red Cross , which is both the instigator for the inception and enforcer of the articles in these conventions.
The 1864 Geneva Convention was instituted at a critical period in European political and military history. Elsewhere, the American Civil War had been raging since 1861, and would ultimately claim between 750,000 and 900,000 lives. Between the fall of Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 and the rise of his nephew in the Italian campaign of 1859 , the powers had maintained peace in western Europe. [2] Yet, with the 1853–1856 conflict in the Crimea , war had returned to Europe, and while those troubles were "in a distant and inaccessible region" northern Italy was "so accessible from all parts of western Europe that it instantly filled with curious observers;" while the bloodshed was not excessive the sight of it was unfamiliar and shocking. [2] Despite its intent of ameliorating the ravages of war, the inception of the 1864 Geneva Convention inaugurated "a renewal of military activity on a large scale, to which the people of western Europe…had not been accustomed since the first Napoleon had been eliminated." [2]
The movement for an international set of laws governing the treatment and care for the wounded and prisoners of war began when relief activist Henry Dunant witnessed the Battle of Solferino in 1859, fought between French- Piedmontese and Austrian armies in Northern Italy. [3] The subsequent suffering of 40,000 wounded soldiers left on the field due to lack of facilities, personnel, and truces to give them medical aid moved Dunant into action. Upon return to Geneva , Dunant published his account Un Souvenir de Solferino . [4] He urged the calling together of an international conference and soon co-founded the International Committee of the Red Cross in 1863. [5]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folding@home
Folding@home ( FAH or F@h ) is a distributed computing project aimed to help scientists develop new therapeutics for a variety of diseases by the means of simulating protein dynamics. This includes the process of protein folding and the movements of proteins, and is reliant on simulations run on volunteers' personal computers. [4] Folding@home is currently based at Washington University in St. Louis and led by Greg Bowman, a former student of Vijay Pande . [5]
The project utilizes central processing units (CPUs), graphics processing units (GPUs), PlayStation 3s , Message Passing Interface (used for computing on multi-core processors ), and some Sony Xperia smartphones for distributed computing and scientific research. The project uses statistical simulation methodology that is a paradigm shift from traditional computing methods. [6] As part of the client–server model network architecture , the volunteered machines each receive pieces of a simulation (work units), complete them, and return them to the project's database servers , where the units are compiled into an overall simulation. Volunteers can track their contributions on the Folding@home website, which makes volunteers' participation competitive and encourages long-term involvement.
Folding@home is one of the world's fastest computing systems. With heightened interest in the project as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic , [7] the system achieved a speed of approximately 1.22 exaflops by late March 2020 and reached 2.43 exaflops by April 12, 2020, [8] making it the world's first exaflop computing system . This level of performance from its large-scale computing network has allowed researchers to run computationally costly atomic-level simulations of protein folding thousands of times longer than formerly achieved. Since its launch on October 1, 2000, the Pande Lab has produced 225 scientific research papers as a direct result of Folding@home. [9] Results from the project's simulations agree well with experiments. [10] [11] [12]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_counselling
Genetic counseling is the process of advising individuals and families affected by or at risk of genetic disorders to help them understand and adapt to the medical, psychological and familial implications of genetic contributions to disease; this field is considered necessary for the implementation of genomic medicine. [1] [2] The process integrates:
The practice of advising people about inherited traits began around the turn of the 20th century, shortly after William Bateson suggested that the new medical and biological study of heredity be called “genetics”. [3] Heredity became intertwined with social reforms when the field of modern eugenics took form. Although initially well-intentioned, ultimately the movement had disastrous consequences; many states in the United States had laws mandating the sterilization of certain individuals, others were not allowed to immigrate and by the 1930s these ideas were accepted by many other countries including in Germany where euthanasia for the “genetically defective” was legalized in 1939. [3] This part of the history of genetics is at the heart of the now “non directive” approach to genetic counseling. [4]
Sheldon Clark Reed coined the term genetic counseling in 1947 and published the book Counseling in Medical Genetics in 1955. [5] Most of the early genetic counseling clinics were run by non-medical scientists or by those who were not experienced clinicians. [6] With the growth in knowledge of genetic disorders and the appearance of medical genetics as a distinct specialty in the 1960s, genetic counseling progressively became medicalized, representing one of the key components of clinical genetics. [7] It was not, though, until later that the importance of a firm psychological basis was recognized and became an essential part of genetic counseling, the writings of Seymour Kessler making a particular contribution to this. [8] The first master's degree genetic counseling program in the United States was founded in 1969 at Sarah Lawrence College in Bronxville, New York. [9] In 1979, the National Society of Genetic Counselors (NSGC) was founded and led by the first president, Audrey Heimler. [10]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_screening
Genetic testing , also known as DNA testing , is used to identify changes in DNA sequence or chromosome structure. Genetic testing can also include measuring the results of genetic changes, such as RNA analysis as an output of gene expression , or through biochemical analysis to measure specific protein output. [1] In a medical setting, genetic testing can be used to diagnose or rule out suspected genetic disorders, predict risks for specific conditions, or gain information that can be used to customize medical treatments based on an individual's genetic makeup. [1] Genetic testing can also be used to determine biological relatives, such as a child's parentage (genetic mother and father) through DNA paternity testing , [2] or be used to broadly predict an individual's ancestry . [3] Genetic testing of plants and animals can be used for similar reasons as in humans (e.g. to assess relatedness/ancestry or predict/diagnose genetic disorders), [4] to gain information used for selective breeding , [5] or for efforts to boost genetic diversity in endangered populations. [6]
The variety of genetic tests has expanded throughout the years. Early forms of genetic testing which began in the 1950s involved counting the number of chromosomes per cell. Deviations from the expected number of chromosomes (46 in humans) could lead to a diagnosis of certain genetic conditions such as trisomy 21 ( Down syndrome ) or monosomy X ( Turner syndrome ). [7] In the 1970s, a method to stain specific regions of chromosomes, called chromosome banding , was developed that allowed more detailed analysis of chromosome structure and diagnosis of genetic disorders that involved large structural rearrangements. [8] In addition to analyzing whole chromosomes ( cytogenetics ), genetic testing has expanded to include the fields of molecular genetics and genomics which can identify changes at the level of individual genes, parts of genes, or even single nucleotide "letters" of DNA sequence. [7] According to the National Institutes of Health , there are tests available for more than 2,000 genetic conditions, [9] and one study estimated that as of 2017 there were more than 75,000 genetic tests on the market. [10]
Genetic testing is "the analysis of chromosomes ( DNA ), proteins, and certain metabolites in order to detect heritable disease-related genotypes , mutations , phenotypes , or karyotypes for clinical purposes." [11] It can provide information about a person 's genes and chromosomes throughout life.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germ_theory_of_disease

The germ theory of disease is the currently accepted scientific theory for many diseases . It states that microorganisms known as pathogens or "germs" can lead to disease. These small organisms, too small to see without magnification, invade humans, other animals, and other living hosts. Their growth and reproduction within their hosts can cause disease. "Germ" may refer to not just a bacterium but to any type of microorganism, such as protists or fungi , or even non-living pathogens that can cause disease, such as viruses , prions , or viroids . [1] Diseases caused by pathogens are called infectious diseases . Even when a pathogen is the principal cause of a disease, environmental and hereditary factors often influence the severity of the disease, and whether a potential host individual becomes infected when exposed to the pathogen.
Basic forms of germ theory were proposed in the late Middle Ages by physicians including Ibn Sina in 1025, [2] Ibn Khatima and Ibn al-Khatib in the 14th century, [3] Girolamo Fracastoro in 1546, and expanded upon by Marcus von Plenciz in 1762. However, such views were held in disdain in Europe, where Galen's miasma theory remained dominant among scientists and doctors.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GISAID
GISAID is a global science initiative and primary source established in 2008 that provides open-access to genomic data of influenza viruses [3] and the coronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. [4] [5] On January 10, 2020, the first whole-genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 were made available on GISAID, which enabled global responses to the pandemic, [6] including the development of the first vaccines [7] and diagnostic tests [8] to detect SARS-CoV-2. GISAID facilitates genomic epidemiology and real-time surveillance to monitor the emergence of new COVID-19 viral strains across the planet. [6] [9]
Since its establishment as an alternative to sharing avian influenza data [10] via conventional public-domain archives, [3] [11] GISAID has been recognized for incentivizing rapid exchange of outbreak data [11] during the H1N1 pandemic [12] [13] in 2009, the H7N9 epidemic [14] [15] in 2013, and the COVID-19 pandemic [16] [17] in 2020.
GISAID was recognized for its importance to global health by G20 health ministers in 2017, [18] and in 2020 the World Health Organization chief scientist called the data-science initiative "a game changer". [4]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow_Coma_Scale
The Glasgow Coma Scale [1] ( GCS ) is a clinical scale used to reliably measure a person's level of consciousness after a brain injury .
The GCS assesses a person based on their ability to perform eye movements, speak, and move their body. These three behaviors make up the three elements of the scale: eye, verbal, and motor. A person's GCS score can range from 3 (completely unresponsive) to 15 (responsive). This score is used to guide immediate medical care after a brain injury (such as a car accident) and also to monitor hospitalized patients and track their level of consciousness.
Lower GCS scores are correlated with higher risk of death. However, the GCS score alone should not be used on its own to predict the outcome for an individual person with brain injury.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care
Health care , health-care , or healthcare is the maintenance or improvement of health via the prevention , diagnosis , treatment , recovery, or cure of disease , illness , injury , and other physical and mental impairments in people. Health care is delivered by health professionals and allied health fields . Medicine , dentistry , pharmacy , midwifery , nursing , optometry , audiology , psychology , occupational therapy , physical therapy , athletic training and other health professions are all part of health care. It includes work done in providing primary care , secondary care, and tertiary care , as well as in public health .
Access to health care may vary across countries, communities, and individuals, influenced by social and economic conditions as well as health policies . Providing health care services means "the timely use of personal health services to achieve the best possible health outcomes". [2] Factors to consider in terms of healthcare access include financial limitations (such as insurance coverage), geographic barriers (such as additional transportation costs, the possibility to take paid time off of work to use such services), and personal limitations (lack of ability to communicate with healthcare providers, poor health literacy, low income). [3] Limitations to health care services affects negatively the use of medical services, the efficacy of treatments, and overall outcome (well-being, mortality rates).
Health care systems are organizations established to meet the health needs of targeted populations. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), a well-functioning health care system requires a financing mechanism, a well-trained and adequately paid workforce , reliable information on which to base decisions and policies , and well maintained health facilities to deliver quality medicines and technologies.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_immunity
Herd immunity (also called herd effect , community immunity , population immunity , or mass immunity ) is a form of indirect protection from infectious disease that can occur with some diseases when a sufficient percentage of a population has become immune to an infection, whether through vaccination or previous infections, thereby reducing the likelihood of infection for individuals who lack immunity. [1] [2] [3] Immune individuals are unlikely to contribute to disease transmission , disrupting chains of infection, which stops or slows the spread of disease. [4] The greater the proportion of immune individuals in a community, the smaller the probability that non-immune individuals will come into contact with an infectious individual. [1]
Individuals can become immune by recovering from an earlier infection or through vaccination . [4] Some individuals cannot become immune because of medical conditions, such as an immunodeficiency or immunosuppression , and for this group herd immunity is a crucial method of protection. [5] [6] Once the herd immunity threshold has been reached, disease gradually disappears from a population. [6] This elimination, if achieved worldwide, may result in the permanent reduction in the number of infections to zero, called eradication . [7] Herd immunity created via vaccination contributed to the eventual eradication of smallpox in 1977 and has contributed to the reduction of other diseases. [8] Herd immunity applies only to contagious disease, meaning that it is transmitted from one individual to another. [6] Tetanus , for example, is infectious but not contagious, so herd immunity does not apply. [5]
Herd immunity was recognized as a naturally occurring phenomenon in the 1930s when it was observed that after a significant number of children had become immune to measles , the number of new infections temporarily decreased. [9] Mass vaccination to induce herd immunity has since become common and proved successful in preventing the spread of many infectious diseases. [10] Opposition to vaccination has posed a challenge to herd immunity, allowing preventable diseases to persist in or return to populations with inadequate vaccination rates. [11] [12] [13]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospice
Hospice care is a type of health care that focuses on the palliation of a terminally ill patient's pain and symptoms and attending to their emotional and spiritual needs at the end of life. Hospice care prioritizes comfort and quality of life by reducing pain and suffering. Hospice care provides an alternative to therapies focused on life-prolonging measures that may be arduous, likely to cause more symptoms, or are not aligned with a person's goals.
Hospice care in the United States is largely defined by the practices of the Medicare system and other health insurance providers, which cover inpatient or at home hospice care for patients with terminal diseases who are estimated to live six months or less. Hospice care under the Medicare Hospice Benefit requires documentation from two physicians estimating a person has less than six months to live if the disease follows its usual course. Hospice benefits include access to a multidisciplinary treatment team specialized in end of life care and can be accessed in the home, long term care facility or the hospital. [1]
Outside the United States, the term tends to be primarily associated with the particular buildings or institutions that specialize in such care. Such institutions may similarly provide care mostly in an end-of-life setting, but they may also be available for patients with other palliative care needs. Hospice care includes assistance for patients' families to help them cope with what is happening and provide care and support to keep the patient at home. [2]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_microbiome

The human microbiome is the aggregate of all microbiota that reside on or within human tissues and biofluids along with the corresponding anatomical sites in which they reside, [1] including the skin, mammary glands, seminal fluid, uterus, ovarian follicles, lung, saliva, oral mucosa , conjunctiva , biliary tract , and gastrointestinal tract . Types of human microbiota include bacteria , archaea , fungi , protists and viruses . Though micro-animals can also live on the human body, they are typically excluded from this definition. In the context of genomics , the term human microbiome is sometimes used to refer to the collective genomes of resident microorganisms; [2] however, the term human metagenome has the same meaning. [1]
Humans are colonized by many microorganisms, with approximately the same order of magnitude of non-human cells as human cells. [3] Some microorganisms that colonize humans are commensal , meaning they co-exist without harming humans; others have a mutualistic relationship with their human hosts. [2] : 700 [4] Conversely, some non- pathogenic microorganisms can harm human hosts via the metabolites they produce, like trimethylamine , which the human body converts to trimethylamine N-oxide via FMO3 -mediated oxidation. [5] [6] Certain microorganisms perform tasks that are known to be useful to the human host but the role of most of them is not well understood. Those that are expected to be present, and that under normal circumstances do not cause disease, are sometimes deemed normal flora or normal microbiota . [2]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrochloric_acid
Hydrochloric acid , also known as muriatic acid , is an aqueous solution of hydrogen chloride .  It is a colorless solution with a distinctive pungent smell. It is classified as a strong acid . It is a component of the gastric acid in the digestive systems of most animal species, including humans. Hydrochloric acid is an important laboratory reagent and industrial chemical. [7] [8]
In the early tenth century, the Persian physician and alchemist Abu Bakr al-Razi (854–925, Latin: Rhazes) conducted experiments with sal ammoniac ( ammonium chloride ) and vitriol (hydrated sulfates of various metals), which he distilled together, thus producing the gas hydrogen chloride. In doing so, al-Razi came very close to discovering hydrochloric acid, but it appears that he disregarded the gaseous products of his experiments, concentrating instead on the color changes that could be effected in the residue. [9] Drawing on al-Razi's experiments, the De aluminibus et salibus ("On Alums and Salts", an eleventh- or twelfth century Arabic text falsely attributed to al-Razi and translated into Latin in the second half of the twelfth century by Gerard of Cremona , 1144-1187) described the heating of metals with various salts, which in the case of mercury resulted in the production of mercury(II) chloride (corrosive sublimate). [10] In this process, hydrochloric acid actually started to form, but it immediately reacted with the mercury to produce corrosive sublimate. Thirteenth-century Latin alchemists, for whom the De aluminibus et salibus was one of the main reference works, were fascinated by the chlorinating properties of corrosive sublimate, and they soon discovered that when the metals are eliminated from the process of heating vitriols, alums , and salts, strong mineral acids can directly be distilled. [11] One important invention that resulted from the discovery of the mineral acids is aqua regia , a mixture of nitric acid and hydrochloric acid in a 1:3 proportion, capable of dissolving gold. This was first described in pseudo-Geber 's De inventione veritatis ("On the Discovery of Truth", after c. 1300), where aqua regia was prepared by adding ammonium chloride to nitric acid. [12] However, the production of hydrochloric acid itself (i.e., as an isolated substance rather than as already mixed with nitric acid) depended on the use of more efficient cooling apparatus, which would only develop in subsequent centuries. [13] Thus, recipes for the production of hydrochloric acid only appear in the late sixteenth century, the earliest being found in Giovanni Battista Della Porta 's (1535–1615) Magiae naturalis ("Natural Magic") and in the works of other contemporary chemists like Andreas Libavius (c. 1550–1616), Jean Beguin (1550–1620), and Oswald Croll (c. 1563– 1609). [14] The knowledge of mineral acids such as hydrochloric acid would be of key importance to seventeenth-century chemists like Daniel Sennert (1572–1637) and Robert Boyle (1627–1691), who used their capability to rapidly dissolve metals in their demonstrations of the composite nature of bodies. [15]
Because it was produced from rock salt according to the methods of Johann Rudolph Glauber , hydrochloric acid was historically called by European alchemists spirits of salt or acidum salis (salt acid). Both names are still used, especially in other languages, such as German : Salzsäure , Dutch : Zoutzuur , Swedish : Saltsyra , Spanish : Salfumán , Turkish : Tuz Ruhu , Polish : kwas solny and Czech : kyselina solná
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informed_consent
Informed consent is a process for getting permission before conducting a healthcare intervention on a person, for conducting some form of research on a person, or for disclosing a person's information. A health care provider may ask a patient to consent to receive therapy before providing it, a clinical researcher may ask a research participant before enrolling that person into a clinical trial , and a researcher may ask a research participant before starting some form of controlled experiment . Informed consent is collected according to guidelines from the fields of medical ethics and research ethics .
Free consent is a cognate term enshrined in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights . The Covenant was adopted in 1966 by the United Nations , and supposed to be in force by 23 March 1976. Article seven prohibits experiments conducted without the "free consent to medical or scientific experimentation" of the subject. [1] As of September 2019 [update] , the Covenant has 173 parties and six more signatories without ratification. [2]
An informed consent can be said to have been given based upon a clear appreciation and understanding of the facts, implications, and consequences of an action. To give informed consent, the individual concerned must have adequate reasoning faculties and be in possession of all relevant facts. Impairments to reasoning and judgment that may prevent informed consent include basic intellectual or emotional immaturity, high levels of stress such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or a severe intellectual disability , severe mental disorder , intoxication , severe sleep deprivation , Alzheimer's disease , or being in a coma .
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhaler
An inhaler (also known as a puffer , pump or allergy spray ) is a medical device used for delivering medicines into the lungs through the work of a person's breathing. This allows medicines to be delivered to and absorbed in the lungs, which provides the ability for targeted medical treatment to this specific region of the body, as well as a reduction in the side effects of oral medications. There are a wide variety of inhalers, and they are commonly used to treat numerous medical conditions with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) being among the most notable. [1]
Some of the common types of inhalers include meter-dosed inhalers , dry powder inhalers , soft mist inhalers, and nebulizers . Each device has advantages and disadvantages and can be selected based on specific patient needs, as well as age, coordination, and lung function. [2] Proper education on inhaler use is important to ensure that inhaled medication takes its proper effects in the lungs. [3]
Inhalers are designed to deliver medication directly to the lungs through a person's own breathing. This may benefit a patient by providing medicines directly to areas of disease, allowing medication to take a greater effect on its intended target, and limit side effects of medications due to localized treatment. [1] Inhalers are used in a variety of different medical conditions with diseases of the lungs and respiratory system being among the most common. These conditions utilize medications designed to decrease airway inflammation and obstruction to allow for easier and less strained breathing. [4] Antibiotic medications have even been developed for inhalers to allow for direct delivery to areas of infection within the lungs. [5] Two of the most common conditions that warrant inhaler therapy are asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . [4] [6]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interventional_Radiology
Interventional radiology ( IR ) is a medical subspecialty that performs various minimally-invasive procedures using medical imaging guidance, such as x-ray fluoroscopy , computed tomography , magnetic resonance imaging , or ultrasound . IR performs both diagnostic and therapeutic procedures through very small incisions or body orifices . Diagnostic IR procedures are those intended to help make a diagnosis or guide further medical treatment, and include image-guided biopsy of a tumor or injection of an imaging contrast agent into a hollow structure, such as a blood vessel or a duct . By contrast, therapeutic IR procedures provide direct treatment—they include catheter-based medicine delivery, medical device placement (e.g., stents), and angioplasty of narrowed structures.
The main benefits of interventional radiology techniques are that they can reach the deep structures of the body through a body orifice or tiny incision using small needles and wires . That decreases risks, pain, and recovery compared to open procedures . Real-time visualization also allows precision guidance to the abnormality, making the procedure or diagnosis more accurate.   These benefits are weighed against the additional risks of lack of immediate access to internal structures (should bleeding or a perforation occur), and the risks of radiation exposure such as cataracts and cancer.
Interventional radiology is a set of techniques that allows access to the internal structures of the body through body orifices or very small incisions and guidance with medical imaging .  Regardless of the reason for the intervention, the procedure will likely use common elements such as a puncture needle (to pass through the skin), guidewires (to guide through structures such as blood vessels or the biliary or urinary systems), a sheath (which slides over the guidewire and hold the path open without injuring it), and catheters (that allow fluids to be pushed through them). [1]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lancet

The Lancet is a weekly peer-reviewed general medical journal . It is among the world's oldest and best-known general medical journals. [1] [2] It was founded in 1823 by Thomas Wakley , an English surgeon who named it after the surgical instrument called a lancet (scalpel). [3]
The journal publishes original research articles, review articles ("seminars" and "reviews"), editorials , book reviews , correspondence, as well as news features and case reports . The Lancet has been owned by Elsevier since 1991, and its editor-in-chief since 1995 is Richard Horton . [4] The journal has editorial offices in London , New York , and Beijing .
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_therapy
Light therapy —or phototherapy , classically referred to as heliotherapy —consists either of exposure to daylight or some equivalent form of light as a treatment for seasonal affective disorder (SAD), or exposure of the skin to specific wavelengths of light using polychromatic polarised light to treat a skin condition.
It is used as a treatment for wintertime seasonal affective disorder and in circadian rhythm disorders , such as delayed sleep phase disorder . [1] There is tentative evidence to support its use to treat non-seasonal psychiatric disorders , in particular major depression and depression in bipolar disorder . [2] [3] [4]
As a treatment for disorders of the skin, the second kind of light therapy, called ultraviolet light therapy , is meant to correct psoriasis , acne vulgaris , eczema and neonatal jaundice . [5] [6]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liraglutide
Liraglutide , sold under the brand name Victoza among others, is a medication used to treat diabetes mellitus type 2 and obesity . [1] In diabetes it is a less preferred agent compared to metformin . [1] [2] Its effects on long-term health outcomes like heart disease and life expectancy are unclear. [1] [3] It is given by injection under the skin . [1]
Common side effects include low blood sugar , nausea, dizziness, abdominal pain, and pain at the site of injection. [1] Other serious side effects may include medullary thyroid cancer , angioedema , pancreatitis , gallbladder disease , and kidney problems . [1] Use in pregnancy and breastfeeding is of unclear safety. [1] Liraglutide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 receptor agonist) also known as incretin mimetics . [1] It works by increasing insulin release from the pancreas and decreases excessive glucagon release. [1]
Liraglutide was approved for medical use in the European Union in 2009, and in the United States in 2010. [4] [5] In 2018, it was the 143rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 4 million prescriptions. [6] [7]

0–9 A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
Abbreviations are used very frequently in medicine. They boost efficiency as long as they are used intelligently. The advantages of brevity should be weighed against the possibilities of obfuscation (making the communication harder for others to understand) and ambiguity (having more than one possible interpretation). Certain medical abbreviations are avoided to prevent mistakes, according to best practices (and in some cases regulatory requirements); these are flagged in the list of abbreviations used in medical prescriptions .
Periods (stops) are often used in styling abbreviations. Prevalent practice in medicine today is often to  forego them as unnecessary.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignant
Malignancy (from Latin male 'badly', and -gnus 'born') is the tendency of a medical condition to become progressively worse.
Malignancy is most familiar as a characterization of cancer . A malignant tumor contrasts with a non-cancerous benign tumor in that a malignancy is not self-limited in its growth, is capable of invading into adjacent tissues, and may be capable of spreading to distant tissues. A benign tumor has none of those properties.
Malignancy in cancers is characterized by anaplasia , invasiveness, and metastasis . [4] Malignant tumors are also characterized by genome instability , so that cancers, as assessed by whole genome sequencing , frequently have between 10,000 and 100,000 mutations in their entire genomes. [5] Cancers usually show tumour heterogeneity , containing multiple subclones. [6] They also frequently have reduced expression of DNA repair enzymes due to epigenetic methylation of DNA repair genes or altered microRNAs that control DNA repair gene expression.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis
Medical diagnosis (abbreviated Dx [1] or D S ) is the process of determining which disease or condition explains a person's symptoms and signs . It is most often referred to as diagnosis with the medical context being implicit. The information required for diagnosis is typically collected from a history and physical examination of the person seeking medical care. Often, one or more diagnostic procedures , such as medical tests , are also done during the process. Sometimes posthumous diagnosis is considered a kind of medical diagnosis.
Diagnosis is often challenging, because many signs and symptoms are nonspecific , and can only be undertaken by registered and licensed health professionals. For example, redness of the skin ( erythema ), by itself, is a sign of many disorders and thus does not tell the healthcare professional what is wrong. Thus differential diagnosis , in which several possible explanations are compared and contrasted, must be performed. This involves the correlation of various pieces of information followed by the recognition and differentiation of patterns. Occasionally the process is made easy by a sign or symptom (or a group of several) that is pathognomonic .
Diagnosis is a major component of the procedure of a doctor's visit . From the point of view of statistics , the diagnostic procedure involves classification tests .
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ethics
Medical ethics is an applied branch of ethics which analyzes the practice of clinical medicine and related scientific research. Medical ethics is based on a set of values that professionals can refer to in the case of any confusion or conflict. These values include the respect for autonomy , non-maleficence, beneficence , and justice . [1] Such tenets may allow doctors, care providers, and families to create a treatment plan and work towards the same common goal. [2] It is important to note that these four values are not ranked in order of importance or relevance and that they all encompass values pertaining to medical ethics. [3] However, a conflict may arise leading to the need for hierarchy in an ethical system, such that some moral elements overrule others with the purpose of applying the best moral judgement to a difficult medical situation. [4] Medical ethics is particularly relevant in decisions regarding involuntary treatment and involuntary commitment .
There are several codes of conduct. The Hippocratic Oath discusses basic principles for medical professionals. [4] This document dates back to the fifth century BCE. [5] Both The Declaration of Helsinki (1964) and The Nuremberg Code (1947) are two well-known and well respected documents contributing to medical ethics. Other important markings in the history of medical ethics include Roe v. Wade in 1973 and the development of hemodialysis in the 1960s. More recently, new techniques for gene editing aiming at treating, preventing and curing diseases utilizing gene editing, are raising important moral questions about their applications in medicine and treatments as well as societal impacts on future generations. [6]
As this field continues to develop and change throughout history, the focus remains on fair, balanced, and moral thinking across all cultural and religious backgrounds around the world. [7] [8] The field of medical ethics encompasses both practical application in clinical settings and scholarly work in philosophy , history , and sociology .
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Medical_Journal_of_Australia
The Medical Journal of Australia is a peer-reviewed medical journal published 22 times a year. It is the official journal of the Australian Medical Association , published by Wiley on behalf of the Australasian Medical Publishing Company.
The journal publishes editorials, original research, guideline summaries, narrative reviews, perspectives, medical education, reflections, and letters. [1] The full text of every issue since January 2002 is available online. [2]
The journal was established in 1856, when communication between Australian states and other English-speaking nations entailed long delays. [3] The journal was both a platform for Australian medical research, as well as educational reviews summarising research done overseas. It has since been renamed several times: [3] [4]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_microbiology
Medical microbiology , the large subset of microbiology that is applied to medicine , is a branch of medical science concerned with the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases .  In addition, this field of science studies various clinical applications of microbes for the improvement of health.  There are four kinds of microorganisms that cause infectious disease: bacteria , fungi , parasites and viruses , and one type of infectious protein called prion .
A medical microbiologist studies the characteristics of pathogens , their modes of transmission, mechanisms of infection and growth. The academic qualification as a clinical/Medical Microbiologist in a hospital or medical research centre generally requires a Masters in Microbiology along with Ph.D. in any of the life-sciences (Biochem, Micro, Biotech, Genetics, etc). [1] Using this information, a treatment can be devised.  Medical microbiologists often serve as consultants for physicians , providing identification of pathogens and suggesting treatment options.
Other tasks may include the identification of potential health risks to the community or monitoring the evolution of potentially virulent or resistant strains of microbes, educating the community and assisting in the design of health practices.  They may also assist in preventing or controlling epidemics and outbreaks of disease.
Not all medical microbiologists study microbial pathology ; some study common, non-pathogenic species to determine whether their properties can be used to develop antibiotics or other treatment methods.
Epidemiology , the study of the patterns, causes, and effects of health and disease conditions in populations, is an important part of medical microbiology, although the clinical aspect of the field primarily focuses on the presence and growth of microbial infections in individuals, their effects on the human body, and the methods of treating those infections. In this respect the entire field, as an applied science, can be conceptually subdivided into academic and clinical sub-specialties, although in reality there is a fluid continuum between public health microbiology and clinical microbiology , just as the state of the art in clinical laboratories depends on continual improvements in academic medicine and research laboratories .
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_Renaissance
The Medical Renaissance , from around 1400 to 1700 CE , was a period of progress in European medical knowledge, with renewed interest in the ideas of the ancient Greek and Roman civilizations along with Arabic-Persian medicine , following the translation into Latin of many works from these societies. Medical discoveries during the Medical Renaissance are credited with paving the way for modern medicine.
The Medical Renaissance began just as the original Renaissance did, in the early 16th century. Medical researchers continued their Renaissance-evoked practices into the late 17th century. [1] [2] Progress made during the Medical Renaissance depended on several factors. [3] [4] Printed books based on movable type , adopted in Europe from the middle of the 15th century, allowed the diffusion of medical ideas and anatomical diagrams. Linacre , Erasmus , Leonicello and Sylvius are among the list of the first scholars most credited for the starting of the Medical Renaissance. [2] Following after is Andreas Vesalius 's publication of De humani corporis fabrica (On the Fabric of the Human body) in 1543.  Better knowledge of the original writings of Galen in particular, developed into the learned medicine tradition through the more open attitudes of Renaissance humanism . Church control of the teachings of the medical profession and universities diminished, and dissection was more often possible.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_Subject_Headings
Medical Subject Headings ( MeSH ) is a comprehensive controlled vocabulary for the purpose of indexing journal articles and books in the life sciences . It serves as a thesaurus that facilitates searching. Created and updated by the United States National Library of Medicine (NLM), it is used by the MEDLINE / PubMed article database and by NLM's catalog of book holdings. MeSH is also used by ClinicalTrials.gov registry to classify which diseases are studied by trials registered in ClinicalTrials.
MeSH was introduced in the 1960s, with the NLM's own index catalogue and the subject headings of the Quarterly Cumulative Index Medicus (1940 edition) as precursors. The yearly printed version of MeSH was discontinued in 2007 and MeSH is now available online only. [2] It can be browsed and downloaded free of charge through PubMed. Originally in English, MeSH has been translated into numerous other languages and allows retrieval of documents from different origins.
MeSH vocabulary is divided into four types of terms. The main ones are the "headings" (also known as MeSH headings or descriptors [2] ), which describe the subject of each article (e.g., "Body Weight", "Brain Edema" or "Critical Care Nursing"). Most of these are accompanied by a short description or definition, links to related descriptors, and a list of synonyms or very similar terms (known as entry terms ). MeSH contains approximately 27,000 entries and is updated annually to reflect changes in medicine and medical terminology. [3] MeSH terms are arranged in alphabetic order and in a hierarchical structure by subject categories with more specific terms arranged beneath broader terms. When we search for a MeSH term, the most specific MeSH terms are automatically included in the search. This is known as the extended search or explode of that MeSH term. This additional information and the hierarchical structure (see below) make the MeSH essentially a thesaurus , rather than a plain subject headings list. [4]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_tourism
Medical tourism refers to people traveling abroad to obtain medical treatment. In the past, this usually referred to those who traveled from less-developed countries to major medical centers in highly developed countries for treatment unavailable at home. [1] [2] However, in recent years it may equally refer to those from developed countries who travel to developing countries for lower-priced medical treatments. The motivation may be also for medical services unavailable or non-licensed in the home country: There are differences between the medical agencies ( FDA , EMA etc.) world-wide, whether a drug is approved in their country or not. Even within Europe, although therapy protocols might be approved by the European Medical Agency (EMA), several countries have their own review organizations in order to evaluate whether the same therapy protocol would be "cost-effective", so that patients face differences in the therapy protocols, particularly in the access of these drugs, which might be partially explained by the financial strength of the particular Health System.
Medical tourism most often is for surgeries (cosmetic or otherwise) or similar treatments, though people also travel for dental tourism or fertility tourism . [3] People with rare conditions may travel to countries where the treatment is better understood. However, almost all types of health care are available, including psychiatry , alternative medicine, convalescent care, and even burial services.
Health tourism is a wider term for travel that focuses on medical treatments and the use of healthcare services. It covers a wide field of health-oriented tourism ranging from preventive and health-conductive treatment to rehabilitational and curative forms of travel. Wellness tourism is a related field.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MedlinePlus
MedlinePlus is an online information service produced by the United States National Library of Medicine . The service provides curated consumer health information in English and Spanish with select content in additional languages. [1] [2] The site brings together information from the National Library of Medicine (NLM), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), other U.S. government agencies, and health-related organizations.  There is also a site optimized for display on mobile devices, in both English and Spanish. In 2015, about 400 million people from around the world used MedlinePlus. [3] The service is funded by the NLM and is free to users.
MedlinePlus provides encyclopedic information on health and drug issues, and provides a directory of medical services. MedlinePlus Connect links patients or providers in electronic health record (EHR) systems to related MedlinePlus information on conditions or medications.
PubMed Health [4] is another NLM site that offers consumer health information, in addition to information for health professionals.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_capacity
Intelligence has been defined in many ways: the capacity for logic , understanding , self-awareness , learning , emotional knowledge , reasoning , planning , creativity , critical thinking , and problem-solving . More generally, it can be described as the ability to perceive or infer information , and to retain it as knowledge to be applied towards adaptive behaviors within an environment or context.
Intelligence is most often studied in humans but has also been observed in both non-human animals and in plants despite controversy as to whether some of these forms of life exhibit intelligence. [1] [2] Intelligence in computers or other machines is called artificial intelligence .
The word intelligence derives from the Latin nouns intelligentia or intellēctus , which in turn stem from the verb intelligere , to comprehend or perceive. In the Middle Ages , the word intellectus became the scholarly technical term for understanding, and a translation for the Greek philosophical term nous . This term, however, was strongly linked to the metaphysical and cosmological theories of teleological scholasticism , including theories of the immortality of the soul, and the concept of the active intellect (also known as the active intelligence). This approach to the study of nature was strongly rejected by the early modern philosophers such as Francis Bacon , Thomas Hobbes , John Locke , and David Hume , all of whom preferred "understanding" (in place of " intellectus " or "intelligence") in their English philosophical works. [3] [4] Hobbes for example, in his Latin De Corpore , used " intellectus intelligit ", translated in the English version as "the understanding understandeth", as a typical example of a logical absurdity . [5] "Intelligence" has therefore become less common in English language philosophy, but it has later been taken up (with the scholastic theories which it now implies) in more contemporary psychology . [6]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwife

A midwife is a health professional who cares for mothers and newborns around childbirth , a specialization known as midwifery .
The education and training for a midwife concentrates extensively on the care of women throughout their lifespan; concentrating on being experts in what is normal and identifying conditions that need further evaluation. In most countries, midwives are recognized as skilled healthcare providers. Midwives are trained to recognize variations from the normal progress of labor and understand how to deal with deviations from normal. They may intervene in high risk situations such as breech births , twin births , and births where the baby is in a posterior position , using non-invasive techniques. For complications related to pregnancy and birth that are beyond the midwife's scope of practice , including surgical and instrumental deliveries, they refer their patients to physicians or surgeons. [3] [4] In many parts of the world, these professions work in tandem to provide care to childbearing women. In others, only the midwife is available to provide care, and in yet other countries, many women elect to utilize obstetricians primarily over midwives.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_Army_Surgical_Hospital
The Mobile Army Surgical Hospital ( MASH ) refers to a United States Army medical unit serving as a fully functional hospital in a combat area of operations.  The units were first established in August 1945, and were deployed during the Korean War and later conflicts. The term was made famous in the novel, movie, and television series M*A*S*H , which depicted a fictional MASH unit. The U.S. Army deactivated the last MASH unit on February 16, 2006. The successor to the Mobile Army Surgical Hospital is the Combat Support Hospital .
A precursor to MASH units, the American Expeditionary Force Mobile Hospital No.1 was established following the example of the French military automobile-chirurgical units shortly after the American entry to the war. [1]
Principles for a mobile medical unit and their implementation were established through trial and error in the dental field during World War II by Major Vincent P. Marran, medic in Patton's Third Army. [2] The effectiveness of his efforts were widely admired and supported by the command structure, but no formal designation was established.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgue
A morgue or mortuary (in a hospital or elsewhere) is a place used for the storage of human corpses awaiting identification or removal for autopsy or respectful burial , cremation or other method. In modern times, corpses have customarily been refrigerated to delay decomposition . [1]
The term mortuary dates from the early 14th century, from Anglo-French mortuarie , meaning "gift to a parish priest from a deceased parishioner," from Medieval Latin mortuarium, noun use of neuter of Late Latin adjective mortuarius "pertaining to the dead," from Latin mortuus , pp. of mori "to die" (see mortal (adj.)). The meaning of "place where bodies are kept temporarily" was first recorded in 1865, as a euphemism for the earlier English term "deadhouse."
The term morgue comes from the French morgue , which means 'to look at solemnly, to defy'. First used to describe the inner wicket of a prison , where new prisoners were kept so that jailers and turnkeys could recognize them in the future, it took on its modern meaning in fifteenth-century Paris , being used to describe part of the Châtelet used for the storage and identification of unknown corpses.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturopathy


Naturopathy or naturopathic medicine is a form of alternative medicine that employs an array of pseudoscientific practices branded as "natural", "non-invasive", or promoting "self-healing". The ideology and methods of naturopathy are based on vitalism and folk medicine , rather than evidence-based medicine (EBM). [2] Naturopathic practitioners generally recommend against following modern medical practices , including but not limited to medical testing , drugs , vaccinations , and surgery . [3] [4] [5] [6] Instead, naturopathic practice relies on unscientific notions, often leading naturopaths to diagnoses and treatments that have no factual merit. [7] [8]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_pharmacy
An online pharmacy , internet pharmacy , or mail-order pharmacy is a pharmacy that operates over the Internet and sends orders to customers through mail, shipping companies, or online pharmacy web portal.
Online pharmacies include:
Conventional 'bricks and mortar' pharmacies usually have controlled drug distribution systems from the manufacturer, sufficient validation , and follow good distribution practices. Home delivery of pharmaceuticals can be a desirable convenience, but sometimes it can lead to problems with uncontrolled distribution.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid_crisis

The Opioid epidemic , also referred to as the opioid crisis , is the phrase used to describe the overuse, misuse/abuse, and overdose deaths, attributed either in part or in whole, by the class of drugs opiates/ opioids , and the significant medical, social, psychological, and economic consequences of both the medical and the non-medical or recreational use of these medications.
Opioids are a diverse class of moderate to strong painkillers , including oxycodone (commonly sold under the trade names OxyContin and Percocet ), hydrocodone ( Vicodin , Norco ) and a very strong painkiller, fentanyl , which is synthesized to resemble other opiates such as opium -derived morphine and heroin . [1] The potency and availability of these substances, despite the potential risk of addiction and overdose, have made them popular both as medical treatments and as recreational drugs . Due to their sedative effects on the part of the brain which regulates breathing, the respiratory center of the medulla oblongata , opioids in high doses present the potential for respiratory depression and may cause respiratory failure and death . [2]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_concentrator
An oxygen concentrator is a device that concentrates the oxygen from a gas supply (typically ambient air) by selectively removing nitrogen to supply an oxygen-enriched product gas stream.
Two methods in common use are pressure swing adsorption and membrane gas separation .
Home medical oxygen concentrators were invented in the early 1970s, with the manufacturing output of these devices increasing in the late 1970s. Union Carbide Corporation and Bendix Corporation were both early manufacturers. Before that era, home medical oxygen therapy required the use of heavy high-pressure oxygen cylinders or small cryogenic liquid oxygen systems. Both of these delivery systems required frequent home visits by suppliers to replenish oxygen supplies. In the United States, Medicare switched from fee-for-service payment to a flat monthly rate for home oxygen therapy in the mid-1980s, causing the durable medical equipment (DME) industry to rapidly embrace concentrators as a way to control costs. This reimbursement change dramatically decreased the number of primary high pressure and liquid oxygen delivery systems in use in homes in the United States at that time. Oxygen concentrators became the preferred and most common means of delivering home oxygen. The number of manufacturers entering the oxygen concentrator market increased exponentially as a result of this change. Union Carbide Corporation invented the molecular sieve in the 1950s which made these devices possible.  It also invented the first cryogenic liquid home medical oxygen systems in the 1960s.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_therapy
Oxygen therapy , also known as supplemental oxygen , is the use of oxygen as a medical treatment . [1] This can include for low blood oxygen , carbon monoxide toxicity , cluster headaches , and to maintain enough oxygen while inhaled anesthetics are given. [2] Long-term oxygen is often useful in people with chronically low oxygen such as from severe COPD or cystic fibrosis . [3] [1] Oxygen can be given in a number of ways including nasal cannula , face mask , and inside a hyperbaric chamber . [4] [5]
Oxygen is required for normal cell metabolism . [6] Excessively high concentrations can cause oxygen toxicity such as lung damage or result in respiratory failure in those who are predisposed. [2] [7] Higher oxygen concentrations also increase the risk of fires, particularly while smoking, and without humidification can also dry out the nose. [1] The target oxygen saturation recommended depends on the condition being treated. [1] In most conditions a saturation of 94–96% is recommended, while in those at risk of carbon dioxide retention saturations of 88–92% are preferred, and in those with carbon monoxide toxicity or cardiac arrest they should be as high as possible. [1] [8] Air is typically 21% oxygen by volume while oxygen therapy increases this by some amount up to 100%. [7]
The use of oxygen in medicine became common around 1917. [9] [10] It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines . [11] The cost of home oxygen is about US$150 a month in Brazil and US$400 a month in the United States. [3] Home oxygen can be provided either by oxygen tanks or an oxygen concentrator . [1] Oxygen is believed to be the most common treatment given in hospitals in the developed world . [12] [1]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient
A patient is any recipient of health care services that are performed by healthcare professionals . The patient is most often ill or injured and in need of treatment by a physician , nurse , psychologist , dentist , veterinarian , or other health care provider .
The word patient originally meant 'one who suffers'. This English noun comes from the Latin word patiens , the present participle of the deponent verb , patior , meaning 'I am suffering,' and akin to the Greek verb πάσχειν (= paskhein , to suffer) and its cognate noun πάθος (= pathos ).

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nerve_block
Nerve block or regional nerve blockade is any deliberate interruption of signals traveling along a nerve, often for the purpose of pain relief. Local anesthetic nerve block (sometimes referred to as simply "nerve block") is a short-term block, usually lasting hours or days, involving the injection of an anesthetic, a corticosteroid , and other agents onto or near a nerve. Neurolytic block , the deliberate temporary degeneration of nerve fibers through the application of chemicals, heat, or freezing, produces a block that may persist for weeks, months, or indefinitely. Neurectomy , the cutting through or removal of a nerve or a section of a nerve, usually produces a permanent block. Because neurectomy of a sensory nerve is often followed, months later, by the emergence of new, more intense pain, sensory nerve neurectomy is rarely performed.
The concept of nerve block sometimes includes central nerve block , which includes epidural and spinal anaesthesia . [1]
Local anesthetic is often combined with other drugs to potentiate or prolong the analgesia produced by the nerve block. These adjuvants may include epinephrine , corticosteroids , opioids , ketamine , or alpha-adrenergic agonists . These blocks can be either single treatments, multiple injections over a period of time, or continuous infusions. A continuous peripheral nerve block can be introduced into a limb undergoing surgery – for example, a femoral nerve block to prevent pain in knee replacement . [2]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacy
Pharmacy is the clinical health science that links medical science with chemistry and it is charged with the discovery, production, disposal, safe and effective use, and control of medications and drugs . The practice of pharmacy requires excellent knowledge of drugs, their mechanism of action , side effects , interactions, mobility and toxicity . At the same time, it requires knowledge of treatment and understanding of the pathological process. Some specialties of pharmacists, such as that of clinical pharmacists , require other skills, e.g. knowledge about the acquisition and evaluation of physical and laboratory data. [1]
The scope of pharmacy practice includes more traditional roles such as compounding and dispensing of medications, and it also includes more modern services related to health care , including clinical services, reviewing medications for safety and efficacy, and providing drug information. Pharmacists , therefore, are the experts on drug therapy and are the primary health professionals who optimize the use of medication for the benefit of the patients.
An establishment in which pharmacy (in the first sense) is practiced is called a pharmacy (this term is more common in the United States) or a chemist's (which is more common in Great Britain, though pharmacy is also used) [ citation needed ] . In the United States and Canada, drugstores commonly sell medicines , as well as miscellaneous items such as confectionery , cosmetics , office supplies , toys , hair care products and magazines and occasionally refreshments and groceries.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_dependence
Physical dependence is a physical condition caused by chronic use of a tolerance -forming drug, in which abrupt or gradual drug withdrawal causes unpleasant physical symptoms. [5] [6] Physical dependence can develop from low-dose therapeutic use of certain medications such as benzodiazepines, opioids, antiepileptics and antidepressants, as well as the recreational misuse of drugs such as alcohol, opioids and benzodiazepines. The higher the dose used, the greater the duration of use, and the earlier age use began are predictive of worsened physical dependence and thus more severe withdrawal syndromes. Acute withdrawal syndromes can last days, weeks or months. Protracted withdrawal syndrome, also known as post-acute-withdrawal syndrome or "PAWS", is a low-grade continuation of some of the symptoms of acute withdrawal, typically in a remitting-relapsing pattern, often resulting in relapse and prolonged disability of a degree to preclude the possibility of lawful employment. Protracted withdrawal syndrome can last for months, years, or depending on individual factors, indefinitely. Protracted withdrawal syndrome is noted to be most often caused by benzodiazepines . [7] To dispel the popular misassociation with addiction, physical dependence to medications is sometimes compared to dependence on insulin by persons with diabetes. [8]
Physical dependence can manifest itself in the appearance of both physical and psychological symptoms which are caused by physiological adaptions in the central nervous system and the brain due to chronic exposure to a substance. Symptoms which may be experienced during withdrawal or reduction in dosage include increased heart rate and/or blood pressure, sweating, and tremors. [9] More serious withdrawal symptoms such as confusion , seizures , and visual hallucinations indicate a serious emergency and the need for immediate medical care. Sedative hypnotic drugs such as alcohol , benzodiazepines , and barbiturates are the only commonly available substances that can be fatal in withdrawal due to their propensity to induce withdrawal convulsions. Abrupt withdrawal from other drugs, such as opioids can cause an extremely painful withdrawal that is very rarely fatal in patients of general good health and with medical treatment, but is more often fatal in patients with weakened cardiovascular systems; toxicity is generally caused by the often-extreme increases in heart rate and blood pressure (which can be treated with clonidine ), or due to arrhythmia due to electrolyte imbalance caused by the inability to eat, and constant diarrhea and vomiting (which can be treated with loperamide and ondansetron respectively) associated with acute opioid withdrawal, especially in longer-acting substances where the diarrhea and emesis can continue unabated for weeks, although life-threatening complications are extremely rare, and nearly non-existent with proper medical management.
Treatment for physical dependence depends upon the drug being withdrawn and often includes administration of another drug, especially for substances that can be dangerous when abruptly discontinued or when previous attempts have failed. [10] Physical dependence is usually managed by a slow dose reduction over a period of weeks, months or sometimes longer depending on the drug, dose and the individual. [7] A physical dependence on alcohol is often managed with a cross tolerant drug, such as long acting benzodiazepines to manage the alcohol withdrawal symptoms.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiotherapy

Physical therapy ( PT ), also known as physiotherapy , is one of the healthcare professions .  Physical therapy is provided by physical therapists who promote, maintain, or restore health through physical examination , diagnosis , prognosis, patient education , physical intervention, rehabilitation, disease prevention and health promotion . Physical therapists are known as physiotherapists in many countries.
In addition to clinical practice, other aspects of physical therapist practice include research, education, consultation and health administration . Physical therapy is provided as a primary care treatment or alongside, or in conjunction with, other medical services. In some jurisdictions, such as the United Kingdom, physical therapists have the authority to prescribe medication. [1]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plague_doctor
A Plague doctor was a physician who treated victims of the bubonic plague [1] during epidemics . These physicians were hired by cities to treat infected patients regardless of income, especially the poor that could not afford to pay. [2] Plague doctors are often depicted in Halloween costumes and seen as a symbol of death and disease. [3]
Plague doctors had a mixed reputation, with some citizens seeing their presence as a warning to leave the area. [4] Some plague doctors were said to charge patients and their families additional fees for special treatments or false cures. [5] In many cases these "doctors" were not experienced physicians or surgeons ; instead, being volunteers, second-rate doctors, or young doctors just starting a career. [6] In one case, a plague doctor was a fruit salesman before his employment as a physician. Plague doctors rarely cured patients; instead serving to record death tolls and the number of infected people for demographic purposes. [4]
In France and the Netherlands , plague doctors often lacked medical training and were referred to as " empirics ." Plague doctors were known as municipal or "community plague doctors", whereas "general practitioners" were separate doctors and both might be in the same European city or town at the same time. [1] [7] [8] [9]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plumpy%27nut
Plumpy'Nut is a peanut -based paste in a plastic wrapper for treatment of severe acute malnutrition manufactured by Nutriset , a French company. [2] [3] Removing the need for hospitalization, the 92-gram (3¼ oz) packets of this paste can be administered at home and allow larger numbers to be treated. [2]
Plumpy'Nut may be referred to in scientific literature as a Ready-to-Use Therapeutic Food (RUTF) alongside other RUTFs such as BP100. [4]
Nutriset has been criticized by Médecins Sans Frontières for enforcing its Plumpy'nut patents. [5]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenatal_diagnosis
Prenatal testing consists of prenatal screening and prenatal diagnosis , which are aspects of prenatal care that focus on detecting problems with the pregnancy as early as possible. [1] These may be anatomic and physiologic problems with the health of the zygote , embryo , or fetus , either before gestation even starts (as in preimplantation genetic diagnosis ) or as early in gestation as practicable. Screening can detect problems such as neural tube defects , chromosome abnormalities, and gene mutations that would lead to genetic disorders and birth defects , such as spina bifida , cleft palate , Downs Syndrome , Tay–Sachs disease , sickle cell anemia , thalassemia , cystic fibrosis , muscular dystrophy , and fragile X syndrome . Some tests are designed to discover problems which primarily affect the health of the mother, such as PAPP-A to detect pre-eclampsia or glucose tolerance tests to diagnose gestational diabetes . Screening can also detect anatomical defects such as hydrocephalus , anencephaly , heart defects , and amniotic band syndrome .
Prenatal screening focuses on finding problems among a large population with affordable and noninvasive methods. Prenatal diagnosis focuses on pursuing additional detailed information once a particular problem has been found, and can sometimes be more invasive. The most common screening procedures are routine ultrasounds , blood tests, and blood pressure measurement. Common diagnosis procedures include amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling . In some cases, the tests are administered to determine if the foetus will be aborted , though physicians and patients also find it useful to diagnose high-risk pregnancies early so that delivery can be scheduled in a tertiary care hospital where the baby can receive appropriate care.
There are three purposes of prenatal diagnosis: (1) to enable timely medical or surgical treatment of a condition before or after birth, (2) to give the parents the chance to abort a fetus with the diagnosed condition, and (3) to give parents the chance to prepare psychologically, socially, financially, and medically for a baby with a health problem or disability, or for the likelihood of a stillbirth. Prior information about problems in pregnancy means that healthcare staff as well as parents can better prepare themselves for the delivery of a child with a health problem. For example, Down Syndrome is associated with cardiac defects that may need intervention immediately upon birth. [2]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis
Prognosis ( Greek : πρόγνωσις "fore-knowing, foreseeing") is a medical term for predicting the likely or expected development of a disease, including whether the signs and symptoms will improve or worsen (and how quickly) or remain stable over time; expectations of quality of life, such as the ability to carry out daily activities; the potential for complications and associated health issues; and the likelihood of survival (including life expectancy). [1] [2] A prognosis is made on the basis of the normal course of the diagnosed disease, the individual's physical and mental condition, the available treatments, and additional factors. [2] A complete prognosis includes the expected duration, function, and description of the course of the disease, such as progressive decline, intermittent crisis, or sudden, unpredictable crisis.
When applied to large statistical populations , prognostic estimates can be very accurate: for example the statement "45% of patients with severe septic shock will die within 28 days" can be made with some confidence, because previous research found that this proportion of patients died. This statistical information does not apply to the prognosis for each individual patient, because patient-specific factors can substantially change the expected course of the disease: additional information is needed to determine whether a patient belongs to the 45% who will die, or to the 55% who survive. [3]
Prognostic scoring is also used for cancer outcome predictions. A Manchester score is an indicator of prognosis for small-cell lung cancer . For Non-Hodgkin lymphoma , physicians have developed the International Prognostic Index to predict patient outcome.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis
Preventive healthcare , or prophylaxis , consists of measures taken for disease prevention. [1] Disease and disability are affected by environmental factors , genetic predisposition , disease agents, and lifestyle choices and are dynamic processes which begin before individuals realize they are affected. Disease prevention relies on anticipatory actions that can be categorized as primal, [2] [3] primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention. [1]
Each year, millions of people die of preventable deaths. A 2004 study showed that about half of all deaths in the United States in 2000 were due to preventable behaviors and exposures. [4] Leading causes included cardiovascular disease , chronic respiratory disease , unintentional injuries, diabetes , and certain infectious diseases. [4] This same study estimates that 400,000 people die each year in the United States due to poor diet and a sedentary lifestyle . [4] According to estimates made by the World Health Organization (WHO), about 55 million people died worldwide in 2011, two thirds of this group from non-communicable diseases, including cancer , diabetes , and chronic cardiovascular and lung diseases . [5] This is an increase from the year 2000, during which 60% of deaths were attributed to these diseases. [5] Preventive healthcare is especially important given the worldwide rise in prevalence of chronic diseases and deaths from these diseases.
There are many methods for prevention of disease. One of them is prevention of teenage smoking through information giving. [6] [7] [8] [9] It is recommended that adults and children aim to visit their doctor for regular check-ups, even if they feel healthy, to perform disease screening , identify risk factors for disease, discuss tips for a healthy and balanced lifestyle, stay up to date with immunizations and boosters, and maintain a good relationship with a healthcare provider. [10] In pediatrics, some common examples of primary prevention are encouraging parents to turn down the temperature of their home water heater in order to avoid scalding burns, encouraging children to wear bicycle helmets, and suggesting that people use the Air Quality Index (AQI) to check the level of pollution in the outside air before engaging in sporting activities.  Some common disease screenings include checking for hypertension (high blood pressure), hyperglycemia (high blood sugar, a risk factor for diabetes mellitus ), hypercholesterolemia (high blood cholesterol), screening for colon cancer , depression , HIV and other common types of sexually transmitted disease such as chlamydia , syphilis , and gonorrhea , mammography (to screen for breast cancer ), colorectal cancer screening, a Pap test (to check for cervical cancer ), and screening for osteoporosis . Genetic testing can also be performed to screen for mutations that cause genetic disorders or predisposition to certain diseases such as breast or ovarian cancer . [10] However, these measures are not affordable for every individual and the cost effectiveness of preventive healthcare is still a topic of debate. [11] [12]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoallergy
A pseudoallergy is a condition named for its similar presentation to a true allergy , though due to different causes. [1]
It may be due to alterations in the metabolism of histamine . [2]
It can be the cause of some forms of food intolerance . [3]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopathology
Psychopathology is the study of abnormal cognitions, behaviour and experiences which differs according to social norms and rests upon a number of constructs that are deemed to be the social norm at any particular era. It can be broadly separated into descriptive and explanatory. [1] Descriptive psychopathology involves categorizing, defining and understanding symptoms as reported by people and observed through their behavior which are then assessed according to a social norm. [1] Explanatory psychopathology looks to find explanations for certain kinds of symptoms according to theoretical models such as psychodynamics , cognitive behavioral therapy or through understanding how they have been constructed by drawing upon Constructivist Grounded Theory (Charmaz, 2016) or Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (Smith, Flowers & Larkin, 2013). [1] A practitioner in a clinical or academic field is referred to as a psychopathologist .
Biological psychopathology is the study of the biological etiology of abnormal cognitions, behavior and experiences. Child psychopathology is a specialization applied to children and adolescents. Animal psychopathology is a specialization applied to non-human animals. This concept is linked to the philosophical ideas first outlined by Galton (1869) and is linked to the appliance of eugenical ideations around what constitutes the human.
Early explanations for mental illnesses were influenced by religious belief and superstition . Psychological conditions that are now classified as mental disorders were initially attributed to possessions by evil spirits, demons, and the devil. This idea was widely accepted up until the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Individuals who suffered from these so-called "possessions" were tortured as treatment or as Foucault outlines in the History of Madness: viewed as seers (Joan of Arc). [ citation needed ] Religious practitioners used this technique in hoping to bring their patients back to sanity but increasingly there was the shift to the great confinement.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health

Public health has been defined as "the science and art of preventing disease ”, prolonging life and improving quality of life through organized efforts and informed choices of society , organizations (public and private), communities and individuals . [1] Analyzing the determinants of health of a population and the threats it faces is the basis for public health. [2] The public can be as small as a handful of people or as large as a village or an entire city; in the case of a pandemic it may encompass several continents. The concept of health takes into account physical, psychological , and social well-being . As such, according to the World Health Organization , it is not merely the absence of disease or infirmity and more recently, a resource for everyday living. [3]
Public health is an interdisciplinary field. For example, epidemiology , biostatistics , social sciences and management of health services are all relevant. Other important sub-fields include environmental health , community health , behavioral health , health economics , public policy , mental health , health education , health politics , occupational safety , disability , gender issues in health, and sexual and reproductive health . [4] Public health, together with primary care , secondary care, and tertiary care , is part of a country's overall health care system. Many interventions of public health interest are delivered outside of health facilities , such as food safety surveillance, distribution of condoms and needle-exchange programs for the prevention of transmissible diseases. Public health is not the same as public healthcare ( publicly funded health care ).
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed

PubMed is a free search engine accessing primarily the MEDLINE database of references and abstracts on life sciences and biomedical topics. The United States National Library of Medicine (NLM) at the National Institutes of Health maintain the database as part of the Entrez system of information retrieval . [1]
From 1971 to 1997, online access to the MEDLINE database had been primarily through institutional facilities, such as university libraries . [2] PubMed, first released in January 1996, ushered in the era of private, free, home- and office-based MEDLINE searching. [3] The PubMed system was offered free to the public starting in June 1997. [2]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial
A randomized controlled trial (or randomized control trial ; [2] RCT ) is a type of scientific experiment (e.g. a clinical trial ) or intervention study (as opposed to observational study ) that aims to reduce certain sources of bias when testing the effectiveness of new treatments; this is accomplished by randomly allocating subjects to two or more groups, treating them differently, and then comparing them with respect to a measured response. One group—the experimental group—receives the intervention being assessed, while the other—usually called the control group—receives an alternative treatment, such as a placebo or no intervention. The groups are monitored under conditions of the trial design to determine the effectiveness of the experimental intervention, and efficacy is assessed in comparison to the control. [3] There may be more than one treatment group or more than one control group .
The trial may be blinded , meaning that information which may influence the participants is withheld until after the experiment is complete. A blind can be imposed on any participant of an experiment, including subjects, researchers, technicians, data analysts, and evaluators. Effective blinding may reduce or eliminate some sources of experimental bias .
The randomness in the assignment of subjects to groups reduces selection bias and allocation bias, balancing both known and unknown prognostic factors, in the assignment of treatments. [4] Blinding reduces other forms of experimenter and subject biases .
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction_Agostini
Reaction Agostini is the name of a simplified examination for the presence of glucose in human urine.
The method consists of preparing a solution of sodium chloride and potassium oxide , adding the urine to be investigated. If there is glucose present, the solution becomes red. [1]

The Royal College of Physicians (RCP) is a British professional membership body dedicated to improving the practice of medicine, chiefly through the accreditation of physicians by examination. Founded by royal charter from King Henry VIII in 1518, the RCP is the oldest medical college in England. It set the first international standard in the classification of diseases, and its library contains medical texts of great historical interest. The college is sometimes referred to as the Royal College of Physicians of London to differentiate it from other similarly named bodies.
The RCP drives improvements in health and healthcare through advocacy, education and research. Its 40,000 members work in hospitals and communities across over 30 medical specialties with around a fifth based in over 80 countries worldwide.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_(medicine)

Saline (also known as saline solution ) is a mixture of sodium chloride in water and has a number of uses in medicine. [1] Applied to the affected area it is used to clean wounds, help remove contact lenses , and help with dry eyes . [2] By injection into a vein it is used to treat dehydration such as from gastroenteritis and diabetic ketoacidosis . [2] [1]
Large amounts may result in fluid overload , swelling , acidosis , and high blood sodium . [1] [2] In those with long-standing low blood sodium , excessive use may result in osmotic demyelination syndrome . [2] Saline is in the crystalloid family of medications. [3] It is most commonly used as a sterile 9 g of salt per litre (0.9%) solution, known as normal saline. [1] Higher and lower concentrations may also occasionally be used. [4] [5] Saline is acidic, with a pH of 5.5 (due mainly to dissolved carbon dioxide). [6]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septic_shock
Septic shock is a potentially fatal medical condition that occurs when sepsis , which is organ injury or damage in response to infection , leads to dangerously low blood pressure and abnormalities in cellular metabolism. The Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3) defines septic shock as a subset of sepsis in which particularly profound circulatory, cellular, and metabolic abnormalities are associated with a greater risk of mortality than with sepsis alone. Patients with septic shock can be clinically identified by requiring  a vasopressor to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 65 mm Hg or greater and having serum lactate level greater than 2 mmol/L (>18 mg/dL) in the absence of hypovolemia . This combination is associated with hospital mortality rates greater than 40%. [1]
The primary infection is most commonly caused by bacteria , but also may be by fungi , viruses or parasites . It may be located in any part of the body, but most commonly in the lungs, brain, urinary tract , skin or abdominal organs . [2] It can cause multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (formerly known as multiple organ failure) and death . [3]
Frequently, people with septic shock are cared for in intensive care units . It most commonly affects children, immunocompromised individuals, and the elderly, as their immune systems cannot deal with infection as effectively as those of healthy adults. The mortality rate from septic shock is approximately 25–50%. [3]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_distancing

In public health, social distancing , also called physical distancing , [2] [3] [4] is a set of non-pharmaceutical interventions or measures intended to prevent the spread of a contagious disease by maintaining a physical distance between people and reducing the number of times people come into close contact with each other. [2] [5] It usually involves keeping a certain distance from others (the distance specified differs from country to country and can change with time) and avoiding gathering together in large groups. [6] [7]
By minimising the probability that a given uninfected person will come into physical contact with an infected person, the disease transmission can be suppressed, resulting in fewer deaths . [2] The measures may be used in combination with others, such as good respiratory hygiene , face masks and hand washing . [8] [9] To slow down the spread of infectious diseases and avoid overburdening healthcare systems, particularly during a pandemic , several social-distancing measures are used, including the closing of schools and workplaces, isolation , quarantine , restricting the movement of people and the cancellation of mass gatherings . [5] [10] Drawbacks of social distancing can include loneliness , reduced productivity and the loss of other benefits associated with human interaction . [11]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_index
The therapeutic index ( TI ; also referred to as therapeutic ratio ) is a quantitative measurement of the relative safety of a drug.  It is a comparison of the amount of a therapeutic agent that causes the therapeutic effect to the amount that causes toxicity. [1] The related terms therapeutic window or safety window refer to a range of doses which optimize between efficacy and toxicity, achieving the greatest therapeutic benefit without resulting in unacceptable side-effects or toxicity.
Classically, in an established clinical indication setting of an approved drug, TI refers to the ratio of the dose of drug that causes adverse effects at an incidence/severity not compatible with the targeted indication (e.g. toxic dose in 50% of subjects, TD 50 ) to the dose that leads to the desired pharmacological effect (e.g. efficacious dose in 50% of subjects, ED 50 ). In contrast, in a drug development setting TI is calculated based on plasma exposure levels. [2]
In the early days of pharmaceutical toxicology, TI was frequently determined in animals as lethal dose of a drug for 50% of the population ( LD 50 ) divided by the minimum effective dose for 50% of the population ( ED 50 ). Today, more sophisticated toxicity endpoints are used.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy
A therapy or medical treatment (often abbreviated tx , Tx , or T x ) is the attempted remediation of a health problem, usually following a medical diagnosis .
As a rule, each therapy has indications and contraindications .  There are many different types of therapy.  Not all therapies are effective .  Many therapies can produce unwanted adverse effects .
Treatment and therapy are generally considered synonyms.  However,  in the context of mental health , the term therapy may refer specifically to psychotherapy .
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_medicine

Traditional Chinese medicine ( TCM ) is a branch of traditional medicine in China. It has been described as "fraught with pseudoscience ", and the majority of its treatments as having no logical mechanism of action . [1]
TCM is said to be based on Compendium of Materia Medica and Huangdi Neijing . The practice includes various forms of herbal medicine , acupuncture , cupping therapy , gua sha , massage (tui na) , bonesetter (die-da) , exercise (qigong) , and dietary therapy. [2] TCM is widely used in the Sinosphere , [2] [3] [4] [5] where it has a long history; subsequently it is now also practiced outside of China. [2] [6] One of the basic tenets of TCM is that the body's vital energy ( ch'i or qi ) is circulating through channels called meridians having branches connected to bodily organs and functions. [7] The concept of vital energy is pseudoscientific. Concepts of the body and of disease used in TCM reflect its ancient origins and its emphasis on dynamic processes over material structure, similar to the humoral theory of Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome . [8] The use of traditional medicine in China has been a major generator of illegal wildlife smuggling , linked to the killing and smuggling of endangered animals and the primary consumer of the illegal ivory trade . The trade being a major factor for endangering species leading to extinction of biodiversity collapse in many places of the world. [9]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_medicine
Traditional medicine (also known as indigenous or folk medicine ) comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within the folk beliefs of various societies before the era of modern medicine . The World Health Organization (WHO) defines traditional medicine as "the sum total of the knowledge, skills, and practices based on the theories, beliefs, and experiences indigenous to different cultures, whether explicable or not, used in the maintenance of health as well as in the prevention, diagnosis, improvement or treatment of physical and mental illness". [1] Traditional medicine is contrasted with scientific medicine .
In some Asian and African countries, up to 80% of the population relies on traditional medicine for their primary health care needs.  When adopted outside its traditional culture, traditional medicine is often considered a form of alternative medicine . [1] Practices known as traditional medicines include traditional European medicine, traditional Chinese medicine , traditional indigenous Mayongia magic and medicine(Assam), traditional indigenous medicine of Assam and rest of NE India, nattuvaidyam (indigenous medicine practised in south India), traditional Korean medicine , traditional African medicine , Ayurveda , Siddha medicine , Unani , ancient Iranian Medicine , Iranian (Persian) , Islamic medicine , Muti , and Ifá . Scientific disciplines which study traditional medicine include herbalism , ethnomedicine , ethnobotany , and medical anthropology .
The WHO notes, however, that "inappropriate use of traditional medicines or practices can have negative or dangerous effects" and that " further research is needed to ascertain the efficacy and safety" of such practices and medicinal plants used by traditional medicine systems. [1] As a result, the WHO has implemented a nine-year strategy to "support Member States in developing proactive policies and implementing action plans that will strengthen the role traditional medicine plays in keeping populations healthy."

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinary_medicine
Veterinary medicine is the branch of medicine that deals with the prevention, control, diagnosis, and treatment of disease, disorder, and injury in animals . Along with this, it deals with animal rearing, husbandry, breeding, research on nutrition, and product development. The scope of veterinary medicine is wide, covering all animal species, both domesticated and wild , with a wide range of conditions that can affect different species.
Veterinary medicine is widely practiced, both with and without professional supervision. Professional care is most often led by a veterinary physician (also known as a veterinarian, veterinary surgeon, or "vet"), but also by paraveterinary workers , such as veterinary nurses or technicians.  This can be augmented by other paraprofessionals with specific specialties, such as animal physiotherapy or dentistry , and species-relevant roles such as farriers .
Veterinary science helps human health through the monitoring and control of zoonotic disease ( infectious disease transmitted from nonhuman animals to humans), food safety, and indirectly through human applications from basic medical research. They also help to maintain food supply through livestock health monitoring and treatment, and mental health by keeping pets healthy and long-living. Veterinary scientists often collaborate with epidemiologists and other health or natural scientists, depending on type of work. Ethically, veterinarians are usually obliged to look after animal welfare. Veterinarians diagnose, treat, and help keep animals safe and healthy.
