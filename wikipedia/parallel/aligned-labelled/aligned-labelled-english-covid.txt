https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome_coronavirus_2

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS‑CoV‑2 ) [2] is the virus that causes COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), the respiratory illness responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic . [3] Also colloquially known simply as the coronavirus , it was previously referred to by its provisional name , 2019 novel coronavirus ( 2019-nCoV ), [4] [5] [6] [7] and has also been called human coronavirus 2019 ( HCoV-19 or hCoV-19 ). [8] [9] [10] [11] The World Health Organization declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020, and a pandemic on 11 March 2020. [12] [13] SARS‑CoV‑2 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus [14] that is contagious in humans. [15] As described by the US National Institutes of Health , it is the successor to SARS-CoV-1 , the virus that caused the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak . [16]
SARS‑CoV‑2 is a virus of the species severe acute respiratory syndrome–related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV). [2] It is believed to have zoonotic origins and has close genetic similarity to bat coronaviruses, suggesting it emerged from a bat-borne virus . [9] [17] Research is ongoing as to whether SARS‑CoV‑2 came directly from bats or indirectly through any intermediate hosts. [18] The virus shows little genetic diversity , indicating that the spillover event introducing SARS‑CoV‑2 to humans is likely to have occurred in late 2019. [19]

The 2020 stock market crash was a major and sudden global stock market crash that began on 20 February 2020 and ended on 7 April.
Beginning on 13 May 2019, the yield curve on U.S. Treasury securities inverted , [1] and remained so until 11 October 2019, when it reverted to normal . [2] Through 2019, while some economists (including Campbell Harvey and former New York Federal Reserve economist Arturo Estrella) argued that a recession in the following year was likely, [3] [4] other economists (including the managing director of Wells Fargo Securities Michael Schumacher and San Francisco Federal Reserve President Mary C. Daly ) argued that inverted yield curves may no longer be a reliable recession predictor. [5] [2] The yield curve on U.S. Treasuries would not invert again until 30 January 2020 when the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern , [6] [7] four weeks after local health commission officials in Wuhan , China announced the first 27 COVID-19 cases as a viral pneumonia strain outbreak on 1 January . [8]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/501.V2_variant

Lineage B.1.351 [a] is a variant of SARS-CoV-2 , the virus that causes COVID-19 . One of several SARS-CoV-2 variants believed to be of particular importance , it was first detected in the Nelson Mandela Bay [5] metropolitan area of the Eastern Cape province of South Africa in October 2020, [6] which was reported by the country's health department on 18 December 2020. [7] Phylogeographic analysis suggests this variant emerged in the Nelson Mandela Bay already in July or August 2020. [8]
A genomics team lead by the KwaZulu-Natal Research Innovation and Sequencing Platform (KRISP) at the University of KwaZulu-Natal discovered the new variant. [9] It was uncovered by whole genome sequencing . Several genomic sequences from this lineage were submitted to the GISAID sequence database. [10] [ better source needed ]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus

Coronaviruses are a group of related RNA viruses that cause diseases in mammals and birds . In humans and birds, they cause respiratory tract infections that can range from mild to lethal. Mild illnesses in humans include some cases of the common cold (which is also caused by other viruses , predominantly rhinoviruses ), while more lethal varieties can cause SARS , MERS , and COVID-19 . In cows and pigs they cause diarrhea , while in mice they cause hepatitis and encephalomyelitis .
Coronaviruses constitute the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae , in the family Coronaviridae , order Nidovirales , and realm Riboviria . [4] [5] They are enveloped viruses with a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome and a nucleocapsid of helical symmetry. [6] The genome size of coronaviruses ranges from approximately 26 to 32 kilobases , one of the largest among RNA viruses. [7] They have characteristic club-shaped spikes that project from their surface, which in electron micrographs create an image reminiscent of the solar corona , from which their name derives. [8]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVAX

COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access , abbreviated as COVAX , is a worldwide initiative aimed at equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines directed by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance (formerly the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization, or GAVI),  the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), and the World Health Organization (WHO).  It is one of the three pillars of the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator , an initiative begun in April 2020 by the WHO, the European Commission , and the government of France as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic . COVAX coordinates international resources to enable low-to-middle-income countries equitable access to COVID-19 tests , therapies , and vaccines . [1] By 15 July 2020, 165 countries – representing 60% of the human population – had joined COVAX. [2] However, as of 11 April 2021, COVAX is falling short of its goal, having delivered 38.5 million doses despite a goal of 100 million by the end of March. [3] [4]
As of 9 May 2021, the WHO has approved the Oxford–AstraZeneca , the Pfizer–BioNTech , the Moderna as well as the Sinopharm BBIBP-CorV and Johnson & Johnson vaccines for emergency use. [5] These vaccines can be distributed as part of COVAX. [5] [6]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_Advisory_Board

The COVID-19 Advisory Board was announced in November 2020 by then- President-elect of the United States Joe Biden as part of his presidential transition . It was co-chaired by physicians David A. Kessler , Marcella Nunez-Smith , and Vivek Murthy and comprises 13 health experts. The board was then succeeded by the White House COVID-19 Response Team upon Biden's presidency.
Before naming any White House staff or cabinet appointments, Biden announced that he will appoint a COVID-19 task force, co-chaired by former Surgeon General Vivek Murthy , former Food and Drug Administration Commissioner David Kessler and Yale University epidemiologist Professor Marcella Nunez-Smith . [3] [4] In November 2020, he announced the names of 13 health experts to serve on the COVID-19 Advisory Board. [5] Biden pledged a more and larger federal government response to the pandemic than Donald Trump , akin to President Franklin D. Roosevelt 's New Deal during the Great Depression . [6] This would include increased testing for SARS-CoV-2 , a steady supply of personal protective equipment , distributing a vaccine and securing money from Congress for schools and hospitals under the aegis of a national "supply chain commander" who would coordinate the logistics of manufacturing and distributing protective gear and test kits. This would be distributed by a "Pandemic Testing Board", also similar to Roosevelt's War Production Board during World War II . [6] Biden also pledged to invoke the Defense Production Act more aggressively than Trump in order to build up supplies, as well as the mobilization of up to 100,000 Americans for a "public health jobs corps" of contact tracers to help track and prevent outbreaks.

The COVID-19 pandemic , also known as the coronavirus pandemic , is an ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan , China . The World Health Organization declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern regarding COVID-19 on 30 January 2020, and later declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020. As of 1 June 2021, more than 170 million cases have been confirmed, with more than 3.55 million confirmed deaths attributed to COVID-19, making it one of the deadliest pandemics in history .
Symptoms of COVID-19 are highly variable, ranging from none to life-threateningly severe. COVID-19 transmits when people breathe in air contaminated by droplets and small airborne particles. The risk of breathing these in is highest when people are in close proximity, but they can be inhaled over longer distances, particularly indoors. Transmission can also occur if splashed or sprayed with contaminated fluids, in the eyes nose or mouth, and rarely via contaminated surfaces. People remain contagious for up to 20 days, and can spread the virus even if they do not develop any symptoms. [5] [6]

The COVID-19 pandemic in Papua New Guinea is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID-19 ) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS-CoV-2 ). The virus was confirmed to have reached Papua New Guinea on 20 March 2020. [3] On 4 May 2020, Papua New Guinea was declared COVID-19 free. However, on 20 June, the government confirmed another case of COVID-19, meaning that the disease was present again within the country. [4] [5]
Until early 2021, the country managed to stave off a major COVID-19 outbreak, with only 1,275 cases reported at the end of February according to Johns Hopkins University. In March cases tripled, with Prime Minister James Marape speaking of "rampant community transmission". [6] By early May, the number of hospitalizations in the capital Port Moresby stabilized, but delays in receiving test results from regional areas were a concern. [7] In mid May, as the reasons for the apparent easing of the pandemic situation remained uncertain, discrepancies between government figures and higher ones from the provinces led to concerns that hundreds of COVID-19 cases had been missed in the national tally.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatten_the_curve

Flattening the curve is a public health strategy to slow down the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus during the COVID-19 pandemic . The curve being flattened is the epidemic curve , a visual representation of the number of infected people needing health care over time. During an epidemic, a health care system can break down when the number of people infected exceeds the capability of the health care system's ability to take care of them. Flattening the curve means slowing the spread of the epidemic so that the peak number of people requiring care at a time is reduced, and the health care system does not exceed its capacity. Flattening the curve relies on mitigation techniques such as hand washing , use of face masks and social distancing .
A complementary measure is to increase health care capacity, to "raise the line". [4] As described in an article in The Nation , "preventing a health care system from being overwhelmed requires a society to do two things: 'flatten the curve'—that is, slow the rate of infection so there aren't too many cases that need hospitalization at one time—and 'raise the line'—that is, boost the hospital system's capacity to treat large numbers of patients." [5] As of April 2020 [update] , in the case of the COVID-19 pandemic, two key measures are to increase the numbers of available ICU beds and ventilators , which are in systemic shortage .

The event was originally conceived by a civil engineering student named Josh Swain from Tucson, Arizona on April 24, 2020. [1] [2] It gained popularity after a screenshot of a Facebook Messenger group chat involving several users named Josh Swain spread widely on the Internet . [3]
Swain encouraged participants of the chat to meet at a set of coordinates and compete for the right to use the name " Josh ". The event, though initially intended as a joke, drew a crowd of nearly a thousand on the day of the event. Despite the title, the gathering was lighthearted and there was no actual violence involved. [4] [5] The Wall Street Journal wrote that the event became a "global news phenomenon." [6]

Operation Moonshot is a UK government programme to introduce same day mass testing for COVID-19 in England as a way of enabling large gatherings of people to take place in that country while maintaining control over the virus. According to the British Medical Journal , the programme aims to deliver 10 million tests per day by 2021.
The programme has raised concerns because of its expected cost—£100bn according to a leaked government document, which is about three-quarters of the total annual cost of NHS England . Statisticians have moreover warned that given the inaccuracies inherent in any test, mass testing at this scale is liable to cause hundreds of thousands of false positives a day, resulting in very large numbers of people being told that they are infected when they are not.

Socio-economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is covered by:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stay-at-home_order
A stay-at-home order , safer-at-home order , movement control order (more common in Southeast Asia), or lockdown restrictions (in the United Kingdom ) – also referred to by loose use of the terms (self-) quarantine , (self-) isolation , or lockdown – is an order from a government authority that restricts movements of a population as a mass quarantine strategy for suppressing or mitigating an epidemic or pandemic by ordering residents to stay home except for essential tasks or for work in essential businesses. The medical distinction between such an order and a quarantine is that a quarantine is usually understood to involve isolating only selected people who are considered to be possibly infectious rather than the entire population of an area (though many colloquially refer to stay-at-home orders as quarantines.) In many cases, outdoor activities are allowed. Non-essential businesses are either closed or adapted to working from home . [1] In some regions, it has been implemented as a round-the-clock curfew [2] or called a shelter-in-place order , [3] but it is not to be confused with a shelter-in-place situation. [4] Similar measures have been used around the world, and, both officially and colloquially, different names have been used to refer to them, often only very loosely linked to the term's actual medical meaning. Examples include confinement , (self-) isolation , ( self-) quarantine , lockdown or ‘strict social distancing measures’. [5] Stay-at-home orders have colloquially (and sometimes officially) been referred to as quarantine or lockdown - but some officials have a concern that the word lockdown may send a wrong message for people to incorrectly think that it includes door-to-door searching for infected people to be forced into quarantines similar to the Hubei lockdown . [6]
The term lockdown was used by the media and the World Health Organization (WHO) to describe the action taken in January 2020 by the government of China to restrict movements of people in order to control the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan . [7] [8] When Italian authorities imposed a strict quarantine order in the northern part of the country, the media also used the term lockdown, which was used for Spain and France , as well as other countries around the world. [9] [10] [11] [12] Although it is not a technical term in public health or laws, the media continued to use lockdown to describe the actions taken by these governments. [13] As the lockdowns were expanded to other countries, there was a shift in the definitions. Measures are less restrictive and other terms emerged in attempts to differentiate from the most restrictive measure in China. [5]
When the authorities in San Francisco Bay Area in the United States issued an order in March 2020 for residents to stay home to control the outbreak of COVID-19, they called it a shelter-in-place order . [14] People were not familiar with it as the term shelter in place had been used in other emergency situations such as an active shooter which would require seeking a safe place to hide within the same building that the person already occupies until the situation is resolved. [15] This caused confusion to the residents under the order on what exactly they are supposed to do. [16]
