Coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID-19 ) is an infectious disease caused by SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) , [8] a virus closely related to the SARS virus . [9] [10] [11]
The disease is the cause of the COVID-19 pandemic . [12] [13] Those who get the disease might get a fever , dry cough , fatigue (tiredness) and shortness of breath. A sore throat, runny nose or sneezing is less common. In very bad cases, they can even get a much worse fever, fewer white blood cells , and loss of appetite. They might cough up blood, and have kidney failure .
People with this disease can get pneumonia and multi-organ failure if they are weak, old, or are already sick. [12] [13] There are people who are called asymptomatic carriers , which means that they did not have all or some of the symptoms of the virus. This is very dangerous since they may not know that they have the virus and can give it to other people without knowing it.
The countries with the most sick people are the USA, India and Brazil. COVID-19 virus travels from person to person through the air like the common cold does. Scientists think the virus is not able to hang in the air a long time and go far like the measles virus does. [14]

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome_coronavirus_2
SARS coronavirus 2 ( SARS-CoV-2 ) is a positive-sense , single-stranded RNA coronavirus which causes the disease COVID-19 . [2] It used to be known as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by the World Health Organization (WHO). [3] [4]
The virus started the 2019–20 coronavirus outbreak . [5] [6] [7] The first suspected cases were reported to the WHO on December 31, 2019. [8] [9] Many early cases of this new coronavirus were linked to Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, a large seafood and animal market in Wuhan , China. The virus may have come from infected animals. It is not certain that this place was the source of the pandemic . [10]
The genetic material of this virus showed many similarities to SARS-CoV (79.5%) [11] and bat coronaviruses (96%). [11] This means the virus may have originally come from bats . [12] [13] [14] Scientists did more experiments that showed the virus probably went from bats to an intermediate host , meaning another animal in between bats and humans.  The viruses in that other animal changed over time until they could infect humans.  Scientists are close to sure that the original animal was a bat but not sure what the intermediate animal was. [15] Some scientists think it could have been a pangolin because there are coronaviruses that live in pangolins even though they are not exactly the same as SARS-CoV-2 or the ones in bats. [16] Pangolins are an endangered species and buying, selling or moving them from place to place is illegal in China and many other countries.  But their scales are an ingredient in many traditional Chinese medicines , so they are often sold on the black market . [17]
Although SARS-CoV-2 began in bats, scientists noticed that the bats do not get sick and die from it.  They think this is because the bats have very careful immune systems that fight the virus without causing inflammation .  Scientists are studying bats because of this. [18] [19]

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_stock_market_crash
The 2020 stock market crash is a global stock market crash that began on 20 February 2020 during the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic . [1] [2] [3] The Dow Jones Industrial Average , S&P 500 Index , and the NASDAQ-100 all fell into short-term decline on 27 February during one of the worst trading weeks since the financial crisis of 2007–08 . [4] [5]
Markets over the following week (2–6 March) became extremely bad, with swings of 3% or more being made per daily session (except for 6 March). [6] [7] On 9 March, all three Wall Street indices fell more than 7% and most global markets reported severe losses, due to the response of the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic and the Russia–Saudi Arabia oil price war . [8] [9]
This became known as Black Monday , and at the time was the worst drop since the Great Recession in 2008. [10] [11]
Three days after Black Monday there was another drop, Black Thursday , where stocks across Europe and North America fell more than 9%.

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/501.V2_variant
The 501Y.V2 variant , also known as South African COVID-19 variant , is a variant of the SARS-CoV-2 , the virus that causes COVID-19 . It is one of several SARS-CoV-2 variants. It was first detected in the Nelson Mandela Bay [1] metropolitan area of the Eastern Cape province of South Africa .
On 23 December 2020, the United Kingdom health minister Matt Hancock said that two people who had travelled from South Africa to the United Kingdom were infected with the 501.V2. [2] On 28 December, the variant was detected in two people in Switzerland [3] and one in Finland . [4]
The United States reported its first cases of the variant in the U.S. state of South Carolina . [5]

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Thursday_(2020)
Black Thursday [1] was a global stock market crash on March 12, 2020 as part of the greater 2020 stock market crash . Global stock markets suffered the greatest single-day fall since the 1987 stock market crash . [2]
Following Black Monday three days earlier, Black Thursday was caused by the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic and a lack of investor confidence in United States President Donald Trump after he added a 30-day travel ban against the Schengen Area . [3]

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus
Coronaviruses are a group of RNA viruses . [5] [6] They cause diseases in birds and mammals , including humans . These diseases can be mild, or they can be fatal. In humans and birds, they cause respiratory tract infections. Mild illnesses in humans include some cases of the common cold (which is also caused by other viruses, for example rhinoviruses ). More lethal varieties can cause SARS , MERS , and COVID-19 .
They are enveloped viruses with a positive-sense RNA genome . [7] The genome size of coronaviruses is about 26 to 32 kilobases, [8] which is extraordinarily large for an RNA virus . There are four major groups of coronaviruses, called alpha, beta, gamma and delta.
The most famous coronavirus is one of the betas, the kind that causes Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in humans.
The name "coronavirus" comes from the Latin word corona , meaning "crown" or "halo", and refers to how virions look under an electron microscopy (E.M.). [9] They have a fringe of large, bulbous surface projections looking like a crown. This morphology is created by the viral spike (S) peplomers , which are proteins on the surface of the virus. They decide which cells the virus can infect.

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVAX
COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access , abbreviated as COVAX , is a global program that helps give COVID-19 vaccines to people living in poor countries led by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance ,  the World Health Organization (WHO), the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), and others. [1]
By 15 July 2020, 165 countries – representing 60% of the human population – had joined COVAX. [2]

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_lockdowns
COVID-19 pandemic caused many governments to limit the spread of the disease by adding stay-at-home orders , curfews , quarantines , cordons sanitaires and similar societal restrictions. [1] By April 2020, about half of the world's population was under some form of lockdown, with more than 3.9 billion people in more than 90 countries or territories having been asked or ordered to stay at home by their governments. [2]

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic , also called the coronavirus pandemic , is a current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). [1] [6] [b] The outbreak started in Wuhan , Hubei , China, in December 2019. The World Health Organization (WHO) called it a pandemic on 11 March 2020. [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses gave the virus its name. As of February 19, 2021, more than 110 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in more than 188 countries and territories. More than two million people have died of COVID-19, [12] and more than 85 million people have defeated, or recovered from the disease. [12] [13] [14]
The virus usually moves from one person to another with small drops made when coughing [15] [16] or sneezing . [17] It mostly spreads when people are close to each other, which is why social distancing is encouraged. Coronavirus can also spread when people touch a surface with the virus, and then they touch their face. [16] [17] Common symptoms include fever , cough, and trouble breathing. [18] The illness can worsen with pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome . [19] As of January 2021, a number of vaccines for COVID-19 have been developed, but only a few have been approved as safe for use. The first vaccine to be approved was created by Pfizer and BioNTech , [20] followed by the Oxford / AstraZeneca [21] vaccine. Vaccine distribution has begun in many countries in Europe, North America, South America and Asia. [22] The United Kingdom was the first western country to administer a COVID-19 vaccine. [23] No antiviral medicine for COVID-19 is available. [24] Doctors usually give patients supportive therapy instead. [25] People can avoid spreading the virus by regularly washing their hands, covering their mouth when coughing, maintaining distance from other people , staying away from crowds, wearing medical or cloth face coverings, and being alone for people who think they are infected, also known as quarantining . [24]
The outbreak might be from a coronavirus that usually lives in bats . This infected another animal, possibly a pangolin . It then changed inside that other animal until it could infect humans. [26] It originated at a wet market Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market and is linked to China’s wild animal meat trade. Live foxes , crocodiles , wolf pups, giant salamanders , snakes , rats , peacocks , porcupines , koalas and game meats were on the menu at the market. [27] A 55-year-old person from Hubei province was the first human to contract the virus on November 17, 2019. [28] A 61-year-old man who was a regular customer at the market was the first person to die from the virus on January 11, 2020. [29] The exact origin of the virus is still unknown since the market in Wuhan sold a variety of live wild animals in cages. Chinese tourists have spread the virus by traveling to other countries and made it a worldwide pandemic. [30]
Racism and xenophobia against Chinese people and Asians increased during the pandemic.

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_the_United_Kingdom
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic spread to the United Kingdom in late January 2020. By 13 May there had been 
229,705 confirmed cases [nb 4] and 
33,186 deaths overall. [nb 2]
More than 90% of those dying had underlying illnesses or were over 60 years old. The infection rate was higher in care homes than in the community. There were large regional difference in the outbreak's severity. The outbreak in London had the highest total number and the most infections. England and Wales were the UK countries with the highest recorded death rate per head, and Northern Ireland had the lowest.
The Department of Health and Social Care created a public health campaign to help slow the virus's spread, and began posting daily updates in early February.
In February, the Heath Secretary , Matt Hancock , proposed the Health Protection (Coronavirus) Regulations 2020 . Hospitals set up drive-through screening (testing for the disease). The Chief Medical Officer for England, Chris Whitty , created a four-stage strategy to tackle the outbreak: contain, delay, research and mitigate (help, lessen).

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_recession
The coronavirus recession , also known as the Great Lockdown [1] or Great Shutdown , [2] is an ongoing major global economic recession affecting the world economy in early 2020 [3] [4] [5] during the COVID-19 pandemic . [6] [7]
The recession has caused the largest economic downturn since the Great Depression . [8] On 14 April 2020, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) reported that all of the G7 nations had already entered or were entering into what was called a "deep recession". [9] The IMF has stated that the economic decline is "far worse" than that of the Great Recession in 2009. [10] [11] [12] [13]
The pandemic has led to more than a third of the world's population being placed on lockdown to stop the spread of COVID-19 . [14] This has caused severe economic downfalls for economies across the world, [15] following soon after a global economic slowdown during 2019 that saw a lowering numbers in stock markets worldwide. [16] [17]
The United Nations (UN) predicted in April 2020 that global unemployment will wipe out 6.7 per cent of working hours globally in the second quarter of 2020—equivalent to 195 million full-time workers. [18]

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_testing
COVID-19 testing can help find the SARS-CoV-2 virus. There are two types of test; one can find the virus (i.e. Polymerase chain reaction , also called PCR) and the other that can find antibodies produced in response to infection .
An accurate mortality rate of the disease and the level of herd immunity in the population can be found from the results of these tests. However, it is still not known how long immunity will last, and how effective it will be. [1]
Due to limited testing, as of March 2020, no countries had reliable data of the virus. [2]

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_vaccine
A COVID-19 vaccine is any of the vaccines used against the Coronavirus Disease 2019 ( COVID-19 pandemic ). In July 2020, more than 150 vaccines were being developed in different laboratories. [1] Two mRNA vaccines , one by Pfizer and one by Moderna , were approved late in 2020. Both are over 90% effective. [2] A few vaccines also went into use in early 2021.
Several countries plan to give the vaccine to many people, but their plans are different. The United Kingdom plans to use its National Health Service .  Canada plans to use its military. The United States plans to send vaccines to all fifty states and then let the state governments each make their own system. [3]
The United Kingdom approved the Pfizer vaccine before the European Union or United States did. They began giving it to people on December 8. [4] The United States began giving people the vaccine on December 14, starting with health care workers in New York City . [5] By April 2021, several vaccines were in use around the world and hundreds of millions of people had been vaccinated.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect a vaccine against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative virus, to become available in less than 18 months. [6] The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) – which is organizing a US$2 billion worldwide fund for fast investment and creation of vaccine candidates [7] – indicated in April that a vaccine may be available under emergency use protocols in less than 12 months or by early 2021. [8] On 4 May 2020, the WHO organized a telethon (fundraising event broadcasted via televisions) to raise US$8 billion from forty countries to support rapid development of vaccines to prevent COVID-19 infections and deaths. [9] The United States government started Operation Warp Speed to develop a vaccine by January 2021. [1]

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brett_E._Crozier
Brett E. Crozier is an American naval officer. When he was captain of the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt , he noticed that some of his crew had caught COVID-19 , a serious disease that affects the lungs and breathing.  Late in March, 2020, he wrote letters asking for permission to send his sick sailors off his ship to Guam .  These letters were found and printed in a newspaper.  A few days later, the Navy fired Crozier as the captain of the Theodore Roosevelt but did not fire him from the Navy entirely. [1] [2] [3]
In late April, some leaders in the Navy asked that Crozier be reinstated and sent back as captain of the Theodore Roosevelt . [4]
Brett Crozier is from Santa Rosa , California .  He graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1992 and became a pilot for the Navy in 1994.  He fought in Iraq in 2003.  He later earned a Master's Degree in National Security and Strategic Studies at the Naval War College .  He served in many different positions in the Navy, including Executive Officer of the USS Ronald Reagan .  Brett Crozier was captain of the USS Blue Ridge from June 2017 to November 2018. [5]
He wrote more than twenty copies of a four-page letter, dated March 30, 2020.  He addressed it to senior officials in the military.  He asked for permission to send 1000 of his crew off the ship.  The ship had more than 4000 people on it.  Someone found his messages and they were printed in the newspaper San Francisco Chronicle on March 31, 2020.

Diamond Princess is a British-registered cruise ship owned and operated by Princess Cruises . She began operation in March 2004 and mainly cruises in Asia during the northern hemisphere summer and Australia during the southern hemisphere summer.
Diamond Princess was built in Nagasaki, Japan , by Mitsubishi Industries .
There have been two known outbreaks of infectious disease on the ship – an outbreak of gastroenteritis caused by norovirus in 2016 and an outbreak of the COVID-19 coronavirus in 2020. [1] At least 712 out of the 3,711 passengers and crew were infected, [1] and fourteen have died. [2]

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farmers_to_Families_Food_Box
The Farmers to Families Food Box program is set up by the United States ' government during the COVID-19 pandemic to help get fresh food from farmers to consumers. The food is put into "family-sized" boxes containing produce, dairy products and/or meat. The programs is run by the USDA ( Department of Agriculture ).  It is part of the government's general response to the pandemic, called the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program  run by the USDA.  It was announced on April 15, 2020. According to the program's home page, over 70,000,000 boxes were invoiced between the start date and then end of August. [1] As of the second week of August 2020, the program's budget was three billion dollars. [2]
The USDA buys the produce from farmers. Then the food is sent to local packaging companies.  These companies distribute the packages to local organizations such as NGOs and religious orga
nizations. The program sets no restrictions on which families may pick of the boxes. [3]
The program has been positively received.  However, there has been some criticism.  For example, the boxes weigh forty pounds.  This can make it difficult for people without a car to get the boxes home.  Also, the program initially only had boxes with produce, dairy products and meat.

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatten_the_curve
Flattening the curve is a public health strategy to slow down the spread of the COVID-19 virus during the COVID-19 pandemic . The curve being flattened is the epidemic curve , a representation of the number of infected people needing health care over time.
During an epidemic, a health care system can break down when the number of people infected passes the health care system's ability to take care of them.
Flattening the curve means slowing the spread of the epidemic so that the peak number of people requiring care at a time is reduced, and the health care system does not pass its capacity.
Flattening the curve relies on techniques such as quarantine , stay at home orders , and social distancing .

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_fight
The Josh Fight was a viral internet meme and pretend fight at Air Park in Lincoln, Nebraska , on April 24, 2021. [1] [2]
A college student named Josh Swain from Tucson, Arizona had the idea for the Josh Fight.  He was bored because of the COVID-19 pandemic , and this gave him the idea. [3] He talked about it on April 24, 2020. After a screenshot of a Facebook Messenger group chat involving several users named Josh spread widely on the internet , many people learned about the Josh Fight.
Swain told other people named Josh Swain to meet at a set of coordinates , where they would fight for the right to be the only person to be called "Josh Swain." Later, more people with the first name Josh became interested.  Swain meant this as a joke, but several hundred people showed up on the day of the event. Despite the title, there was no violence involved and the gathering was lighthearted.  Fighting involved playing rock, paper, scissors and hitting each other with pool noodles made of light foam.  The fighters raised over $7000 for charity.  A four-year-old fighter, Joshua Vinson Jr., nicknamed "Little Josh," won the fight. [4]

The COVID-19 pandemic started in the city of Wuhan, China in December 2019. It has led to increased acts of prejudice , xenophobia , discrimination , racism and violence against people of Southeast Asian , Hispanic , East Asian , Native American , biracial and black people all over the world. With the spread of the pandemic and in formation of hotspots, like those in Asia , Europe and the Americas , discrimination against people from these hotspots was reported.
According to the Embassy of Japan in Cairo , store clerks were hesitating to serve Japanese customers. "Corona" became a new slur by which to abuse Japanese people on the street. [1]
On 10 March 2020, an Uber driver was arrested when a viral video forcibly removing a Chinese passenger in Cairo's Maadi district. The passenger was thought to have the coronavirus. The incident caused an uproar among Egyptians when the video was uploaded. Some Egyptians visited the Chinese man in his hotel room. [2]
Violence toward foreign people was reported during the pandemic. Some local people attacked foreign people. The attackers published a number of photos of them under social media and linked them to the Covid-19. [3]

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misinformation_related_to_the_COVID-19_pandemic
The pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 has caused a large number of conspiracy theories and misinformation about where the pandemic started, how serious it is and the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. [1] [2] [3]
According to the World Health Organization , the pandemic was also an infodemic , with misinformation spreading like disease. [2] This was because social media let information spread quickly, because celebrities sometimes repeated conspiracy theories, and because many people were locked down at home without much else to listen to.  When doctors or government officials went on television to say these conspiracy theories were wrong, that only made people think the conspiracy theories were important enough for doctors and officials to talk about. [4] One group of scientists said governments could use conspiracy theories to distract people from real problems. [5]
Fake information has been spread through social media, [6] text messages, [7] and mass media , [8] including the state media of countries such as China, [9] [10] Russia, [11] [12] Iran, [13] and Turkmenistan. [2] [14]
It has been spread by celebrities, politicians [15] [16] (including leaders in countries such as the United States, [17] [18] Iran, [19] and Brazil [20] ), and other important public figures. [21] Commercial scams have claimed to offer at-home tests and "miracle" cures. [22] [23]

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Moonshot
Operation Moonshot is a programme by the UK government to allow many people in England to be tested for COVID-19 as a way to allow large gatherings of people to happen there while maintaining control over the virus. According to the British Medical Journal , the programme aims to perform 10 million tests per day by 2021.
People are worried about it because, as a leaked government document says, it is thought it may cost £100bn, which is about three-quarters of what the NHS England costs every year. Statisticians say because any test can have inaccuracies, mass testing at this scale might cause hundreds of thousands of false positives a day, resulting in very large numbers of people being told they are infected when they are not infected. [1]

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pfizer%E2%80%93BioNTech_COVID-19_vaccine
Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is a COVID-19 vaccine , developed by BioNTech , Pfizer and Fosun Pharmaceutical.
The vaccine is given by injection . It is an RNA vaccine made of nucleoside -modified mRNA which is meant to create spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 . [1]

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remdesivir
Remdesivir is a broad-spectrum antiviral medication created by the biopharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences . [1] It was designed to treat Ebola .
As of 2020, remdesivir is being tested as a specific treatment for COVID-19 . It is being used for the sickest of patients during the pandemic . [2] It may shorten the time it takes to recover from the infection. [3] Treatment is given by injection into a vein . [4] [5]
On May 1, the United States Food and Drug Administration gave doctors permission to use remdesivir on patients with COVID-19.  Ordinarily, the FDA would test remdesivir first to see if it worked on patients with COVID-19, but because of the COVID-19 pandemic, they told doctors they could start using the drug before the tests were finished.
In October 2020, the National Institutes of Health told the world the results of its tests: They studied 11,000 people and found that remdesivir did not help keep COVID-19 patients alive.  Gilead and some scientists said the results of the tests might not be correct. [6]

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socio-economic_impact_of_the_COVID-19_pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a larger effect more than the disease itself. As the SARS-CoV-2 virus has spread around the globe, many people have begun to think about the economic effects such as the decreased business and unemployment. [1] The pandemic caused the largest global recession in history , with more than a third of the global population at the time being placed on lockdown . [2]
Supply shortages were expected to affect a number of sectors due to panic buying , increased usage of goods to during the pandemic, and people raising up prices on needed products such as masks, toilet paper, plastic gloves and hand sanitizer . [3] Reports of lack of food or groceries were said. [4] [5] [6] The pandemic also caused many social events to be pushed back such as concert delays and movie release dates. Many movie theaters are being put out of business.
There was an increase in gleaning , meaning people going to farms to pick up food plants left over on the ground after a harvest.  Because restaurants and other food businesses canceled their orders, farmers had more extra crops than usual.  People formed new organizations to find farmers with extra food, organize people to collect it, and transport it to food banks and other places where people could get to it. [7]
Global stock markets fell on 24 February 2020 due to a significant rise in the number of COVID-19 cases outside mainland China. [8] [9] By 28 February 2020, stock markets worldwide saw their largest single-week declines since the 2008 financial crisis . [10] [11] [12] Global stock markets crashed in March 2020 . [13]

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stay-at-home_order
A stay-at-home order (North America) or a movement control order (Southeast Asia) is an order from a government to lower/end movements of a population as a mass quarantine move for stopping an epidemic , or pandemic . This is done by ordering residents to stay home except for essential tasks or to work in essential businesses.
In many cases, outdoor activities are allowed. Nonessential businesses are either closed or made to working from home. [1]
In some regions, it has added a curfew [2] or called a shelter-in-place order , [3] but it is not to be confused with a shelter in place situation. [4]
Similar measures have been used around the world, but the term lockdown is used instead. [5] [6]

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variants_of_SARS-CoV-2

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has a lot of variants. Some of them are important because of increased transmission and vaccines being less effective on them. [1] [2] This article discusses relevant variants of SARS-CoV-2 and mutations in these variants.
The variant WIV04/2019 is most closely related to the original virus when it began infecting humans. [3]
There are a lot of lineages of SARS-CoV-2. [4] Lineages are variants that are genetically the same.

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Coronavirus_Task_Force
The White House Coronavirus Task Force was a United States Department of State task force that focuses on the spread and limiting of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). [1] The task force was created on January 29, 2020. [2]
On February 26, 2020, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence was named to chair the task force, and Deborah Birx was named the response coordinator. [3] Other members have been added since the initial appointments. [4]



https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_COVID-19_outbreak
In September and October 2020, multiple people at the White House tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 , the virus that causes COVID-19 .
On September 16, it was reported that at least one unnamed staffer had tested positive. [2]
On October 1, President Donald Trump , his wife Melania Trump , press advisor Hope Hicks , presidential campaign manager Bill Stepien , and former White House counselor Kellyanne Conway tested positive for the coronavirus. [3] [4] [5] [6] Claudia Conway, the daughter of Kellyanne Conway, announced on Oct 4 that she had tested positive as well. [7] On October 5, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany announced she had also tested positive. [8]
Trump tested positive days after the first presidential debate against Joe Biden in Cleveland, Ohio . Around eleven people tested positive who worked at the debates in Cleveland. [9] Some of Trump's personal aides who prepared him for the debates also tested positive. [10]

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan_Institute_of_Virology
The Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences ( WIV) is a research institute. It was designed to study virology . It is run by the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).  The institute is in Jiangxia District, Wuhan , Hubei . It opened China's first biosafety level 4 (BSL–4) laboratory in 2015. [1]
In January 2020, conspiracy theories spread which said that the the COVID-19 pandemic came from a virus made by the WIV. But scientific evidence says that the virus is natural. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] One story in the Washington Post said that US State Department had raised safety concerns about WIV's research on bat coronaviruses in 2018. [7] In April 2020, U.S. intelligence officials looked into reports the virus may have started by an accident by WIV scientists studying bats. [8] [9] [10] [11]
Experts do not believe the virus escaped from the institute. [12] [13] One expert said that up to seven million people in Southeast Asia are infected each year with bat coronaviruses. He said there are probably only about six people who work with the viruses at the institute.  It does not make sense that virus came from one of these of people compared with the millions of other people affected by bats. The staff at the Wuhan Institute of Virology were trained at US labs and follow high safety standards. The evidence shows that this is not a laboratory accident.
The WIV started in 1956 as the Wuhan Microbiology Laboratory under the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). In 1961, it became the South China Institute of Microbiology, and in 1962 was renamed Wuhan Microbiology Institute. In June 1978 it was named Wuhan Institute of Virology. [14]
