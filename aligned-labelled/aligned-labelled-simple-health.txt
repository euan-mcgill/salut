https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health
Health is "a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease " according to the World Health Organization (WHO). [1] [2] Physical [ permanent dead link ] is about the body. Mental is about how people think and feel. Social talks about how people live with other people. It is about family , work, school, and friends. [3]
Physical fitness refers to good body health. It is dependent on genetic determinators and also on social, economic and ecological factors. That means, one's genes are partly responsible for one's physical health, but also other circumstances: where you live, how clean or polluted your water and the air around you is and also how good your social and medical system is. It is also the result of regular exercise , proper diet and nutrition , and proper rest for physical recovery . A person who is physically fit will be able to walk or run without getting breathless and they will be able to carry out the activities of everyday living and not need help. How much each person can do will depend on their age and whether they are a man or woman. A physically fit person usually has a normal weight for their height. The relation between their height and weight is called their Body Mass Index . A taller person can be heavier and still be fit. If a person is too heavy or too thin for their height it may affect their health. [3] Better health is central to human happiness and well-being. It also makes an important contribution to economic progress, as healthy populations live longer, are more productive, and save more. Many factors influence health status and a country's ability to provide quality health services for its people. [4]
Mental health refers to a person's emotional and psychological well-being. "A state of emotional and psychological well-being in which an individual is able to use his or her thinking and emotional (feeling) abilities, function in society , and meet the ordinary demands of everyday life."
One way to think about mental health is by looking at how well a person functions. Feeling capable and efficient ; being able to handle normal levels of stress , have good friends and family, and lead an independent life; and being able to "bounce back," or recover from hardships, are all signs of mental health.It’s normal for all of us to feel worried, sad, upset, or have difficult emotions from time-to-time. For most people though, these feelings are only temporary and are resolved without causing any long-term problems. However, for some people, these negative feelings can become worse over time and lead to a mental health problem such as depression, anxiety, stress or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). [5]
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abenomask
Abenomask is a Japanese political word named after Shinzo Abe . [1] It is used in Japan for two meanings: [2] [3] [4] [5]
Abenomask-like actions are taken in other regions including Spain [6] and the United States [7] etc.
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accident
An accident is when something goes wrong when it is not meant to. Physical accidents are things like collisions , injuries , and falling. Non-physical accidents are things like accidentally telling someone a secret, forgetting something important, or deleting an important computer file .
Road accidents kill thousands of people each month in the United States, and thousands each week in the world. They injure more thousands each week. The majority involve a car but there are also many bus , truck and bicycle accidents. Aircraft crashes, ship sinkings and other transport accidents also attract much attention.
Injuries from accidents, however, are more numerous at home than elsewhere. They attract less attention because only a few people are hurt at a time.
Often, accidents are investigated so that we can learn how to avoid them in the future. Sometimes by studying an accident we can discover new things, for example penicillin .
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amniocentesis
Amniocentesis is the name of a medical test that is often performed when screening babies . The test consist of taking a little Amniotic fluid , and testing this fluid . This fluid contains tissue of the embryo or fetus , and allows to determine the sex . It also allows to find certain birth defects .

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amniotic_sac
The amniotic sac holds a fetus while it is developing during pregnancy .  The amniotic sac is filled with amniotic fluid , which protects the fetus.
The amniotic sac starts to form and fill with amniotic fluid just days after a woman gets pregnant. [1] At first, the amniotic fluid is made from the mother's plasma (the liquid part of her blood ). [2]
At first, the amniotic fluid is made mostly of water with electrolytes (salts).  However, by the 12th to the 14th week of pregnancy, proteins , carbohydrates , lipids , phospholipids , and urea are all in the amniotic fluid. [2] These things help the fetus grow.
As the fetus gets bigger, more amniotic fluid gets created.  By the time the baby is born, there is about one liter of amniotic fluid in the amniotic sac. [3]
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant
An antioxidant is a molecule that can slow or stop the oxidation , or electron transfer, of other molecules.
Antioxidants can be found in food.
Antioxidants are molecules that relieve oxidative stress by preventing the formation and oxidation of free radicals. [1] Antioxidants donate one of their electrons or hydrogen to free radicals, stopping their chain reaction. [2] Found in our diet (for example, in vitamins) or formed inside our body (like enzymes), antioxidants can protect us from the damaging effects of free radicals. [3]
The best way to combat free radicals is to have a diet of fresh fruits and vegetables, red wine, and green tea. [2] [4] These functional foods are rich in phytochemicals with antioxidant properties. Health supplements enriched with antioxidants are also now widely available.
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldness
Baldness (also known as alopecia ) is when someone has no hair on his or her head . Sometimes this is inherited from parents or grandparents, or it can be done on purpose if somebody cuts off all their hair off. Some monks or South Korean soldiers in the army do this.
Baldness is most often caused by a medical condition known as androgenic alopecia . This is found in humans , as well as in some animals . When it occurs, it will mean that those affected will permanently lose some (or all) of their hair. Since some of the factors are linked to the genes on the chromosome , the condition can be seen more often with men, than with women.
Alopecia totalis is the loss of all head hair. Its cause is believed to be autoimmune , but many with the disorder lead relatively low stress lives.
Alopecia areata (AA) is a condition in which hair is lost from some or all areas of the body, usually from the scalp.[1][2] Because it causes bald spots on the scalp, especially in the first stages, it is sometimes called spot baldness.
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benign_paroxysmal_vertigo_of_childhood
Benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood (BPVC for short) is a medical problem that happens in children.  "Benign" means "harmless;" "paroxysmal" means something comes and goes suddenly; and " vertigo " means "dizziness."  So BPVC is harmless dizziness in children that comes and goes suddenly.
The dizziness usually makes children feel like they are moving or spinning, or that the inside of their head is moving or spinning.
Usually, BPVC starts in children between two and five years old.  It often goes away by the age of eight.  But in some children, BPVC may start when they are much younger (as young as a few months old) or older (as old as 12 years old).
BPVC is the most common cause of dizziness in children who do not have hearing loss or a diagnosed ear disease .  It is a common problem that happens to about 2.6% of children (26 out of 1,000 children).
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bite
A bite is a wound received from the teeth of an animal .  Animals may bite things in self-defence .  Animals also bite things to cut them into smaller pieces before they eat them.
Bites can cause many medical problems, such as:
Bite wounds should be washed, ideally with povidone-iodine soap and water.  The injury should then be loosely wrapped with a bandage .  Open bite wounds are not sutured because of the risk of infection.
Animal bites caused by carnivores (other than rodents ) may infect the victim with rabies if the animal that bit them carries it.  If possible, the animal is caught and the head is looked at for signs of rabies.  Signs of rabies include foaming at the mouth, self-mutilation, growling, jerky behaviour, and red eyes.  If the animal lives for ten days and does not develop rabies, then the animal probably is not infected.  In cases where the animal cannot be found, prophylactic rabies treatment is carried out in most places.
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_donation
Blood donation is when a person voluntarily gives blood, which can be used for blood transfusions or to make certain drugs . Blood banks store this blood. The blood can be used to help the victims of accidents , for example. Usually, the blood donor and the donated blood are tested for diseases which spread through the blood. These include various forms of Hepatitis , HIV and Syphilis . Usually a series of questions also need to be answered to make sure that there is no risk to the person donating.
A special case of blood donation sometimes occurs before a medical operation that is dangerous. People donate their own blood, which can be used after the operation if they lose too much blood.
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar
Blood sugar is an amount of glucose present in the blood of humans or animals . It is the primary source for energy for body cells and blood lipids. Low blood sugar means hypoglycemia . High blood sugar means hyperglycemia . People with diabetes mellitus have high blood sugar.
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_modification
Body modification (or body alteration) is when a person changes their body in a way that lasts forever or for a long time. There are many different kinds of body modification, like piercing , circumcision , or tattoos . Almost all cultures do some kind of body modification.
People who do not like body modification sometimes call it "disfigurement" or "mutilation." They believe that if someone changes their body, it is wrong and they are doing something dangerous or unethical .
Body modification is done for different reasons. Religions might tell people that they should change their bodies to look a certain way. Other people with body modifications might just like the way the body modifications look, or how they feel good during sex .
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumcision
Circumcision is an operation in which the foreskin is removed. In common speech, someone who has been circumcised is described as cut while someone who is not is described as uncut . For example, one teenaged boy might ask another teenaged boy, "Are you cut?" While this is slang English, it is not considered profanity.
Circumcision may be done by a doctor using a surgical tool, such as scissors, a plastic tool called a plastibell device, or it may be done with a laser . If the doctor uses a laser there is almost no bleeding. [1]
Circumcision may be a religious ritual , a custom in certain tribes or countries, or a medical practice.
Reasons for performing a circumcision:
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloth_facemask
A cloth facemask is a face covering which is used to cover the mouth and nose . As the name suggests, these masks are made of textiles . Cotton is commonly used. Starting with the 19th century, such masks have been used by healthcare professionals. They are also used to protect against air pollution , although they may not be very effective in protecting against air pollution. [1] [2] [3]
Depending on the design, they can be effective stopping the transmission of disease spread by droplets of liquid . Today, healthcare professionals often use surgical masks or respirators , which offer better protection. A study done in 2010 found that 40 to 90 percent of particles pass through a cloth facemask. [4]
Cloth face masks are commonly used during the COVID-19 pandemic , especially when surgical and other medical face coverings are not available. [5] [6]
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjoined_twins
' Conjoined twins are twins whose bodies are joined together at birth. This happens where the zygote of identical twins fails to completely separate. Conjoined twins occur in an estimated one in 200,000 births, and approximately half are stillborn . The overall survival rate for conjoined twins is between 5% and 25%. Conjoined twins are more likely to be female (70-75%). Daisy and Violet Hilton are a famous pair of conjoined twins. They were born in Brighton and were kept on top of the Evening Star pub, where they were taught to dance by a cruel barmaid. She then sold them and they toured Vaudeville. They became famous in the movie Freaks and lived long lives, eventually getting married.
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coprolalia
Coprolalia is a condition that affects about 15% of people with Tourette syndrome .  Someone with coprolalia will use words that make people feel uncomfortable so often that it is hard to control. This is often in the form of a stream of curse words.
People who have Tourette syndrome are not the only people who experience coprolalia. For example, it can happen in people who have had a stroke , [1] or who have schizophrenia . [2]

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coprophagia
Coprophagia is the eating of faeces . Many animals eat faeces, either their own or that of other animal groups. It is particularly common in dogs and puppies of about six months old, but little is known why; lack of stimulus and variety in the lifestyle or diet have been cited as potential reasons. Adding pineapple to their food is  a well recognized solution for many dogs. Humans do it only on rare occasions and it is looked down upon in society.  Eating one's feces can also spread disease.

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_vaccine
A COVID-19 vaccine is any of the vaccines used against the Coronavirus Disease 2019 ( COVID-19 pandemic ). In July 2020, more than 150 vaccines were being developed in different laboratories. [1] Two mRNA vaccines , one by Pfizer and one by Moderna , were approved late in 2020. Both are over 90% effective. [2] A few vaccines also went into use in early 2021.
Several countries plan to give the vaccine to many people, but their plans are different. The United Kingdom plans to use its National Health Service .  Canada plans to use its military. The United States plans to send vaccines to all fifty states and then let the state governments each make their own system. [3]
The United Kingdom approved the Pfizer vaccine before the European Union or United States did. They began giving it to people on December 8. [4] The United States began giving people the vaccine on December 14, starting with health care workers in New York City . [5] By April 2021, several vaccines were in use around the world and hundreds of millions of people had been vaccinated.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect a vaccine against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative virus, to become available in less than 18 months. [6] The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) – which is organizing a US$2 billion worldwide fund for fast investment and creation of vaccine candidates [7] – indicated in April that a vaccine may be available under emergency use protocols in less than 12 months or by early 2021. [8] On 4 May 2020, the WHO organized a telethon (fundraising event broadcasted via televisions) to raise US$8 billion from forty countries to support rapid development of vaccines to prevent COVID-19 infections and deaths. [9] The United States government started Operation Warp Speed to develop a vaccine by January 2021. [1]
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detoxification
Detoxification is when any toxic thing is removed from the human body, for example alcohol or poison. [1] A healthy lifestyle along with regular exercise can help you to remove toxins from the body. [ source? ]
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distress_(medicine)
In medicine , distress is a situation when a person is unable to completely adapt to stress . As a result, the person shows a set of behaviours which are not adapted to the situation. Very often, the person is aware of the situation, and feels bad about not being able to fully adapt.
People often find ways of dealing with distress, in both negative and positive ways. Examples of positive ways are listening to music, calming exercises, sports and similar healthy distractions. Negative ways can include but are not limited to use of drugs including alcohol, and expression of anger, which are likely to lead to complicated social interactions, thus causing increased distress.
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Dix
Adrian Dix (born April 20, 1964) is a Canadian politician . He is a member of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia and the Minister of Health of British Columbia , Canada . He was also the leader of the British Columbia New Democratic Party from 2011 to 2014. [1]
Dix was first elected to the Legislative Assembly in the 2005 provincial election . He led the BC NDP into the 2013 provincial election . Even though opinion polling showed that he would win the election, he lost the election to the BC Liberal Party . Because of this, he resigned as the leader of the BC NDP. [2]
Dix was first elected to the Legislative Assembly in the 2005 provincial election. He was elected to the electoral district of Vancouver-Kingsway . He beat the incumbent Liberal MLA Rob Nijjar . [3]
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyslipidemia
Dislipidemia is the condition of having too much much lipids (essentially: fat ) in the bloodstream . The main treatmeent consists in lowering the amount of cholesterol . In most cases, this is done with a change of the diet and the lifestyle . In some cases, drugs are used to help. There are several cases, where dislipidemia is caused by a birth defect . Other conditions affecting dyslipidemia is being overweight , or an unbalanced nutrition . Many diseases of the liver , or the thyroid gland can cause dyslipidemia. Another disease that can cause dyslipidemia is Diabetes mellitus .
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroconvulsive_therapy
Electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT ), also called electroshock , is a psychiatric treatment in which seizures are caused by electricity in unconscious patients to treat llness.
The process is completed by placing electrodes on the sides of the patient's head (on either both or just one side) and sending a small electric current through the brain. This lasts for about half a second.
The patient is also made unconscious before the treatment for safety reasons. The therapy without informed consent is medical abuse and Article 18 of the Yogyakarta Principles prohibit to "care" any sexual orientation and gender identity though any therapy including this.

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabethan_collar
An Elizabethan collar , also called a, e-collar , lampshade or cone of shame is a piece of equipment used in veterinary medicine . [1] They stop the animal from licking or biting its body and from scratching or touching its head with its feet. [2]
The veterinarian places the collar around the neck of an injured animal so that it cannot bite or lick the injured part of its body.  For example, a dog with a cut on its skin might need medicine placed directly on the cut. The dog might try to lick the medicine and poison itself.  An animal that has had surgery might try to pull out its stitches .  An animal with a broken leg might bite into its cast and try to pull it off.  If it is wearing an Elizabethan collar, it cannot do this.
Some pet owners say their pets find it difficult to eat, drink and play while wearing an Elizabethan collar. [2] Veterinarians sometimes try other collars, like those made out of cloth, collars that look like inner-tube-shaped cushions, and collars that act more like a neck brace , stopping the animal from moving its head. [3]
Elizabethan collars are named after Elizabethan ruffs , stiff, starched collars that people wore in 1500s England.
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equilibrioception
Equilibrioception is the sense of balance . This is what prevents a person or animal from falling over while walking or doing other physical activity.
In humans, equilibrioception is mainly sensed by the detection of acceleration, which occurs in the vestibular system . Other senses play roles as well, e.g. the visual system and proprioception . The importance of visual input for balance is illustrated by its being harder to stand on one foot with eyes closed than with eyes open.
The sense of balance often gets worse as a person ages . After a stroke , it may be improved with the help of special training. [1]
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eustress
Eustress is positive or good stress . It is the opposite of distress. Eustress is the positive stress that a person gets from riding a roller coaster , or a high speed bike, or singing in front of an audience. People may feel very good afterwards if they experience eustress.
People often have the same physical reactions (sweating, trembling, shivering, etc.) for both eustress and distress.

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue
Fatigue or tiredness is a physical or mental feeling. It happens when someone is ready to sleep or has done a lot of physical exercise . The person may feel weak, slow or sleepy. They may yawn , and may find it difficult to keep the eyes open. Usual fatigue goes away when you rest or sleep.
Fatigue may also be caused by physical or mental illness , jet lag , drug or alcohol use, medications , blood loss , malnutrition , starvation, stress or boredom .

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female_genital_mutilation

Female genital mutilation ( FGM ) is cutting off part or all of the female genitals that are outside of the body.  FGM is also called female genital cutting and female circumcision .  It is done for traditional reasons, as part of a ritual , not for medical reasons.
FGM is most common in 27 African countries, as well as Yemen and Iraqi Kurdistan .  However, it also happens in other countries in Asia , the Middle East and around the world. [5] Usually, FGM is not done by a doctor or in a hospital . [6] It is often done with a razor blade or other sharp instruments, in many cases without anesthesia .
Different ethnic groups do different kinds of FGM. They also do FGM at different ages.  Some groups do FGM when infants are only a few days old.  Others do it when girls reach puberty , or are older.  In about half the countries where FGM happens, most girls have FGM before they are five years old. [4]
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_aid
First aid is promptly helping people who are suddenly sick ( illnesses ) or hurt ( injuries or body damage).  For example, first aid is used at accident s to help an injured person until they receive medical treatment (help by doctors , nurses or ambulances ).  First aid is also used to help people who suddenly become sick, until help arrives or they can be taken to medical care.
A person does not need much equipment to give first aid. A package of things useful to give first aid is called a first aid kit . Lives can be saved even without a first aid kit. What is required is basic knowledge. First aid can be done just about anywhere that an emergency requires. In places far from hospitals , first aid may be the only help possible until the person can be taken to a hospital or clinic .
Emergency medical dispatchers are trained in first aid, so that if there is an emergency, they can give the caller some information on what to do until the ambulance arrives.  This can include the "C-A-B" listed below.
First aid skills are kept simple on purpose so that people can remember and use them in an emergency to save at least one life.

First aid kits are used to perform first aid on injured people.
A first aid kit often contains the following items:


https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateway_drug_theory
Gateway drug theory is the idea that once a person uses one illegal drug , they are more likely to use other drugs.  It is also called stepping-stone theory , escalation hypothesis , or progression hypothesis.
If the gateway theory is true, people who use one drug may be more likely to use other drugs because:
The gateway theory helps shape education and lawmaking about drugs. Scientific study of the possible causes of the gateway theory is important for health policy. [1]
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination
A hallucination is seeing, hearing, tasting, smelling or feeling things that do not really exist. Usually people have to be awake and conscious to have hallucinations. That way, a person who sees or hears something that is not really there has a hallucination. Hallucinations are different from dreams . When people dream they are not awake. Hallucinations are also different from illusions . Illusions are based on real perceptions, which are distorted or interpreted in a wrong way.
Certain drugs can cause hallucinations. Some illegal drugs are taken because they cause hallucinations. Certain mental illnesses can also cause hallucinations. In some cases, withdrawal of a drug can also cause hallucinations. This has especially been reported by people trying to stop taking sleeping pills , or by alcoholics .
People who have hallucinations are not necessarily ill, lack of sleep can also cause hallucinations. Hallucinations just before going to sleep or just after waking up are considered normal.
Hallucinations can affect all of a person's senses . People with the mental illness of schizophrenia may hear sounds or voices that are not really there. People with certain mental illnesses may also have hallucinations in which they see a person or thing which is not really there. People are less likely to have hallucinations in which they smell or touch something that is not really there. Certain forms of epilepsy can cause hallucinations. Finally, hallucinations can be the result of certain substances taken or of certain physical constellations. Most of the time, these substances are taken to get the hallucinations. Sometimes, (severe) lack of sleep , or high fever can lead to hallucinations brought on by such viruses as the common cold .
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_-MIT_Program_in_Health_Sciences_and_Technology
Harvard–MIT Program in Health Sciences and Technology , or HST , is a biomedical engineering and physician-scientist training programs in the United States . It was established in 1970 and is the collaborative program between Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Within the program, graduate and medical students are registered with both MIT and Harvard and work with faculty and affiliated faculty members from both communities. HST is a part of MIT's Institute for Medical Engineering and Science and forms the London Society at Harvard Medical School. [1] [2]
HST's program aims to bring engineering , physical sciences, and biological sciences from the laboratory bench to the patient's bedside. Similarly, it also aims to bring clinical insight from the patient's bedside to the laboratory bench. Consequently, HST students are trained to have a deep and exposure in understanding of engineering and scientific fundamentals that complement with hands-on experience in the clinic or in industry.
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing
Healing is a process that happens in the body . Through healing, cells are able to repair damaged tissue .
There are two different ways healing can happen:
Most healing processes combine both ways of healing.

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiccups
The hiccups (hik-ups) are a discomfort in which one randomly gasps due to bubbles in the diaphragm . This is not a disease but a temporary discomfort, although hiccups can last as long as years.

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_microbiome
The human microbiome (or human microbiota ) is the collection of microorganisms which live on us. They live on the skin, in the saliva and mouth, in the eyes, and in the gut and the rest of the gastrointestinal tract . They include bacteria , archaea , fungi and single- celled eukaryotes (' protozoa '). [1] Everyone carries around far more of these microbes than the number of human cells in the body. The human body has about 100 trillion cells , and carries about ten times as many microorganisms in the intestines alone . [2] [3] [4] [5]
The microbiome is "the ecological community of commensal , symbiotic , and pathogenic microorganisms that literally share our body space". [6] [7] The term was originally coined by Joshua Lederberg . He thought the microorganisms living in the human body in health and disease were important. Many scientific articles distinguish "microbiome" and " microbiota " to describe either the collective genomes of the microorganisms that live in an environmental niche or the microorganisms themselves, respectively. [8] [9] [10] However, by the original definitions these terms are largely synonymous .
Some of these organisms are useful for humans. However, most have no known effect. They are just symbionts : they live with us. Those which are expected to be present are members of the normal flora . Under normal circumstances they do not cause disease, but may even help our health. Studies in 2009 asked whether our health is damaged if we reduce this biota. [11] This is certainly the case with gut flora . [3]
Although "flora" refers to plants rather than bacteria, the term 'gut flora' is widely used and familiar to biologists. ' Biota ' refers to the total collection of organisms in an ecosystem . The term 'microbiota' is best for bacteria and other microorganisms, but no doubt 'flora' will often be used.
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertrophy
In biology, hypertrophy is the increase in size of an organ , beyond normal growth. Hypertrophy happens because the cells grow bigger. The condition where an organ is bigger, because there are more cells is called hyperplasia .
Some cells like adipocytes (fat cells) get larger by expanding outward while filling up with more lipid contents, while myocytes (muscle cells) can fuse with other myocytes to form huge myotube cells. Organs or tissues can grow larger due to the enlargement of their component cells . One of the most common and visible forms of normal, organ hypertrophy occurs in skeletal muscles in response to strength training or bodybuilding .
In contrast, tissues and organs can also get larger by another mechanism, hyperplasia, in which the cells remain approximately the same size but increase in number . Although hypertrophy and hyperplasia are two distinct processes, they frequently occur together. The hormonally -induced proliferation and enlargement of the cells of the uterus during pregnancy is an example of this combination under normal conditions. In some tumors, enlargement can occur by an increase in the number of cells together with the occurrence of some abnormally large cells.
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_health
International health means two different, but related, things. It means care of people who travel from one country to another, and knowledge of diseases foreign to the traveler. [1] It also means people from one country trying to improve health in another.
There are different kinds of groups that are involved in international health. They engage in international health for different reasons and with different ethics and rules.
Governments of rich, "developed" countries are often interested in the health of other countries. They are especially interested in the health of neighbor countries. The reasons for this are many: if they have extra resources, they may want to share them with their neighbors; but also they may want to stop spread of diseases from their neighbor country across the border. For example, the United States is a richer country than Mexico and has little problem with measles (in children) or rabies (in mammals ) in the interior, but along the border with Mexico these diseases are more common.
The Western Hemisphere 's countries have formed PAHO, the Pan American Health Organization, to deal with these kinds of problems  in an organized way. PAHO knows that people and goods flow across borders in both directions, and a problem in one country will soon be a problem in its partner countries. PAHO is an example of an international organization .
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intoxication
Intoxication is the state of being affected by one or more psychoactive drugs . It can also refer to the effects caused by the ingestion of poison or by the overconsumption of normally harmless substances.
People who drink too much alcohol become intoxicated. [1] They may become impaired in some or all of their senses like touch or even eyesight. Long term drinkers develop tolerance to alcohol. This high tolerance means it takes more alcohol to produce the outward signs of intoxication. [2] Intoxication may bring delirium or make people do or say things that are not normal for them. The level of harm done usually depends on the substance and the amount. Mild intoxication usually is not permanently harmful. Mild stimulants like caffeine usually do not harm the person.
Some types of intoxication:
Intoxication can cause a state of mind that remains once the person is no longer intoxicated that can be used as a legal defense:
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massage
Massages refer to rubbing a particular place on the body . They are often performed when a certain part of the human body is injured, strained or in cramps. Massages are often performed on human feet , backs and arms , but can be done on many parts of the body.
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_diet
The Mediterranean diet is a way of eating.  The Mediterranean diet is not only food.  It is also the skills and traditions people use to make it, for example farming, fishing, and cooking.  It is also the traditions and culture about food and meals. [1]
In the second half of the 20th century, people far from the Mediterranean Sea began to eat a Mediterranean diet to become healthier.  In 2019, U.S. News and World Report named the Mediterranean diet "Best Overall Diet." [2] [3]
A scientist named Ancel Keys started studying the Mediterranean diet in the 1950s.  He saw that people in poor Italian villages were healthier than people in New York . [3]
In 2013, the United Nations declared the Mediterranean diet intangible cultural heritage from Cyprus , Croatia , Spain , Greece , Italy , Morocco and Portugal . [1]
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_capacity
Mental capacity in law is a term used to describe a person's ability to make decisions for themselves and to understand what those decisions will mean for them.
Sometimes, people who are unwell, such as those with illnesses which affect their memory ( Alzheimer's disease or Dementia ), those with learning difficulties , or who have mental health problems, may find themselves in a position where their ability to make decisions for themselves is questioned.  This may be because they do not understand that what they are doing is not good for them; they do not realise that it might make them ill or get them into trouble.
People can also lack capacity if they are unable to communicate in any way; for example, if they're in a coma or if they have severe brain damage .  In this case, it may be necessary for someone else, such as an advocate or a Judge to make decisions for them by making a court order .
In some countries, like the United Kingdom , laws exist which tell those working with people whose capacity might be in doubt, what they must do and how to decide if someone is capable of making their own decisions.  In the UK, this law is called the Mental Capacity Act (2005). [1] It lists 5 rules which must be used as a guide; in simple terms, they are:

Muteness means not being able to speak. A person that can not speak using sound is called a mute . It is a type of speech  disorder . A person who chooses not to speak can also be said to be mute.

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutilation
Mutilation is when the way a human body looks is permanently changed. This change may be due to an accident , or it may be the result of torture .
Losing a part of the body (like a hand), or permanent scars (different looking skin after a bad injury heals) on the body, might be a result of mutilation.
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebulizer
Nebuliser is a medical instrument or device which is used give extra supply of air to the persons suffering from Asthma or any having any breathing problems to breathe in properly.
It is also used for the patients with runny nose or nasal stroke.
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocturnal_enuresis
Nocturnal enuresis , also called bedwetting , is a health issue that is often caused by or the symptom of certain health troubles. It happens when a person involuntarily urinates while she is asleep .

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_Safety_and_Health
Occupational Safety and Health is a set of laws that have been made to protect the health and the safety of people when they are working.  Health and safety rules will vary a lot from one country to another.  Some countries have very strict rules.  Rules about Health and Safety have been made since 1950 when the International Labour Organization (ILO) and the World Health Organization (WHO) agreed about standards of health in the workplace.
Health and safety laws will deal with such things as: the temperature in the workplace (it must not be too hot or too cold), things on the floor that people could fall over, or things that could catch on their clothing and cause an accident, smoking in the workplace and other things that might cause pollution or which might be fire hazards, how many toilets per person there should be, whether they need safety equipment (e.g. hard hats in case anything falls on their heads), whether it is safe for a person to be left alone in the workplace, the rights of disabled people , how many hours in the day people can work for etc.
Businesses that do not obey health and safety regulations may be punished (e.g. with a fine or forced to close), or they may be held responsible if there is an accident.
In the European Union , member states have authorities which make sure that people obey the health and safety laws.  In the UK , health and safety legislation is made by the Health and Safety Executive and local authorities (the local council) under the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 . [1]
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega-3_fatty_acid
Omega-3 fatty acids are polyunsaturated fatty acids. They have a double bond three atoms away from the end methyl group.
The most common sources for plant oils are walnuts , hemp oil and flaxseed oil . Sources of animal omega-3 fats include eggs , squid oils and fish .
Dietary supplementation does not affect the risk of cancer , heart disease or death . [1]
They are not a main treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism and other developmental disabilities . However, omega-3 supplements are often given to children with these conditions. [2]
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega-6_fatty_acid
Omega-6 fatty acids are a family of polyunsaturated fatty acids .
Some medical research notes that high levels of omega-6 fatty acids from seed oils may increase the chance for a number of diseases . [1] However, having non-rancid nuts , which are high in omega-6, is associated with lower risk for some diseases, including cardiovascular diseases , stroke , heart attacks and certain cancers . [2]
Modern Western diets often have ratios of omega-6 to omega 3 higher than 10. Some are as high as 30. The normal ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 in the Western diet is 15–16.7, mainly from vegetable oils . [3]
Vegetable oils are a major source of omega-6 linoleic acid. Worldwide, more than 100 million metric tons of vegetable oils are extracted annually from palm fruits , soybean seeds , rape seeds , and sunflower seeds , providing more than 32 million metric tons of omega-6 linoleic acid and 4 million metric tons of omega-3 alpha-linolenic acid. [4] [5]
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteopathy
Osteopathy is a philosophy that refers to the ability of the human body to heal itself.
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poison
Poisons are substances which cause death or injury when taken in by a living thing . [1] [2] It may be taken in as drink or food, or absorbed through the skin. The damage is usually done by a chemical reaction . The effect of the poison varies with the amount which is absorbed (taken in or inhaled). Substances which are poisonous are called toxic , but any substance can be toxic if too much of it is consumed. If poisoning causes death, it is lethal poison.
Legally, and in hazardous chemical labeling, poisons are especially toxic substances. Less toxic substances are labeled "harmful", "irritant", or not labeled at all.
In medicine and zoology , toxins and venoms are different from poisons. Toxins are the result of a biological process. Venoms are substances which the organism uses to harm other species . Certain organisms use venoms for hunting, or as a defense. If an organism is poisonous , such as many mushrooms, it is harmful to eat. If it is venomous , like snakes or honeybees, it has a harmful bite or sting. For some very deadly bites humans have developed effective antivenoms .
Often it is only the quantity of a substance that makes the difference. Drinking alcoholic drinks may lead to aggressive behaviour, problems with speech, and different forms of amnesia . This effect is called intoxication . People who drink even more may go into shock .  At the same time, alcohol can be used as a disinfectant .
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_food
Foods are raw when they are not cooked . 
Most things are good to eat raw, but some can be poisonous.
There's currently no solid evidence to suggest that raw food is more healthy than cooked food.
Raw food can sometimes make people sick because of bacteria which would otherwise be destroyed by cooking.
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ritual_purification
Ritual purification is the ritual prescribed by a religion by which a person is considered to be free of uncleanliness . Many religgions require that those worshipping should be in this state. Ritual purity is a state of ritual cleanliness . Ritual purification may also apply to objects and places. Ritual uncleanliness is not identical with ordinary physical impurity, such as dirt stains; nevertheless, body fluids are generally considered ritually unclean.
Most of these rituals existed long before the germ theory of disease , and figure prominently from the earliest known religious systems of the Ancient Near East . Some writers connect the rituals to taboos .
Some have seen benefits of these practices for health and preventing infections especially in areas where humans come in close contact with each other.  While these practices came before the idea of the germ theory was public in areas that use daily cleaning, the destruction of infectious agents seems to be dramatic. [1] Others have described a 'dimension of purity' that is universal in religions that seeks to move us away from disgust, (at one extreme) and to uplift us towards purity and divinity (at the other extreme). Away from uncleanliness to purity, and away from deviant to moral behavior, (within one's cultural context). [2]
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_vaccine
Messenger RNA vaccines or mRNA vaccines is a type of vaccine that protect the body from certain viruses .  Some mRNA vaccines help the body kill cancer . [1] [2] Like all vaccines , mRNA vaccines increase the body's immunity so the patient is less likely to catch an infectious disease .
Almost all cells make and use their own mRNA.  They use it to make proteins.  Each mRNA is like a blueprint or recipe for one kind of protein.
Most vaccines work by taking something from a harmful germ and putting it inside the patient's body without any parts of the germ that cause harm.  Then the patient's own cells learn to identify the germ using its other parts.  Then, if a living germ ever attacks the body, the patient's cells fight it off without having to learn what it is first.  Some vaccines do this by putting a dead, weak germ inside the patient's body.  Other vaccines do this by putting lots of proteins that the germ makes inside the body but not any germs themselves.  mRNA vaccines work by putting mRNA inside the body instead of protein.  Then the body uses the mRNA to make protein itself.
mRNA vaccines can be injected into the skin or muscle with a needle. [2] Some mRNA vaccines can be inhaled into the patient's nose.  Anti-cancer mRNA vaccines can be injected into the tumor.
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturated_fat
Saturated fat is a kind of fat . It has no double bonds . It has carbon atoms that are fully saturated with hydrogen . Saturated fats are usually solid at room temperature. They have no double bonds, while unsaturated fat has one or two. Due to no double bonds, their oxidation process is slow. [1]
Is saturated fat a risk factor for heart disease (CVD)? This is a question with many controversial views. [2] Although most in the mainstream heart-health, government, and medical communities hold that saturated fat is a risk factor for CVD, some recent studies have produced conflicting results.
For a long time scientists have believed that eating saturated fat was a leading cause for heart attack, cancer, or other diseases. However, new research have shown that there is no connection between how much saturated fat you eat and heart diseases. [2] [3] [4] This is still a controversial question.
Things like butter , coconut , lard and meat have lots of saturated fat.
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauna
A sauna is a small room or building that is made hot. The heat of a sauna is calming and makes the person using it sweat . This is believed to help people be more healthy though it causes stress on the body by overheating. Today many countries and groups of people have different ways of heating and using a sauna. The temperature is often 80° C in Finnish saunas. The heat can be more than 100°C. Finnish and Swedish saunas have lower humidity (the air is less wet ) to make this high heat comfortable.
The Turkish hammam has a high humidity (the air is more wet) and a lower temperature.
Today saunas can often be found at hotels and places for sports and exercise . In Finland, they are more common and are also often in private apartments and office buildings .
In almost every house in Finland they have a sauna.
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_and_rescue
Search and rescue is when people look for a person who is lost or in danger. It is usually carried by ships , helicopters , or land vehicles that are specially equipped. Most of these missions take place at sea or in the mountains . Search and rescue missions are performed by civilian and military rescuers, such as police or firefighters .
Combat search and rescue is a military variant performed by special forces like the United States Navy SEALs on the battlefield.

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)
Stress is a word used in biology and medicine to describe changes that can be seen in organisms . Stress can be physical or mental. Stress can describe a pressure , like the pressure of a person's upper teeth on their lower teeth while chewing. Stress can also describe an impact, when one object hits another.
Stress describes a living thing's response to a threat or some other change in its environment . This change can be called a "stressor." Stressors can vary in size and impact. A stressor can be internal and come from inside the living thing - like an illness. [1] A stressor can be external, coming from outside the living thing - like an attack.
There are different types of stress. Each type has different characteristics and symptoms.
Organisms can respond to stress in different ways.
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_management
Stress management is the name for a number of techniques to control the level of psychical stress situations. It is usually done to impove  everyday functioning. Stress produces many physical and mental symptoms which are different in every individual situation. Stress can make physical health worse, and it can lead to clinical depression .   The process of stress management is named as one of the keys to a happy and successful life in modern society Although life provides numerous demands that can prove difficult to handle, stress management provides a number of ways to manage anxiety and maintain overall well-being.
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_mask
A surgical mask , also known as a procedure mask , medical mask or simply as a face mask , [1] [2] is a  mask. It is intended to be worn by health professionals during surgery and during nursing . Such masks are used to catch the bacteria shed in liquid droplets and aerosol s from the wearer's mouth and nose. They are not designed to protect the wearer from inhaling airborne bacteria or virus particles and are less effective than respirators , which provide better protection.
There are different qualities of such mask. Despite their name, not all surgical masks should be used during surgeries. Chinese health officials distinguish between medical (non-surgical) and surgical masks. [3]
Surgical masks are made of a nonwoven fabric created using a melt blowing process.  They came into use in the 1960s and largely replaced cloth facemasks in developed countries .  A shortage of surgical masks is a central issue of the ongoing 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic . [4] [5]
Surgical masks are popularly worn by the general public all year round in East Asian countries like China , Japan and South Korea to reduce the chance of spreading airborne diseases to others, and to prevent the breathing in of airborne dust particles created by air pollution . [6] Additionally, surgical masks have become a fashion statement, particularly in contemporary East Asian culture bolstered by its popularity in Japanese and Korean pop culture which have a big impact on East Asian youth culture . [7] [8]
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacuinum_sanitatis
The Tacuinum (sometimes Taccuinum ) Sanitatis [1] is a medieval handbook mainly on health . It is based on the Taqwim al‑sihha تقويم الصحة ("Maintenance of Health"), an eleventh-century Arab work an health by Ibn Butlan of Baghdad . [2] The text exists in several variant Latin versions .
It describes in detail the beneficial and harmful properties of foods and plants . It explains the six essential elements for well-being :
Tacuinum Sanitatis says that illnesses result from imbalance of these elements.
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirst
Thirst is the need to drink water or some other liquid . People can survive quite a while without food, but without something to drink they die very quickly. See dehydration .

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(biology)
A vector in biology is an animal on or in which a small living thing gets transported . The vector gets no benefit and sometimes loses fitness by the arrangement.
The term is most used for the transport of parasites and agents of disease . So, deadly diseases, such as malaria and dengue fever , are carried by some mosquitoes .
The study of vectors gives us knowledge about the life cycle of parasitic diseases, and this helps us control those diseases.
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinary_medicine
Veterinary medicine is a branch of medicine that deals with the health of animals . It is the study and practice of preventing, diagnosing and treating disease and injuries in animals. Veterinary medicine covers all species of animals, including both domesticated animals and wild animals.
People who study and practice veterinary medicine professionally are called veterinarians (often known as "vets").
Veterinary science tries to help human health by monitoring and controlling zoonotic diseases ( infectious diseases transmitted from animals to humans).

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_loss
Weight loss is when a person weighs less than before. A person can lose weight by running , swimming or doing any other activity. Also, a person might eat a healthier diet to lose weight. There are many diet and exercises programs available to lose weight. Many people lose weight when they eat less sugar and more vegetables , fruits and lean meat .
In many countries weight loss is caused by sociological pressure mostly on woman to have slim and fit figure.
Unintentional weight loss is when a person loses weight without trying. It can be a symptom of some types of cancer . [2] Stress can cause unintentional weight loss. [3] Stress can come from divorce , changing jobs or over the loss of a loved one. [3] Once the stress is removed and the person feels happier again, the weight may return to normal. [3] Depression may also cause weight loss. Eating disorders such as anorexia or bulimia can cause significant weight loss. [3] These disorders usually require the help of health care professionals . [3]
Getting enough sleep helps to avoid gaining excess weight. [4] Over time, getting more sleep can help a person to lose weight. [4] The main reason is not getting enough sleep leaves a person tired during the day and prone to eating more food. [4] Getting enough sleep helps in maintaining healthy eating habits.
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yo-yo_effect
The Yo-yo effect means people quickly gaining weight after a diet . Other words for this activity are yo-yo dieting or weight cycling . People's weight can move down and back up like a yo-yo when they follow several diets one after another. A person's weight after the diet is often higher than it was before dieting.
The steps to the weight cycle are normal eating, weight gain, diet, metabolism slow-down, and end of the diet. But they repeat again and that’s the Yo-Yo effect. For example, Sherman Morrison talks about someone on the website healevate.com, saying, “In the 1990’s she got up to 237 pounds, dropped it back down to 160 in the early 2000’s, but then crept back up over 200. Recently, however, she shed 30 pounds using Weight Watchers.” Which means she first gained weight, then she lost weight, and finally she gained it back. Basically, Morrison is describing that the Yo-Yo effect is gaining and losing weight over and over again. [1]
The body needs less energy after losing weight on a diet. People have less fatty tissue and often less muscle after the diet. Muscle tissue needs more energy than fatty tissue. Reducing the amount of muscle tissue therefore reduces the need for energy. Also, limit the number of calories people take in. At some point, a dieter's body will change the way it uses energy if there are less calories to burn. The body does this to make sure it survives when less food is available. These changes in the body cause people to gain weight rapidly when they stop dieting and return to their old eating habits.
People can avoid the yo-yo effect by changing their diet. If a diet works without the body switching to a more efficient way of using calories, there will be no yo-yo effect. A diet should change the dieter's eating habits for a long time. New eating habits should not give the body more energy than it needs. At the end of the diet, it also makes sense to raise the number of calories someone eats slowly. Exercise and sports can increase the amount of calories burned by the body rather than turned into fat.
