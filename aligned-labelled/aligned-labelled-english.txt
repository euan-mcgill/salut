https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome_coronavirus_2  Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS‑CoV‑2 ) [2] is the virus that causes COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), the respiratory illness responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic . [3] Also colloquially known simply as the coronavirus , it was previously referred to by its provisional name , 2019 novel coronavirus ( 2019-nCoV ), [4] [5] [6] [7] and has also been called human coronavirus 2019 ( HCoV-19 or hCoV-19 ). [8] [9] [10] [11] The World Health Organization declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020, and a pandemic on 11 March 2020. [12] [13] SARS‑CoV‑2 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus [14] that is contagious in humans. [15] As described by the US National Institutes of Health , it is the successor to SARS-CoV-1 , the virus that caused the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak . [16] SARS‑CoV‑2 is a virus of the species severe acute respiratory syndrome–related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV). [2] It is believed to have zoonotic origins and has close genetic similarity to bat coronaviruses, suggesting it emerged from a bat-borne virus . [9] [17] Research is ongoing as to whether SARS‑CoV‑2 came directly from bats or indirectly through any intermediate hosts. [18] The virus shows little genetic diversity , indicating that the spillover event introducing SARS‑CoV‑2 to humans is likely to have occurred in late 2019. [19] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_stock_market_crash  The 2020 stock market crash was a major and sudden global stock market crash that began on 20 February 2020 and ended on 7 April. Beginning on 13 May 2019, the yield curve on U.S. Treasury securities inverted , [1] and remained so until 11 October 2019, when it reverted to normal . [2] Through 2019, while some economists (including Campbell Harvey and former New York Federal Reserve economist Arturo Estrella) argued that a recession in the following year was likely, [3] [4] other economists (including the managing director of Wells Fargo Securities Michael Schumacher and San Francisco Federal Reserve President Mary C. Daly ) argued that inverted yield curves may no longer be a reliable recession predictor. [5] [2] The yield curve on U.S. Treasuries would not invert again until 30 January 2020 when the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern , [6] [7] four weeks after local health commission officials in Wuhan , China announced the first 27 COVID-19 cases as a viral pneumonia strain outbreak on 1 January . [8] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/501.V2_variant  Lineage B.1.351 [a] is a variant of SARS-CoV-2 , the virus that causes COVID-19 . One of several SARS-CoV-2 variants believed to be of particular importance , it was first detected in the Nelson Mandela Bay [5] metropolitan area of the Eastern Cape province of South Africa in October 2020, [6] which was reported by the country's health department on 18 December 2020. [7] Phylogeographic analysis suggests this variant emerged in the Nelson Mandela Bay already in July or August 2020. [8] A genomics team lead by the KwaZulu-Natal Research Innovation and Sequencing Platform (KRISP) at the University of KwaZulu-Natal discovered the new variant. [9] It was uncovered by whole genome sequencing . Several genomic sequences from this lineage were submitted to the GISAID sequence database.

[8] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus  Coronaviruses are a group of related RNA viruses that cause diseases in mammals and birds . In humans and birds, they cause respiratory tract infections that can range from mild to lethal. Mild illnesses in humans include some cases of the common cold (which is also caused by other viruses , predominantly rhinoviruses ), while more lethal varieties can cause SARS , MERS , and COVID-19 . In cows and pigs they cause diarrhea , while in mice they cause hepatitis and encephalomyelitis . Coronaviruses constitute the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae , in the family Coronaviridae , order Nidovirales , and realm Riboviria . [4] [5] They are enveloped viruses with a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome and a nucleocapsid of helical symmetry. [6] The genome size of coronaviruses ranges from approximately 26 to 32 kilobases , one of the largest among RNA viruses. [7] They have characteristic club-shaped spikes that project from their surface, which in electron micrographs create an image reminiscent of the solar corona , from which their name derives. [8] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVAX  COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access , abbreviated as COVAX , is a worldwide initiative aimed at equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines directed by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance (formerly the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization, or GAVI),  the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), and the World Health Organization (WHO).  It is one of the three pillars of the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator , an initiative begun in April 2020 by the WHO, the European Commission , and the government of France as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic . COVAX coordinates international resources to enable low-to-middle-income countries equitable access to COVID-19 tests , therapies , and vaccines . [1] By 15 July 2020, 165 countries – representing 60% of the human population – had joined COVAX. [2] However, as of 11 April 2021, COVAX is falling short of its goal, having delivered 38.5 million doses despite a goal of 100 million by the end of March. [3] [4] As of 9 May 2021, the WHO has approved the Oxford–AstraZeneca , the Pfizer–BioNTech , the Moderna as well as the Sinopharm BBIBP-CorV and Johnson & Johnson vaccines for emergency use. [5] These vaccines can be distributed as part of COVAX. [5] [6] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_Advisory_Board  The COVID-19 Advisory Board was announced in November 2020 by then- President-elect of the United States Joe Biden as part of his presidential transition . It was co-chaired by physicians David A. Kessler , Marcella Nunez-Smith , and Vivek Murthy and comprises 13 health experts. The board was then succeeded by the White House COVID-19 Response Team upon Biden's presidency. Before naming any White House staff or cabinet appointments, Biden announced that he will appoint a COVID-19 task force, co-chaired by former Surgeon General Vivek Murthy , former Food and Drug Administration Commissioner David Kessler and Yale University epidemiologist Professor Marcella Nunez-Smith . [3] [4] In November 2020, he announced the names of 13 health experts to serve on the COVID-19 Advisory Board. [5] Biden pledged a more and larger federal government response to the pandemic than Donald Trump , akin to President Franklin D. Roosevelt 's New Deal during the Great Depression . [6] This would include increased testing for SARS-CoV-2 , a steady supply of personal protective equipment , distributing a vaccine and securing money from Congress for schools and hospitals under the aegis of a national "supply chain commander" who would coordinate the logistics of manufacturing and distributing protective gear and test kits. This would be distributed by a "Pandemic Testing Board", also similar to Roosevelt's War Production Board during World War II . [6] Biden also pledged to invoke the Defense Production Act more aggressively than Trump in order to build up supplies, as well as the mobilization of up to 100,000 Americans for a "public health jobs corps" of contact tracers to help track and prevent outbreaks. [6] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_lockdowns  2020 2021 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic  The COVID-19 pandemic , also known as the coronavirus pandemic , is an ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan , China . The World Health Organization declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern regarding COVID-19 on 30 January 2020, and later declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020. As of 1 June 2021, more than 170 million cases have been confirmed, with more than 3.55 million confirmed deaths attributed to COVID-19, making it one of the deadliest pandemics in history . Symptoms of COVID-19 are highly variable, ranging from none to life-threateningly severe. COVID-19 transmits when people breathe in air contaminated by droplets and small airborne particles. The risk of breathing these in is highest when people are in close proximity, but they can be inhaled over longer distances, particularly indoors. Transmission can also occur if splashed or sprayed with contaminated fluids, in the eyes nose or mouth, and rarely via contaminated surfaces. People remain contagious for up to 20 days, and can spread the virus even if they do not develop any symptoms. [5] [6] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Africa  2020 2021 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Albania  The COVID-19 pandemic in Albania is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID-19 ) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS-CoV-2 ). The first case in the Republic of Albania was reported in Tirana on 8 March 2020, when a patient and his adult son who had come from Florence , Italy tested positive. [2] Both men later recovered. On 21 December, health minister Ogerta Manastirliu announced the country has decided to suspend flights to and from the UK until January 6 because of a new COVID-19 mutation that transmits more quickly than other variants. All passengers arriving from the UK by land had to self-isolate for 14 days upon entry. The flight suspension took effect on Tuesday, 22 December.

The first confirmed case in Australia was identified on 25 January 2020, in Victoria , when a man who had returned from Wuhan , Hubei , China, tested positive for the virus. [2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Bosnia_and_Herzegovina The COVID-19 pandemic in Bosnia and Herzegovina is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID-19 ) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS-CoV-2 ). The virus was confirmed to have reached Bosnia and Herzegovina on 5 March 2020, when a patient in Banja Luka, who had travelled to Italy , tested positive. Later on the same day, a second case, who was the son of the first case, was reported. [1] On 21 March, the first death in the country from COVID-19 was announced in a hospital in Bihać . The patient was an elderly woman who had been hospitalized two days before. [2] On 17 March, the Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina declared a state of emergency in the entire country. [3] As of 22 April 2021, Bosnia and Herzegovina had the fourth highest deaths per million population in the world at 2,404 per 1 million. Additionally, access to testing in the country has been less widely available as Bosnia and Herzegovina has the 4th lowest testing rate in Europe as of 30 December. [4] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Canada   The COVID-19 pandemic in Canada is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID-19 ). It is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS-CoV-2 ). The virus was confirmed to have reached Canada on January 27, 2020, after an individual who had returned to Toronto from Wuhan , Hubei , China, tested positive. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Eritrea  The COVID-19 pandemic in Eritrea is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID-19 ) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS-CoV-2 ). The virus was confirmed to have reached Eritrea on 21 March 2020. Eritrea is one of the few opaque countries to have reported the pandemic in contrast to Turkmenistan and North Korea . On 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, which was reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019.

As of December 30, 2020 [update] , Mississippi has administered 17,410 COVID-19 vaccine doses, equivalent to 0.58% of the population. [2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Montenegro The COVID-19 pandemic in Montenegro is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID-19 ) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS-CoV-2 ). The virus was confirmed to have spread to Montenegro when its first case was confirmed on 17 March 2020, [1] [2] making it the last European country to register a case of SARS-CoV-2. [3] On 24 May 2020, 68 days after the first case was recorded in Montenegro, it became the first corona-free country in Europe. [4] [5] Within the first outbreak, indexed cases counted 9% of the total reported, 80% of cases were infected due to contact with primary cases, while the origin of infection of the other 11% of cases was not certain. [6] The Government of Montenegro estimated that the country needs EUR 59.2 million private and international relief to address the health, social and economical impact of COVID-19. [7] Montenegro had no active cases from 24 May until 14 June, when the first imported case was reported. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_New_York_(state)  The first case of COVID-19 in the U.S. state of New York during the pandemic was confirmed on March 1, 2020, [2] and the state quickly became an epicenter of the pandemic, with a record 12,274 new cases reported on April 4 and approximately 29,000 more deaths reported for the month of April than the same month in 2019. [7] By April 10, New York had more confirmed cases than any country outside the US. [8] As of March 2, 2021 [update] , the state has reported 35 million tests, [3] with 1,650,560 cumulative cases, and 47,247 deaths. [9] New York had the highest number of confirmed cases of any state from the start of U.S. outbreak until July 22, when it was first surpassed by California and later by Florida , Texas , [10] [11] and Illinois . Approximately half of the state's cases have been in New York City , [3] where nearly half the state's population lives. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_New_Zealand   The COVID-19 pandemic in New Zealand is part of the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID-19 ) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS-CoV-2 ). The first case of the disease in New Zealand was reported on 28 February 2020. As of 1 June 2021 [update] , the country has had a total of 2,673 cases (2,317 confirmed and 356 probable [a] ). 26 people have died from the virus, with cases recorded in all twenty district health board (DHB) areas. [1] The pandemic peaked in early April 2020, with 89 new cases recorded per day and 929 active cases. A total of 1,852,557 [2] COVID tests have been carried out as of 22 March 2021. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Nigeria  The COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID-19 ) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS-CoV-2 ). The first confirmed case in Nigeria was announced on 27 February 2020, when an Italian citizen in Lagos tested positive for the virus. [3] [4] On 9 March 2020, a second case of the virus was reported in Ewekoro , Ogun State , a Nigerian citizen who had contact with the Italian citizen. [5] On 28 January, the Federal government of Nigeria assured citizens of the country of its readiness to strengthen surveillance at five international airports in the country to prevent the spread of coronavirus. The government announced the airports as Enugu , Lagos , Rivers , Kano and the FCT . [6] The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control also announced same day that they had already set up coronavirus group and was ready to activate its incident system if any case emerged in Nigeria. [7] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Oceania  2020 2021 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Papua_New_Guinea  The COVID-19 pandemic in Papua New Guinea is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID-19 ) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS-CoV-2 ). The virus was confirmed to have reached Papua New Guinea on 20 March 2020. [3] On 4 May 2020, Papua New Guinea was declared COVID-19 free. However, on 20 June, the government confirmed another case of COVID-19, meaning that the disease was present again within the country. [4] [5] Until early 2021, the country managed to stave off a major COVID-19 outbreak, with only 1,275 cases reported at the end of February according to Johns Hopkins University. In March cases tripled, with Prime Minister James Marape speaking of "rampant community transmission". [6] By early May, the number of hospitalizations in the capital Port Moresby stabilized, but delays in receiving test results from regional areas were a concern. [7] In mid May, as the reasons for the apparent easing of the pandemic situation remained uncertain, discrepancies between government figures and higher ones from the provinces led to concerns that hundreds of COVID-19 cases had been missed in the national tally. [8] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_the_United_Kingdom   The COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID-19 ) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS-CoV-2 ). The virus reached the UK in late January 2020. As of 30 May 2021 [update] , there had been  4.5 million cases confirmed and  128,030 deaths overall among people who had recently tested positive – the world's sixteenth-highest death rate by population [5] [6] and the highest death toll in Europe . [7] There have been 153,093 deaths where the death certificate mentioned COVID by 14 May 2021 (see Statistics ). [4] There has been some disparity between the outbreak's severity in England , Scotland , Wales and Northern Ireland – health in the UK is devolved , with each of the four having its own publicly funded healthcare system and government.

A United States Naval Academy graduate, he became a naval aviator , first flying helicopters and then switching to fighters. After completing naval nuclear training, he served as an officer on several aircraft carriers. In spring 2020, he was commanding officer of the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt when the coronavirus disease broke out among the crew . [1] He was relieved of command by then-acting Secretary of the Navy Thomas Modly after sending a letter to Navy leaders asking that most of the crew be taken ashore which was subsequently leaked to the press. [2] [3] [4] Crozier himself was later diagnosed with the virus. Brett Elliott Crozier [5] grew up in Santa Rosa, California . He graduated from Santa Rosa High School in 1988 and then entered the United States Naval Academy . [6] He graduated from the Academy in 1992. He received his master's degree in National Security and Strategic Studies from the Naval War College in 2007, and completed Nuclear Power School in 2014. [7] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_Princess_(ship)   Diamond Princess is a British-registered cruise ship owned and operated by Princess Cruises . She began operation in March 2004 and primarily cruises in Asia during the northern hemisphere summer and Australia during the southern hemisphere summer. She is a subclassed Grand -class ship, which is also known as a Gem -class ship. Diamond Princess and her sister ship , Sapphire Princess , are the widest subclass of Grand -class ships, as they have a 37.5-metre (123 ft 0 in) beam , while all other Grand -class ships have a beam of 36 metres (118 ft 1 in). Diamond Princess and Sapphire Princess were both built in Nagasaki, Japan , by Mitsubishi Industries . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farmers_to_Families_Food_Box https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Fauci   Anthony Stephen Fauci ( / ˈ f aʊ tʃ i / ; born December 24, 1940) is an American physician-scientist and immunologist who serves as the director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and the chief medical advisor to the president . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatten_the_curve  Flattening the curve is a public health strategy to slow down the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus during the COVID-19 pandemic . The curve being flattened is the epidemic curve , a visual representation of the number of infected people needing health care over time. During an epidemic, a health care system can break down when the number of people infected exceeds the capability of the health care system's ability to take care of them. Flattening the curve means slowing the spread of the epidemic so that the peak number of people requiring care at a time is reduced, and the health care system does not exceed its capacity. Flattening the curve relies on mitigation techniques such as hand washing , use of face masks and social distancing . A complementary measure is to increase health care capacity, to "raise the line". [4] As described in an article in The Nation , "preventing a health care system from being overwhelmed requires a society to do two things: 'flatten the curve'—that is, slow the rate of infection so there aren't too many cases that need hospitalization at one time—and 'raise the line'—that is, boost the hospital system's capacity to treat large numbers of patients." [5] As of April 2020 [update] , in the case of the COVID-19 pandemic, two key measures are to increase the numbers of available ICU beds and ventilators , which are in systemic shortage . [2] [ needs update ] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gam-COVID-Vac  2020 2021 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_fight  The Josh fight was a viral Internet meme , mock fight , and charity fundraiser at Air Park in Lincoln, Nebraska , on April 24, 2021. The event was originally conceived by a civil engineering student named Josh Swain from Tucson, Arizona on April 24, 2020. [1] [2] It gained popularity after a screenshot of a Facebook Messenger group chat involving several users named Josh Swain spread widely on the Internet . [3] Swain encouraged participants of the chat to meet at a set of coordinates and compete for the right to use the name " Josh ". The event, though initially intended as a joke, drew a crowd of nearly a thousand on the day of the event. Despite the title, the gathering was lighthearted and there was no actual violence involved. [4] [5] The Wall Street Journal wrote that the event became a "global news phenomenon."

According to the British Medical Journal , the programme aims to deliver 10 million tests per day by 2021. The programme has raised concerns because of its expected cost—£100bn according to a leaked government document, which is about three-quarters of the total annual cost of NHS England . Statisticians have moreover warned that given the inaccuracies inherent in any test, mass testing at this scale is liable to cause hundreds of thousands of false positives a day, resulting in very large numbers of people being told that they are infected when they are not.

[10] It is administered via injection into a vein . [11] [12] During the COVID-19 pandemic , remdesivir was approved or authorized for emergency use to treat COVID‑19 in around 50 countries. [13] Updated guidelines from the World Health Organization in November 2020 include a conditional recommendation against the use of remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19. [14] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socio-economic_impact_of_the_COVID-19_pandemic Socio-economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is covered by: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stay-at-home_order A stay-at-home order , safer-at-home order , movement control order (more common in Southeast Asia), or lockdown restrictions (in the United Kingdom ) – also referred to by loose use of the terms (self-) quarantine , (self-) isolation , or lockdown – is an order from a government authority that restricts movements of a population as a mass quarantine strategy for suppressing or mitigating an epidemic or pandemic by ordering residents to stay home except for essential tasks or for work in essential businesses. The medical distinction between such an order and a quarantine is that a quarantine is usually understood to involve isolating only selected people who are considered to be possibly infectious rather than the entire population of an area (though many colloquially refer to stay-at-home orders as quarantines.) In many cases, outdoor activities are allowed. Non-essential businesses are either closed or adapted to working from home . [1] In some regions, it has been implemented as a round-the-clock curfew [2] or called a shelter-in-place order , [3] but it is not to be confused with a shelter-in-place situation. [4] Similar measures have been used around the world, and, both officially and colloquially, different names have been used to refer to them, often only very loosely linked to the term's actual medical meaning. Examples include confinement , (self-) isolation , ( self-) quarantine , lockdown or ‘strict social distancing measures’. [5] Stay-at-home orders have colloquially (and sometimes officially) been referred to as quarantine or lockdown - but some officials have a concern that the word lockdown may send a wrong message for people to incorrectly think that it includes door-to-door searching for infected people to be forced into quarantines similar to the Hubei lockdown . [6] The term lockdown was used by the media and the World Health Organization (WHO) to describe the action taken in January 2020 by the government of China to restrict movements of people in order to control the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan . [7] [8] When Italian authorities imposed a strict quarantine order in the northern part of the country, the media also used the term lockdown, which was used for Spain and France , as well as other countries around the world. [9] [10] [11] [12] Although it is not a technical term in public health or laws, the media continued to use lockdown to describe the actions taken by these governments. [13] As the lockdowns were expanded to other countries, there was a shift in the definitions. Measures are less restrictive and other terms emerged in attempts to differentiate from the most restrictive measure in China. [5] When the authorities in San Francisco Bay Area in the United States issued an order in March 2020 for residents to stay home to control the outbreak of COVID-19, they called it a shelter-in-place order . [14] People were not familiar with it as the term shelter in place had been used in other emergency situations such as an active shooter which would require seeking a safe place to hide within the same building that the person already occupies until the situation is resolved. [15] This caused confusion to the residents under the order on what exactly they are supposed to do. [16] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Together_at_Home One World: Together at Home (also known as Together at Home ) is a benefit concert that was organized by Global Citizen of New York City and curated by singer Lady Gaga , in support of the World Health Organization . The special was intended to promote the practice of social distancing while staying together during the COVID-19 pandemic . [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] On April 18, 2020, a six-hour pre-show was streamed online immediately prior to the television global broadcast. The online portion of the event was hosted through YouTube by actress and presenter Jameela Jamil (first hour), actor Matthew McConaughey (second hour), actress Danai Gurira (third hour), singer Becky G (fourth hour), actress Laverne Cox (fifth hour) and actor Don Cheadle (sixth hour). It featured appearances from numerous celebrities. The television special, titled One World: Together at Home , was curated in collaboration between Global Citizen and singer-songwriter Lady Gaga , which benefited the World Health Organization 's COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund . [43] Jimmy Fallon , Jimmy Kimmel , and Stephen Colbert hosted the show, which was a syndicated broadcast that aired on April 18, 2020. The special was also simulcast on select U.S. cable television networks, streaming platforms, and international broadcast networks. [1] In the UK, the show was hosted by Clara Amfo , Dermot O'Leary and Claudia Winkleman and was broadcast on BBC One . [44] The special was broadcast on CBS, ABC, NBC and other global networks and platforms.

[1] Also referred to as the President's Coronavirus Task Force , it was established on January 29, 2020, with Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar as chair. [2] On February 26, 2020, U.S. vice president Mike Pence was named to chair the task force, and Deborah Birx was named the response coordinator. [3] The task force was succeeded by the White House COVID-19 Response Team under the Biden administration . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_COVID-19_outbreak   The White House COVID-19 outbreak was a cluster of SARS-CoV-2 infections that began in September 2020 and ended in January 2021 that spread among people, including many U.S. government officials, who were in close contact during the COVID-19 pandemic in Washington, D.C. Numerous high-profile individuals were infected, including President Donald Trump , who was hospitalized for three days. [5] At least 48 White House staff members or associates, closely working with White House personnel, tested positive for the virus. [2] [3] [6] The White House resisted efforts to engage in contact tracing , leaving it unclear how many people were infected in total and what the origins of the spread were. [7] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan_Institute_of_Virology  The Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences ( WIV ; Chinese : 中国科学院武汉病毒研究所 ) is a research institute on virology administered by the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), which reports to the State Council of the People's Republic of China . [2] Located in Jiangxia District , Wuhan , Hubei , it opened mainland China's first biosafety level 4 (BSL–4) laboratory. [3] The institute has strong ties to the Galveston National Laboratory in the United States, the Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie in France, and the National Microbiology Laboratory in Canada. The institute has been an active research center for the study of coronaviruses . The WIV was founded in 1956 as the Wuhan Microbiology Laboratory under the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). In 1961, it became the South China Institute of Microbiology, and in 1962 was renamed Wuhan Microbiology Institute. In 1970, it became the Microbiology Institute of Hubei Province when the Hubei Commission of Science and Technology took over the administration. In June 1978, it was returned to the CAS and renamed Wuhan Institute of Virology. [4] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health  Health is a state of physical, mental and social well-being in which disease and infirmity are absent. [1] The meaning of health has evolved over time. In keeping with the biomedical perspective, early definitions of health focused on the theme of the body's ability to function; health was seen as a state of normal function that could be disrupted from time to time by disease . An example of such a definition of health is: "a state characterized by anatomic, physiologic, and psychological integrity; ability to perform personally valued family, work, and community roles; ability to deal with physical , biological , psychological , and social stress ". [2] Then in 1948, in a radical departure from previous definitions, the World Health Organization (WHO) proposed a definition that aimed higher: linking health to well-being , in terms of "physical, mental, and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease and infirmity". [3] Although this definition was welcomed by some as being innovative, it was also criticized as being vague, excessively broad and was not construed as measurable. For a long time, it was set aside as an impractical ideal and most discussions of health returned to the practicality of the biomedical model. [4] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abenomask https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accident An accident is an unplanned event that sometimes has inconvenient, undesirable or even disastrous consequences, other times being inconsequential. The occurrence of such an event may or may not have unrecognized or unaddressed risks contributing to its cause. Most scientists who study unintentional injury avoid using the term "accident" and focus on factors that increase risk of severe injury and that reduce injury incidence and severity. [1] Physical examples of accidents include unintended motor vehicle collisions or falls, being injured by touching something sharp, hot, dropping a plate, accidentally kicking the leg of a chair while walking, unintentionally biting one's tongue while eating, accidentally tipping over a glass of water, contacting electricity or ingesting poison. Non-physical examples are unintentionally revealing a secret or otherwise saying something incorrectly, accidental deletion of data, forgetting an appointment etc. In the process industry, a primary accident may propagate to nearby units, resulting in a chain of accidents, which is called domino effect accident . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amniocentesis Amniocentesis (also referred to as an amniotic fluid test or, informally, an " amnio ") is a medical procedure [note 1] used primarily in prenatal diagnosis of chromosomal abnormalities and fetal infections [1] as well as for sex determination . In this procedure, a small amount of amniotic fluid , which contains fetal tissues, is sampled from the amniotic sac surrounding a developing fetus . The fetal DNA is then examined for genetic abnormalities. The most common reason to have an amniocentesis performed is to determine whether a fetus has certain genetic disorders or a chromosomal abnormality, such as Down syndrome . Amniocentesis (or another procedure, called chorionic villus sampling (CVS)) can diagnose these problems in the womb. [2] These prenatal examinations can prove helpful to expectant guardians, as they allow for evaluating the fetal health status and the feasibility of treatment. [3] An amniocentesis is performed when a woman is between 15 and 20 weeks gestation. [4] Women who choose to have this test are primarily those at increased risk for genetic and chromosomal problems, in part because the test is invasive and carries a small risk of miscarriage . [4] This process can be used for prenatal sex discernment and hence this procedure has legal restrictions in some countries. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amniotic_sac The amniotic sac , commonly called the bag of waters , [1] [2] sometimes the membranes , [3] is the sac in which the embryo and later fetus develops in amniotes . It is a thin but tough transparent pair of membranes that hold a developing embryo (and later fetus) until shortly before birth . The inner of these membranes, the amnion , encloses the amniotic cavity , containing the amniotic fluid and the embryo. The outer membrane, the chorion , contains the amnion and is part of the placenta . On the outer side, the amniotic sac is connected to the yolk sac , the allantois , and via the umbilical cord , the placenta . [4] The yolk sac, amnion, chorion, and allantois are the four extraembryonic membranes that lie outside of the embryo and are involved in providing nutrients and protection to the developing embryo. [5] They form from the inner cell mass ; the first to form is the yolk sac followed by the amnion which grows over the developing embryo. The amnion remains an important extraembryonic membrane throughout prenatal development. The third membrane is the allantios, and the fourth is the chorion which surrounds the embryo after about a month and eventually fuses with the amnion. [6] Amniocentesis is a medical procedure where fluid from the sac is sampled [7] during fetal development , after 15 weeks of pregnancy, [8] to be used in prenatal diagnosis of chromosomal abnormalities and fetal infections. [9] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant  Antioxidants are compounds that inhibit oxidation , a chemical reaction that can produce free radicals and chain reactions that may damage the cells of organisms. Antioxidants such as thiols or ascorbic acid (vitamin C) may act to inhibit these reactions. To balance oxidative stress , plants and animals maintain complex systems of overlapping antioxidants, such as glutathione . The only dietary antioxidants are vitamins A , C , and E . The term antioxidant is also used for industrial chemicals added during manufacturing to prevent oxidation in synthetic rubber , plastics , and fuels, or as preservatives in food and cosmetics . [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldness  Hair loss , also known as alopecia or baldness , refers to a loss of hair from part of the head or body. [1] Typically at least the head is involved. [3] The severity of hair loss can vary from a small area to the entire body. [6] Inflammation or scarring is not usually present. [3] Hair loss in some people causes psychological distress . [2] Common types include male- or female-pattern hair loss , alopecia areata , and a thinning of hair known as telogen effluvium . [3] The cause of male-pattern hair loss is a combination of genetics and male hormones ; the cause of female pattern hair loss is unclear; the cause of alopecia areata is autoimmune ; and the cause of telogen effluvium is typically a physically or psychologically stressful event. [3] Telogen effluvium is very common following pregnancy . [3] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benign_paroxysmal_vertigo_of_childhood Benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood is an uncommon neurological disorder which presents with recurrent episodes of dizziness . [1] The presentation is usually between the ages of 2 years and 7 years of age and is characterised by short episodes of vertigo of sudden onset when the child appears distressed and unwell. The child may cling to something or someone for support. The episode lasts only minutes and resolves suddenly and completely. It is a self-limiting condition and usually resolves after about eighteen months, although many go on to experience migrainous vertigo (or vestibular migraine) when older. [ citation needed ] Benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood is a migrainous phenomenon with more than 50% of those affected having a family history of migraines affecting a first-degree relative . It has no relationship to benign paroxysmal positional vertigo which is a different condition entirely. [ citation needed ]  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bite Biting is a common behavior involving the opening and closing of the jaw . This behavior is found in reptiles , mammals , fish and amphibians . Arthropods can also bite. Biting can be a physical action in result of an attack, but it is also a normal activity or response in an animal as it eats, carries objects, softens and prepares food for its young, removes ectoparasites from its body surface, removes plant seeds attached to its fur or hair, scratching itself, and grooming other animals. Animal bites often result in serious infections and some times even death. [2] Dog bites are commonplace, with human children the most commonly bitten by dogs and the face being the most commonly bitten target. [3] The muscle fibers in the jaw are responsible for the opening and closing of the mouth. They initially allow the organism to open their jaw, then contract to bring the teeth together, resulting in the action of a bite. [4] This behavior can have many implications and is exhibited by many different types of organisms, typically dangerous species such as spiders, snakes, and sharks. Biting is one of the main functions in an organism's life, providing the ability to forage, eat, build, play, protect and much more. The types of teeth that organisms use to bite varies throughout the animal kingdom . Different types of teeth are seen in herbivores , carnivores , and omnivores as they are adapted over many years to better fit their diets. Carnivores possess canine, carnassial , and molar teeth , while herbivores are equipped with incisor teeth and wide-back molars. [5] In general, tooth shape has traditionally been used to predict dieting habits. [6] Carnivores have long, extremely sharp teeth for both gripping prey and cutting meat into chunks. [7] They lack flat chewing teeth because they swallow food in chunks. An example of this is shown by the broad, serrated teeth of great white sharks which prey on large marine animals. [8] On the other hand, herbivores have rows of wide, flat teeth to bite and chew grass and other plants. Cows spend up to eleven hours a day biting off grass and grinding it with their molars. [9] Omnivores consume both meat and plants, so they possess a mixture of flat teeth and sharp teeth. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_donation A blood donation occurs when a person voluntarily has blood drawn and used for transfusions and/or made into biopharmaceutical medications by a process called fractionation (separation of whole blood components). Donation may be of whole blood, or of specific components directly ( apheresis ). Blood banks often participate in the collection process as well as the procedures that follow it. Today in the developed world , most blood donors are unpaid volunteers who donate blood for a community supply. In some countries, established supplies are limited and donors usually give blood when family or friends need a transfusion (directed donation).  Many donors donate for several reasons, such as a form of charity, general awareness regarding the demand for blood, increased confidence in oneself, helping a personal friend or relative, and social pressure.  Despite the many reasons that people donate, not enough potential donors actively donate.  However, this is reversed during disasters when blood donations increase, often creating an excess supply that will have to be later discarded.  However, in countries that allow paid donation some people are paid, and in some cases there are incentives other than money such as paid time off from work. People can also have blood drawn for their own future use ( autologous donation ). Donating is relatively safe, but some donors have bruising where the needle is inserted or may feel faint. Potential donors are evaluated for anything that might make their blood unsafe to use. The screening includes testing for diseases that can be transmitted by a blood transfusion, including HIV and viral hepatitis . The donor must also answer questions about medical history and take a short physical examination to make sure the donation is not hazardous to his or her health. How often a donor can donate varies from days to months based on what component they donate and the laws of the country where the donation takes place. For example, in the United States, donors must wait 56 days (eight weeks) between whole-blood donations but only seven days between platelet apheresis donations [1] and twice per seven-day period in plasmapheresis . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar  The blood sugar level, blood sugar concentration , or blood glucose level is the measure of concentration of glucose present in the blood of humans or other animals. Approximately 4 grams of glucose, a simple sugar , is present in the blood of a 70 kg (154 lb) human at all times. [2] The body tightly regulates blood glucose levels as a part of metabolic homeostasis . [2] Glucose is stored in skeletal muscle and liver cells in the form of glycogen ; [2] in fasting individuals, blood glucose is maintained at a constant level at the expense of glycogen stores in the liver and skeletal muscle. [2] In humans, a blood glucose level of 4 grams, or about a teaspoon, is critical for normal function in a number of tissues, and the human brain consumes approximately 60% of blood glucose in fasting, sedentary individuals. [2] A persistent elevation in blood glucose leads to glucose toxicity, which contributes to cell dysfunction and the pathology grouped together as complications of diabetes . [2] Glucose can be transported from the intestines or liver to other tissues in the body via the bloodstream. [2] Cellular glucose uptake is primarily regulated by insulin , a hormone produced in the pancreas . [2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_modification Body modification (or body alteration ) is the deliberate altering of the human anatomy or human physical appearance . [1] It is often done for aesthetics, sexual enhancement, rites of passage, religious beliefs , to display group membership or affiliation, in remembrance of lived experience, traditional symbolism such as axis mundi and mythology , to create body art , for shock value , and as self-expression, among other reasons. [1] [2] In its broadest definition it includes skin tattooing, socially acceptable decoration ( e.g. , common ear piercing in many societies), and religious rites of passage (e.g., circumcision in a number of cultures), as well as the modern primitive movement. Nipple cutting: Nullification involves the voluntary removal of body parts. Body parts that are commonly removed by those practicing body nullification are: penis , testicles , clitoris , labia and nipples . Sometimes people who desire a nullification may be diagnosed with gender dysphoria , body integrity identity disorder or apotemnophilia . [11] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumcision  Circumcision is the removal of the foreskin from the human penis . [1] [2] In the most common procedure, the foreskin is opened, adhesions are removed, and the foreskin is separated from the glans . After that, a circumcision device may be placed, and then the foreskin is cut off. Topical or locally injected anesthesia is generally used to reduce pain and physiologic stress . [3] The procedure is most often an elective surgery performed on babies and children for religious or cultural reasons. [4] Medically, circumcision is a treatment option for problematic cases of phimosis and balanoposthitis that do not resolve with other treatments, and for chronic urinary tract infections (UTIs). [5] [6] It is contraindicated in cases of certain genital structure abnormalities or poor general health. [1] [6] The positions of the world's major medical organizations range from a belief that elective circumcision of babies and children carries significant risks and offers no medical benefits to a belief that the procedure has a modest health benefit that outweighs small risks. [7] No major medical organization recommends circumcising all males, and no major medical organization recommends banning the procedure. [7] Ethical and legal questions regarding informed consent and human rights have been raised over the circumcision of babies and children for non-medical reasons; for these reasons, the procedure is controversial . [8] [9] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloth_facemask  A cloth face mask is a mask made of common textiles , usually cotton , worn over the mouth and nose. When more effective masks are not available, and when physical distancing is impossible, cloth face masks are recommended by public health agencies for disease "source control" in epidemic situations to protect others from virus laden droplets in infected mask wearers' breath, coughs, and sneezes. Because they are less effective than N95 masks , surgical masks , or physical distancing in protecting the wearer against viruses, they are not considered to be personal protective equipment by public health agencies. They are used by the general public in household and community settings as protection against both infectious diseases and particulate air pollution . Cloth face masks were routinely used by healthcare workers starting from the late 19th century until the mid 20th century.  In the 1960s they fell out of use in the developed world in favor of modern surgical masks, but their use has persisted in developing countries .  During the COVID-19 pandemic , their use in developed countries was revived due to shortages of surgical masks and respirators, as well as for environmental concerns and practicality. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjoined_twins Conjoined twins or Siamese twins are identical twins [1] joined in utero . A very rare phenomenon, the occurrence is estimated to range from 1 in 49,000 births to 1 in 189,000 births, with a somewhat higher incidence in Southwest Asia and Africa. [2] Approximately half are stillborn , and an additional one-third die within 24 hours. Most live births are female, with a ratio of 3:1. [2] [3] Two contradicting theories exist to explain the origins of conjoined twins. The more generally accepted theory is fission , in which the fertilized egg splits partially. [4] The other theory, no longer believed to be the basis of conjoined twinning, [4] is fusion , in which a fertilized egg completely separates, but stem cells (which search for similar cells) find similar stem cells on the other twin and fuse the twins together. Conjoined twins share a single common chorion , placenta , and amniotic sac , although these characteristics are not exclusive to conjoined twins, as there are some monozygotic but non-conjoined twins who also share these structures in utero . [5] Chang and Eng Bunker (1811–1874) were brothers born in Siam who traveled widely for many years and were labeled as The Siamese Twins . Chang and Eng were joined at the torso by a band of flesh, cartilage, and their fused livers. In modern times, they could have been easily separated. [6] Due to the brothers' fame and the rarity of the condition, the term "Siamese twins" came to be used as a synonym for conjoined twins. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coprolalia Coprolalia ( / ˌ k ɒ p r ə ˈ l eɪ l i ə / ) is involuntary swearing or the involuntary utterance of obscene words or socially inappropriate and derogatory remarks. Coprolalia comes from the Greek κόπρος ( kópros ), meaning "dung, feces ", and λαλιά ( laliā́ ) "speech", from λαλεῖν ( laleîn ) "to talk". [1] Coprolalia is an occasional characteristic of tic disorders , in particular Tourette syndrome , although it is not required for a diagnosis of Tourette's and only about 10% of Tourette's patients exhibit coprolalia. [2] It is not unique to tic disorders; it is also a rare symptom of other neurological disorders. Coprolalia is one type of coprophenomenon. Other coprophenomena include the related symptoms of copropraxia , involuntary actions such as performing obscene or forbidden gestures, [3] and coprographia , making obscene writings or drawings. [4] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coprophagia Coprophagia ( / ˌ k ɒ p r ə ˈ f eɪ dʒ i ə / ) [1] or coprophagy ( / k ə ˈ p r ɒ f ə dʒ i / ) is the consumption of feces . The word is derived from the Greek κόπρος copros , "feces" and φαγεῖν phagein , "to eat". Coprophagy refers to many kinds of feces-eating, including eating feces of other species (heterospecifics), of other individuals (allocoprophagy), or one's own (autocoprophagy) – those once deposited or taken directly from the anus . [2] In humans, coprophagia has been described since the late 19th century in individuals with mental illnesses and in unconventional sexual acts. [3] Some animal species eat feces as a normal behavior, in particular lagomorphs , which do so to allow tough plant materials to be digested more thoroughly by passing twice through the digestive tract. Other species may eat feces under certain conditions . Centuries ago [ when? ] , physicians tasted their patients' feces, to better judge their state and condition. [4] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_vaccine  2020 2021 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detoxification Detoxification or detoxication ( detox for short) [1] is the physiological or medicinal removal of toxic substances from a living organism , including the human body, which is mainly carried out by the liver. Additionally, it can refer to the period of drug withdrawal during which an organism returns to homeostasis after long-term use of an addictive substance. [2] [3] In medicine , detoxification can be achieved by decontamination of poison ingestion and the use of antidotes as well as techniques such as dialysis and (in a limited number of cases) chelation therapy . [4] Many alternative medicine practitioners promote various types of detoxification such as detoxification diets . Scientists have described these as a "waste of time and money". [5] [6] Sense About Science , a UK-based charitable trust, determined that most such dietary "detox" claims lack any supporting evidence. [7] [8] The liver and kidney are naturally capable of detox, as are intracellular (specifically, inner membrane of mitochondria or in the endoplasmic reticulum of cells) proteins such as CYP enyzmes . In cases of kidney failure , the action of the kidneys is mimicked by dialysis ; kidney and liver transplants are also used for kidney and liver failure, respectively. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distress_(medicine) In medicine, distress is an aversive state in which a person is unable to completely adapt to stressors and their resulting stress and shows maladaptive behaviors. [1] It can be evident in the presence of various phenomena, such as inappropriate social interaction (e.g., aggression, passivity, or withdrawal). Distress is the opposite of eustress , a positive stress that motivates people. Stress can be created by influences such as work , school, peers or co-workers, family and death. Other influences vary by age. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Dix  Adrian Dix (born April 20, 1964) [1] is a Canadian politician serving as the current Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) for Vancouver-Kingsway in British Columbia . In addition to serving as the current Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) for Vancouver-Kingsway in British Columbia, Dix is also serving as the current Minister Responsible for Francophone Affairs in British Columbia [2] and the current Minister of Health in British Columbia. He has also served as the leader of the British Columbia New Democratic Party (BC NDP) from 2011 to 2014. [3] He was first elected to the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia in the 2005 provincial election . Dix's decision in 2013 to be replaced as leader came following the party's disappointing result in the May 2013 provincial election which the BC NDP lost despite a 20-point lead in the polls prior to the election campaign. [4] Adrian Dix was born in Vancouver, to parents Ken and Hilda, immigrants from Ireland and Britain, respectively. His parents ran the Dix Insurance Agency Ltd. on West 41st Avenue in Vancouver until 2011 when his father retired and sold the business. [5] Growing up in Vancouver, Dix was raised as an Anglican and attended both St. George's School and Point Grey Secondary . He then went on to study history and political science at the University of British Columbia . Dix has two siblings and currently lives in Vancouver with his wife Renée Saklikar , a poet and writer. [6] Dix was diagnosed with Type-1 diabetes in his 20s. [5] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyslipidemia Dyslipidemia is an abnormal amount of lipids (e.g. triglycerides, cholesterol and/or fat phospholipids) in the blood. [1] Dyslipidemia is a risk factor for the development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease ( ASCVD ). [1] ASCVD includes coronary artery disease, cerbrovascular disease, and peripheral artery disease. [1] Although dyslipidemia is a risk factor for ASCVD, abnormal levels doesn't mean that lipid lowering agents need to be started. [2] Other factors, such as comorbid conditions and lifestyle in addition to dyslipidemia, is considered in a cardiovascular risk assessment. [3] In developed countries, most dyslipidemias are hyperlipidemias ; that is, an elevation of lipids in the blood.  This is often due to diet and lifestyle. Prolonged elevation of insulin resistance can also lead to dyslipidemia. [1] Likewise, increased levels of O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) may cause dyslipidemia. [ citation needed ] Physicians and basic researchers classify dyslipidemias in two distinct ways. One way is its presentation in the body (including the specific type of lipid that is increased). [1] The other way is due to the underlying cause for the condition ( genetic , or secondary to another condition). [1] This classification can be problematic, because most conditions involve the intersection of genetics and lifestyle issues. [1] However, there are a few well-defined genetic conditions that are usually easy to identify. [1] The three main blood levels collected to assess for dyslipidemia is triglycerides (TG), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). [4] High triglyceride levels (>1.7 mmol/L fasting) can indicate dyslipidemia. [2] Triglycerides are transported through the blood by using very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) as a carrier. [1] One thing to note when measuring triglyceride levels is that fasting for 8-12 hours is required to get an accurate result as non-fasting TG results may be falsely elevated. [4] If TG results are greater than 10 mmol/L, then this needs to be addressed since severe hypertriglceridemia is a risk factor for acute pancreatitis . [2] Another blood level collected to assess dyslipidemia is HDL-C. [4] HDL cholesterol is made up of very little lipids and a high amount of protein. [1] It is beneficial in the body because it functions by going to the tissues and picking up extra cholestrol and fat . [1] Due to the positive effects of HDL-C, it is named "good cholesterol" since it helps prevent plaque formation. [1] Other functions of HDL-C is promoting cardiovascular health such as antioxidation effects, protection against thrombosis , maintenance of endothelial function, and maintaining low blood viscosity. [1] Due to the positive functions of HDL cholesterol, a low level indicates dyslipidemia and is a risk factor for complications. [1] Another diagnostic test that is often reviewed is LDL cholesterol. [4] Low density lipoproteins are made up of cholesterol, TG, phospholipids, and apolipoproteins . [5] LDL-C molecules bind to the endothelium of blood vessels and cause plaque formation. [5] Once plaques are formed, LDL-C floating in the bloodstream can attach to the plaques and cause further accumulation. [5] In addition to plaque formation, LDL-C molecules can undergo oxidation. [1] Oxidation can cause further accumulation of cholesterol and the release of inflammatory cytokines , which damages the blood vessels. [1] [5] Due to the damaging effects of LDL-C, high levels increase the risk for cardiovascular disease and indicate dyslipidemia. [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroconvulsive_therapy Electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT ) is a psychiatric treatment where a generalized seizure (without muscular convulsions ) is electrically induced to manage refractory mental disorders . [1] Typically, 70 to 120 volts are applied externally to the patient's head resulting in approximately 800 milliamperes of direct current passed through the brain, for 100 milliseconds to 6 seconds duration, either from temple to temple (bilateral ECT) or from front to back of one side of the head (unilateral ECT). The ECT procedure was first conducted in 1938 by Italian psychiatrist Ugo Cerletti [2] and rapidly replaced less safe and effective forms of biological treatments in use at the time. ECT is often used with informed consent [3] as a safe and effective intervention for major depressive disorder , mania , and catatonia . [4] ECT machines were originally placed in the Class III category by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1976. [5] They were re-classified as Class II devices, for treatment of catatonia, major depressive disorder, and bipolar disorder , in 2018. [6] Aside from effects on the brain, the general physical risks of ECT are similar to those of brief general anesthesia . [7] : 259 Immediately following treatment, the most common adverse effects are confusion and transient memory loss. [4] [8] Among treatments for severely depressed pregnant women, ECT is one of the least harmful to the fetus . [9] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabethan_collar An Elizabethan collar , E-collar , Buster collar or pet cone (sometimes humorously called a pet lamp-shade , pet radar dish , dog-saver , or cone of shame ) is a protective medical device worn by an animal, usually a cat or dog. Shaped like a truncated cone, its purpose is to prevent the animal from biting or licking at its body or scratching at its head or neck while wounds or injuries heal . [1] The collars are named from the ruffs worn in Elizabethan times .  A U.S. patent was filed by Frank L. Johnson in 1959. [2] The device is generally attached to the pet's usual collar with strings or tabs passed through holes punched in the sides of the plastic. The neck of the collar should be short enough to let the animal eat and drink. Although most pets adjust to them quite well, others will not eat or drink with the collar in place and the collar is temporarily removed for meals. [3] While purpose-made collars can be purchased from veterinarians or pet stores, they can also be made from plastic and cardboard or by using plastic flowerpots, wastebaskets, buckets or lampshades. Modern collars might involve soft fabric trim along the edges to increase comfort and velcro surfaces for ease of attachment and removal. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equilibrioception The sense of balance or equilibrioception is the perception of balance and spatial orientation . [1] It helps prevent humans and nonhuman animals from falling over when standing or moving. Equilibrioception is the result of a number of sensory systems working together: the eyes ( visual system ), the inner ears ( vestibular system ), and the body's sense of where it is in space ( proprioception ) ideally need to be intact. [1] The vestibular system, the region of the inner ear where three semicircular canals converge, works with the visual system to keep objects in focus when the head is moving. This is called the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) . The balance system works with the visual and skeletal systems (the muscles and joints and their sensors) to maintain orientation or balance. Visual signals sent to the brain about the body's position in relation to its surroundings are processed by the brain and compared to information from the vestibular and skeletal systems. In the vestibular system, equilibrioception is determined by the level of a fluid called endolymph in the labyrinth , a complex set of tubing in the inner ear . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eustress Eustress means beneficial stress —either psychological, physical (e.g. exercise), or biochemical/radiological ( hormesis ). The term was coined by endocrinologist Hans Selye , consisting of the Greek prefix eu- meaning "good", and stress , literally meaning "good stress". It is the positive cognitive response to stress that is healthy, or gives one a feeling of fulfillment or other positive feelings. Selye created the term as a subgroup of stress to differentiate the wide variety of stressors and manifestations of stress. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue Fatigue is a feeling of tiredness. [1] It may be sudden or gradual in onset. It is a normal phenomenon if it follows prolonged physical or mental activity, and resolves completely with rest. However, it may be a symptom of a medical condition if it is prolonged, severe, progressive, or occurs without provocation. Physical fatigue is the transient inability of muscles to maintain optimal physical performance, and is made more severe by intense physical exercise . [2] [3] [4] Mental fatigue is a transient decrease in maximal cognitive performance resulting from prolonged periods of cognitive activity. Mental fatigue can manifest as somnolence , lethargy , or directed attention fatigue . [5] Fatigue and 'feelings of fatigue' are sometimes confused. [6] Unlike weakness , fatigue can usually be alleviated by periods of rest . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female_genital_mutilation   Female genital mutilation ( FGM ), also known as female genital cutting and female circumcision , [a] is the ritual cutting or removal of some or all of the external female genitalia . The practice is found in Africa, Asia and the Middle East, and within communities from countries in which FGM is common. UNICEF estimated in 2016 that 200 million women living today in 30 countries—27 African countries, Indonesia, Iraqi Kurdistan and Yemen—have undergone the procedures. [3] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_aid First aid is the first and immediate assistance given to any person suffering from either a minor or serious illness or injury , [1] with care provided to preserve life, prevent the condition from worsening, or to promote recovery. It includes initial intervention in a serious condition prior to professional medical help being available, such as performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) while waiting for an ambulance , as well as the complete treatment of minor conditions, such as applying a plaster to a cut . First aid is generally performed by someone with basic medical training. Mental health first aid is an extension of the concept of first aid to cover mental health, [2] while psychological first aid is used as early treatment of people who are at risk for developing PTSD. [3] Conflict First Aid, focused on preservation and recovery of an individual's social or relationship well-being, is being piloted in Canada. There are many situations that may require first aid, and many countries have legislation, regulation, or guidance which specifies a minimum level of first aid provision in certain circumstances. This can include specific training or equipment to be available in the workplace (such as an automated external defibrillator ), the provision of specialist first aid cover at public gatherings, or mandatory first aid training within schools. First aid, however, does not necessarily require any particular equipment or prior knowledge, and can involve improvisation with materials available at the time, often by untrained people. [4] First aid can be performed on nearly all animals, such as pets , [5] although this article relates to the care of human patients. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_aid_kit A first aid kit is a collection of supplies and equipment that is used to give medical treatment. There is a wide variation in the contents of first aid kits based on the knowledge and experience of those putting it together, the differing first aid requirements of the area where it may be used and variations in legislation or regulation in a given area. The international standard for first aid kits is that they should be identified with the ISO graphical symbol for first aid (from ISO 7010 ) which is an equal white cross on a green background. [1] First aid kits can be assembled in almost any type of container, and this will depend on whether they are commercially produced or assembled by an individual.  Standard kits often come in durable plastic boxes, fabric pouches or in wall mounted cabinets.  The type of container will vary depending on the purpose, and they range in size from wallet-sized through to a large box. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateway_drug_theory The gateway drug effect (alternatively, stepping-stone theory , escalation hypothesis , or progression hypothesis ) is a comprehensive catchphrase for the often observed effect that the use of a psychoactive substance is coupled to an increased probability of the use of further substances. Possible causes are biological alterations in the brain due to the earlier substance exposure and similar attitudes of people who use different substances across different substances ( common liability to addiction ). [1] In 2020, the National Institute on Drug Abuse released a study backing allegations that marijuana is a "gateway" to more dangerous substance use, though not for the majority of people who use substances. [2] [3] The concept of gateway drug is based on observations that the sequence of first-time use of different drugs is not random but shows trends . On the basis of established techniques of longitudinal studies such trends can be described precisely in terms of statistical probability . As to the interpretation of the observed trends, it is important to note the difference between sequence and causation. Both may – but need not – be coupled, a question which is subject of further research, e.g., by physiological experiments. [4] From a sample of 6,624 people who had not used other illegal drugs before their cannabis consumption the overall probability of later use of other illegal drugs was estimated to be 44.7%. Subgroup analyses showed that personal and social conditions, such as gender, age, marital status, mental disorders, family history of substance use, overlapping illegal drug distribution channels, alcohol use disorder, nicotine dependence, ethnicity , urbanicity , and educational attainment influenced the height of probability. [5] [6] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination A hallucination is a perception in the absence of external stimulus that has qualities of real perceptions. Hallucinations are vivid, substantial, and are perceived to be located in external objective space. They are distinguishable from several related phenomena , such as dreaming , which does not involve wakefulness; pseudohallucination , which does not mimic real perception, and is accurately perceived as unreal; illusion , which involves distorted or misinterpreted real perception; and imagery (imagination), which does not mimic real perception, and is under voluntary control. [1] Hallucinations also differ from " delusional perceptions", in which a correctly sensed and interpreted stimulus (i.e., a real perception) is given some additional (and typically absurd) significance. Hallucinations can occur in any sensory modality— visual , auditory , olfactory , gustatory , tactile , proprioceptive , equilibrioceptive , nociceptive , thermoceptive and chronoceptive . A mild form of hallucination is known as a disturbance , and can occur in most of the senses above. These may be things like seeing movement in peripheral vision , or hearing faint noises or voices. Auditory hallucinations are very common in schizophrenia . They may be benevolent (telling the subject good things about themselves) or malicious, cursing the subject, etc. 55% of auditory hallucinations are malicious in content, [2] for example, people talking about the subject behind their back, etc. Like auditory hallucinations, the source of the visual counterpart can also be behind the subject's back. This can produce a feeling of being looked or stared at, usually with malicious intent. [ citation needed ] Frequently, auditory hallucinations and their visual counterpart are experienced by the subject together. [3] [ citation needed ] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_-MIT_Program_in_Health_Sciences_and_Technology https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing Healing is the process of the restoration of health from an unbalanced, diseased, damaged or unvitalized organism. The profession of nursing has been traditionally concerned with matters of healing, whereas historically the profession of medicine has been concerned with curing. [1] With physical damage or disease suffered by an organism, healing involves the repair of living tissue(s) , organs and the biological system as a whole and resumption of (normal) functioning. Medicine includes the process by which the cell(s) in the body regenerate and repair to reduce the size of a damaged or necrotic area and replace it with new living tissue. The replacement can happen in two ways: by regeneration in which the necrotic cells are replaced by new cells that form "like" tissue as was originally there; or by repair in which injured tissue is replaced with scar tissue . Most organs will heal using a mixture of both mechanisms. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiccups  A hiccup (also spelled hiccough ) is an involuntary contraction ( myoclonic jerk) of the diaphragm that may repeat several times per minute. The hiccup is an involuntary action involving a reflex arc . [1] Once triggered, the reflex causes a strong contraction of the diaphragm followed about a quarter of a second later by closure of the vocal cords, which results in the "hic" sound. Hiccups may occur individually, or they may occur in bouts. The rhythm of the hiccup, or the time between hiccups, tends to be relatively constant. A bout of hiccups generally resolves itself without intervention, although many home remedies are often used to attempt to shorten the duration. [2] Medical treatment is occasionally necessary in cases of chronic hiccups. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_microbiome  The human microbiome is the aggregate of all microbiota that reside on or within human tissues and biofluids along with the corresponding anatomical sites in which they reside, [1] including the skin, mammary glands, seminal fluid, uterus, ovarian follicles, lung, saliva, oral mucosa , conjunctiva , biliary tract , and gastrointestinal tract . Types of human microbiota include bacteria , archaea , fungi , protists and viruses . Though micro-animals can also live on the human body, they are typically excluded from this definition. In the context of genomics , the term human microbiome is sometimes used to refer to the collective genomes of resident microorganisms; [2] however, the term human metagenome has the same meaning. [1] Humans are colonized by many microorganisms, with approximately the same order of magnitude of non-human cells as human cells. [3] Some microorganisms that colonize humans are commensal , meaning they co-exist without harming humans; others have a mutualistic relationship with their human hosts. [2] : 700 [4] Conversely, some non- pathogenic microorganisms can harm human hosts via the metabolites they produce, like trimethylamine , which the human body converts to trimethylamine N-oxide via FMO3 -mediated oxidation. [5] [6] Certain microorganisms perform tasks that are known to be useful to the human host but the role of most of them is not well understood. Those that are expected to be present, and that under normal circumstances do not cause disease, are sometimes deemed normal flora or normal microbiota . [2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertrophy Hypertrophy ( / h aɪ ˈ p ɜːr t r ə f i / , from Greek ὑπέρ "excess" + τροφή "nourishment") is the increase in the volume of an organ or tissue due to the enlargement of its component cells . [1] It is distinguished from hyperplasia , in which the cells remain approximately the same size but increase in number. [2] Although hypertrophy and hyperplasia are two distinct processes, they frequently occur together, such as in the case of the hormonally -induced proliferation and enlargement of the cells of the uterus during pregnancy . Eccentric hypertrophy is a type of hypertrophy where the walls and chamber of a hollow organ undergo growth in which the overall size and volume are enlarged. It is applied especially to the left ventricle of heart. [3] Sarcomeres are added in series, as for example in dilated cardiomyopathy (in contrast to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy , a type of concentric hypertrophy , where sarcomeres are added in parallel). Forensic post-mortem examination of a case of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy , showing thickening of the cardiac muscle https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_health International health , also called geographic medicine , international medicine , or global health , is a field of health care, usually with a public health emphasis, dealing with health across regional or national boundaries. One subset of international medicine, travel medicine , prepares travelers with immunizations, prophylactic medications, preventive techniques such as bednets and residual pesticides, in-transit care, and post-travel care for exotic illnesses. International health, however, more often refers to health personnel or organizations from one area or nation providing direct health care, or health sector development, in another area or nation. It is this sense of the term that is explained here. More recently, public health experts have become interested in global processes that impact on human health. Globalization and health , for example, illustrates the complex and changing sociological environment within which the determinants of health and disease express themselves. The World Health Organization (WHO) is the international body primarily responsible for regulating and governing health-related policies and practices across nations. While the WHO uses various policies and treaties to address international health issues, many of their policies have no binding power and thus state compliance is often limited. As a result, a Framework Convention on Global Health (FCGH) has recently been proposed as a global health treaty that would use stronger domestic accountability mechanisms (including incentives & sanctions) in order to close national and global health inequities. [1] However, some scholars have addressed concerns regarding the FCGH, arguing that it would duplicate other global health governance efforts, lack feasibility, and have limited impact in regulating global health. [2] Timothy D. Baker was the founder of the first academic department of international health in the United States at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in 1959. [3] [4] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intoxication Intoxication — or poisoning, especially by an alcoholic or narcotic substance — may refer to: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massage  Massage is the manipulation of the body's soft tissues. Massage techniques are commonly applied with hands, fingers, elbows, knees, forearms, feet, or a device. The purpose of massage is generally for the treatment of body stress or pain. A person professionally trained to give massages is traditionally known as a masseur (male) or a masseuse (female) in European countries.  In the United States, these individuals are often referred to as massage therapists because they must be certified and licensed as "Licensed Massage Therapists." In professional settings, clients are treated while lying on a massage table , sitting in a massage chair , or lying on a mat on the floor. There are many different modalities in the massage industry including but not limited to: Swedish, deep tissue, structural integration, trigger point, manual lymphatic drainage, sports massage, Thai massage, and medical-massage. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_diet  The Mediterranean diet is a diet inspired by the eating habits of Greece, Italy, and Spain in the 1960s. [1] [2] The principal aspects of this diet include proportionally high consumption of olive oil , legumes , unrefined cereals , fruits , [3] and vegetables , moderate to high consumption of fish , moderate consumption of dairy products (mostly as cheese and yogurt ), moderate wine consumption, and low consumption of non-fish meat products. Olive oil has been studied as a potential health factor for reducing all-cause mortality and the risk of chronic diseases . The Mediterranean diet is associated with a reduction in all-cause mortality in observational studies . [4] There is some evidence that the Mediterranean diet lowers the risk of heart disease and early death, although a 2019 review determined that the evidence had low quality and was uncertain. [5] [6] The American Heart Association and American Diabetes Association recommend the Mediterranean diet as a healthy dietary pattern that may reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes , respectively. [7] [8] [9] The Mediterranean diet may help with weight loss in obese people . [10] The Mediterranean diet is one of three healthy diets recommended in the 2015-2020 US Dietary Guidelines, which also include the DASH diet or a vegetarian diet . [11] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_capacity Intelligence has been defined in many ways: the capacity for logic , understanding , self-awareness , learning , emotional knowledge , reasoning , planning , creativity , critical thinking , and problem-solving . More generally, it can be described as the ability to perceive or infer information , and to retain it as knowledge to be applied towards adaptive behaviors within an environment or context. Intelligence is most often studied in humans but has also been observed in both non-human animals and in plants despite controversy as to whether some of these forms of life exhibit intelligence. [1] [2] Intelligence in computers or other machines is called artificial intelligence . The word intelligence derives from the Latin nouns intelligentia or intellēctus , which in turn stem from the verb intelligere , to comprehend or perceive. In the Middle Ages , the word intellectus became the scholarly technical term for understanding, and a translation for the Greek philosophical term nous . This term, however, was strongly linked to the metaphysical and cosmological theories of teleological scholasticism , including theories of the immortality of the soul, and the concept of the active intellect (also known as the active intelligence). This approach to the study of nature was strongly rejected by the early modern philosophers such as Francis Bacon , Thomas Hobbes , John Locke , and David Hume , all of whom preferred "understanding" (in place of " intellectus " or "intelligence") in their English philosophical works. [3] [4] Hobbes for example, in his Latin De Corpore , used " intellectus intelligit ", translated in the English version as "the understanding understandeth", as a typical example of a logical absurdity . [5] "Intelligence" has therefore become less common in English language philosophy, but it has later been taken up (with the scholastic theories which it now implies) in more contemporary psychology . [6] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muteness Muteness or mutism (from Latin mutus 'silent') is defined as an absence of speech while conserving or maintaining the ability to hear the speech of others. [1] Mutism is typically understood as an inability to speak on the part of a child or an adult due to an observed lack of speech from the point of view of others who know them. Such observers commonly include a mute person's family members, caregivers, teachers, and health professionals like doctors or speech and language pathologists .  Muteness may not be a permanent condition, depending upon etiology (cause).  In general, someone who is mute may be mute for one of several different reasons: organic, psychological , developmental / neurological trauma . [2] For children, a lack of speech may be developmental, neurological, psychological, or due to a physical disability or a communication disorder . For adults who previously had speech and then became unable to speak, loss of speech may be due to injury, disease, termed aphasia , or surgery affecting areas of the brain needed for speech. Loss of speech in adults may occur rarely for psychological reasons. Treatment or management of muteness depends on what has caused the absence of speech. When there is an absence of speech, a speech assessment is strongly recommended to determine cause and treatment. [3] Treatment of absence of speech is possible in a variety of cases. If the absence of speech is determined to be a permanent condition, a range of assistive and augmentative communication devices are available to aid communication. Organic causes of mutism may stem from several different sources. One cause of muteness may be problems with the physiology involved in speech, for example, the mouth or tongue. [4] Mutism may be due to apraxia , that is, problems with coordination of muscles involved in speech. [5] Another cause may be a medical condition impacting the physical structures involved in speech, for example, loss of voice due to the injury, paralysis, or illness of the larynx . [6] Anarthria is a severe form of dysarthria . The coordination of movements of the mouth and tongue or the conscious coordination of the lungs are damaged. [7] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutilation Mutilation or maiming (from the Latin: mutilus ) is cutting off or causing injury to a body part of a person so that the part of the body is permanently damaged, detached or disfigured. [1] In 2019, Dr. Michael H. Stone , Dr. Gary Brucato and Dr. Ann Burgess proposed formal criteria by which “mutilation” might be systematically distinguished from the act of “ dismemberment ,” as these terms are commonly used interchangeably. They suggested that dismemberment involves “the entire removal, by any means, of a large section of the body of a living or dead person, specifically, the head (also termed decapitation), arms, hands, torso, pelvic area, legs, or feet.” Mutilation, by contrast, involves “the removal or irreparable disfigurement, by any means, of some smaller portion of one of those larger sections of a living or dead person. The latter would include castration (removal of the testicles ), evisceration (removal of the internal organs ), and flaying (removal of the skin ).” According to these parameters, removing a whole hand would constitute dismemberment, while removing or damaging a finger would be mutilation; decapitation of a full head would be dismemberment, while removing or damaging a part of the face would be mutilation; and removing a whole torso would be dismemberment, while removing or damaging a breast or the organs contained within the torso would be mutilation. [2] Some ethnic groups practice ritual mutilation, e.g. scarification , burning , flagellation , tattooing , or wheeling , as part of a rite of passage . In some cases, the term may apply to treatment of dead bodies, such as soldiers mutilated after they have been killed by an enemy. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebulizer In medicine , a nebulizer ( American English ) [1] or nebuliser ( British English ) [2] is a drug delivery device used to administer medication in the form of a mist inhaled into the lungs. Nebulizers are commonly used for the treatment of asthma , cystic fibrosis , COPD and other respiratory diseases or disorders. They use oxygen , compressed air or ultrasonic power to break up solutions and suspensions into small aerosol droplets that are inhaled from the mouthpiece of the device. An aerosol is a mixture of gas and solid or liquid particles. Various asthma guidelines, such as the Global Initiative for Asthma Guidelines [GINA], the British Guidelines on the management of Asthma, The Canadian Pediatric Asthma Consensus Guidelines, and United States Guidelines for Diagnosis and Treatment of Asthma each recommend metered dose inhalers in place of nebulizer-delivered therapies. [3] The European Respiratory Society acknowledge that although nebulizers are used in hospitals and at home they suggest much of this use may not be evidence-based. [4] Recent evidence shows that nebulizers are no more effective than metered-dose inhalers (MDIs) with spacers. [5] An MDI with a spacer may offer advantages to children who have acute asthma. [3] [6] [5] Those findings refer specifically to the treatment of asthma and not to the efficacy of nebulisers generally, as for COPD for example. [5] For COPD, especially when assessing exacerbations or lung attacks, there is no evidence to indicate that MDI (with a spacer) delivered medicine is more effective than administration of the same medicine with a nebulizer. [7] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocturnal_enuresis Nocturnal enuresis , also called bedwetting , is involuntary urination while asleep after the age at which bladder control usually begins. Bedwetting in children and adults can result in emotional stress. [1] Complications can include urinary tract infections . [1] Most bedwetting is a developmental delay —not an emotional problem or physical illness. Only a small percentage (5 to 10%) of bedwetting cases have a specific medical cause. [2] Bedwetting is commonly associated with a family history of the condition. [3] Nocturnal enuresis is considered primary when a child has not yet had a prolonged period of being dry. Secondary nocturnal enuresis is when a child or adult begins wetting again after having stayed dry. Treatments range from behavioral therapy , such as bedwetting alarms , to medication, such as hormone replacement , and even surgery such as urethral dilatation . Since most bedwetting is simply a developmental delay, most treatment plans aim to protect or improve self-esteem . [2] Treatment guidelines recommend that the physician counsel the parents, [4] warning about psychological consequences caused by pressure, shaming, or punishment for a condition children cannot control. [2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_Safety_and_Health Occupational safety and health ( OSH ), also commonly referred to as occupational health and safety ( OHS ), occupational health , [1] or occupational safety , is a multidisciplinary field concerned with the safety , health , and welfare of people at occupation . These terms also refer to the goals of this field, [2] so their use in the sense of this article was originally an abbreviation of occupational safety and health program/department etc. The goal of an occupational safety and health program is to foster a safe and healthy occupational environment. [3] OSH also protects all the general public who may be affected by the occupational environment. [4] In common-law jurisdictions, employers have a common law duty, (also called duty of care) to take reasonable care of the safety of their employees. [5] Statute law may, in addition, impose other general duties, introduce specific duties, and create government bodies with powers to regulate occupational safety issues: details of this vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega-3_fatty_acid Omega−3 fatty acids , also called Omega-3 oils , ω−3 fatty acids or n −3 fatty acids , [1] are polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) characterized by the presence of a double bond, three atoms away from the terminal methyl group in their chemical structure.  They are widely distributed in nature, being important constituents of animal lipid metabolism , and they play an important role in the human diet and in human physiology. [2] [3] The three types of omega−3 fatty acids involved in human physiology are α-linolenic acid (ALA) , found in plant oils, and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), both commonly found in marine oils. [2] Marine algae and phytoplankton are primary sources of omega−3 fatty acids (which also accumulate in fish). Common sources of plant oils containing ALA include walnut , edible seeds, clary sage seed oil, algal oil , flaxseed oil , Sacha Inchi oil, Echium oil, and hemp oil , while sources of animal omega−3 fatty acids EPA and DHA include fish, fish oils , eggs from chickens, squid oils and krill oil . Mammals are unable to synthesize the essential omega−3 fatty acid ALA and can only obtain it through diet. However, they can use ALA, when available, to form EPA and DHA, by creating additional double bonds along its carbon chain ( desaturation ) and extending it ( elongation ). Namely, ALA (18 carbons and 3 double bonds) is used to make EPA (20 carbons and 5 double bonds), which is then used to make DHA (22 carbons and 6 double bonds). [4] The ability to make the longer-chain omega−3 fatty acids from ALA may be impaired in aging. [5] In foods exposed to air, unsaturated fatty acids are vulnerable to oxidation and rancidity . [6] Dietary supplementation with omega−3 fatty acids does not appear to affect the risk of death, cancer or heart disease . [7] Furthermore, fish oil supplement studies have failed to support claims of preventing heart attacks or strokes or any vascular disease outcomes. [8] [9] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega-6_fatty_acid Omega-6 fatty acids (also referred to as ω-6 fatty acids or n -6 fatty acids ) are a family of polyunsaturated fatty acids that have in common a final carbon-carbon double bond in the n -6 position, that is, the sixth bond, counting from the methyl end. [1] Linoleic acid (18:2, n −6), the shortest-chain of the common omega-6 fatty acids in the human diet, is categorized as an essential fatty acid because the human body cannot synthesize it. Omega-6 fatty acids are precursors to endocannabinoids , lipoxins , and specific eicosanoids . Mammalian cells lack the enzyme omega-3 desaturase and therefore cannot convert omega-6 fatty acids to omega-3 fatty acids, which is why certain omega-3 fatty acids are also essential. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteopathy  Osteopathy is a type of alternative medicine that emphasizes physical manipulation of the body's muscle tissue and bones . [1] [2] Practitioners of osteopathy are referred to as osteopaths. [3] [4] [5] Its name derives from Ancient Greek "bone" ( ὀστέον ) and "sensitive to" or "responding to" ( -πάθεια ). [6] [7] [8] Osteopathic manipulation is the core set of techniques in osteopathy. [9] Parts of osteopathy, such as craniosacral therapy , have no therapeutic value and have been labeled as pseudoscience and quackery . [10] [11] The techniques are based on an ideology created by Andrew Taylor Still (1828–1917) which posits the existence of a " myofascial continuity"—a tissue layer that "links every part of the body with every other part". Osteopaths attempt to diagnose and treat what was originally called "the osteopathic lesion", but which is now named "somatic dysfunction", [9] by manipulating a person's bones and muscles. Osteopathic Manipulative Treatment (OMT) techniques are most commonly used to treat back pain and other musculoskeletal issues. [9] [12] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poison In biology , poisons are substances that can cause death , injury or harm to organs , tissues , cells , and DNA usually by chemical reactions or other activity on the molecular scales, when an organism is exposed to a sufficient quantity. [1] [2] The fields of medicine (particularly veterinary) and zoology often distinguish a poison from a toxin , and from a venom . Toxins are poisons produced by organisms in nature, and venoms are toxins injected by a bite or sting (this is exclusive to animals). The difference between venom and other poisons is the delivery method. Industry , agriculture , and other sectors employ poisonous substances for reasons other than their toxicity . Most poisonous industrial compounds have associated material safety data sheets and are classed as hazardous substances . Hazardous substances are subject to extensive regulation on production, procurement and use in overlapping domains of occupational safety and health , public health , drinking water quality standards , air pollution and environmental protection . Due to the mechanics of molecular diffusion , many poisonous compounds rapidly diffuse into biological tissues, air, water, or soil on a molecular scale. By the principle of entropy , chemical contamination is typically costly or infeasible to reverse, unless specific chelating agents or micro-filtration processes are available. Chelating agents are often broader in scope than the acute target, and therefore their ingestion necessitates careful medical or veterinarian supervision. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_food Raw foodism , also known as rawism or following a raw food diet , is the dietary practice of eating only or mostly food that is uncooked and unprocessed . Depending on the philosophy, or type of lifestyle and results desired, raw food diets may include a selection of fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, eggs, fish, meat, and dairy products. The diet may also include simply processed foods, such as various types of sprouted seeds , cheese , and fermented foods such as yogurts , kefir , kombucha , or sauerkraut , but generally not foods that have been pasteurized , homogenized , or produced with the use of synthetic pesticides , fertilizers , solvents , and food additives . The British Dietetic Association has described raw foodism as a fad diet . [1] [2] Raw food diets, specifically raw veganism, may diminish intake of essential minerals and nutrients, such as vitamin B 12 . [1] [3] [4] Claims held by raw food proponents are pseudoscientific . [5] : 44 Raw food diets are diets composed entirely or mostly of food that is uncooked or that is cooked at low temperatures. [3] [4] [6] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ritual_purification  Ritual purification is the ritual prescribed by a religion by which a person is considered to be free of uncleanliness , especially prior to the worship of a deity , and ritual purity is a state of ritual cleanliness . Ritual purification may also apply to objects and places. Ritual uncleanliness is not identical with ordinary physical impurity, such as dirt stains; nevertheless, body fluids are generally considered ritually unclean. Most of these rituals existed long before the germ theory of disease , and figure prominently from the earliest known religious systems of the Ancient Near East . Some writers connect the rituals to taboos . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_vaccine  A ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) vaccine or messenger RNA ( mRNA ) vaccine is a type of vaccine that uses a copy of a natural chemical called messenger RNA (mRNA) to produce an immune response. [1] The vaccine transfects molecules of synthetic RNA into immunity cells . Once inside the immune cells, the vaccine's RNA functions as mRNA, causing the cells to build the foreign protein that would normally be produced by a pathogen (such as a virus) or by a cancer cell. These protein molecules stimulate an adaptive immune response which teaches the body how to identify and destroy the corresponding pathogen or cancer cells. [1] The delivery of mRNA is achieved by a co-formulation of the molecule into lipid nanoparticles which protect the RNA strands and helps their absorption into the cells. [2] [3] Reactogenicity , the property of a vaccine of being able to produce common, expected adverse reactions, is similar to that of conventional non-RNA vaccines. [4] People susceptible to an autoimmune response may have an adverse reaction to RNA vaccines. [4] The advantages of RNA vaccines over traditional protein vaccines are superior design and production speed, lower cost of production, [5] [4] and the induction of both cellular as well as humoral immunity . [6] A disadvantage in the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine for COVID-19 is that it requires ultracold storage before distribution. [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturated_fat A saturated fat is a type of fat in which the fatty acid chains have all or predominantly single bonds .  A fat is made of two kinds of smaller molecules: glycerol and fatty acids . Fats are made of long chains of carbon (C) atoms. Some carbon atoms are linked by single bonds (-C-C-) and others are linked by double bonds (-C=C-). [1] Double bonds can react with hydrogen to form single bonds. They are called saturated because the second bond is broken and each half of the bond is attached to (saturated with) a hydrogen atom. Saturated fats tend to have higher melting points than their corresponding unsaturated fats, leading to the popular understanding that saturated fats tend to be solids at room temperatures, while unsaturated fats tend to be liquid at room temperature with varying degrees of viscosity. Most animal fats are saturated. The fats of plants and fish are generally unsaturated. [1] Various foods contain different proportions of saturated and unsaturated fat . Many processed foods like foods deep-fried in hydrogenated oil and sausage are high in saturated fat content. Some store-bought baked goods are as well, especially those containing partially hydrogenated oils . [2] [3] [4] Other examples of foods containing a high proportion of saturated fat and dietary cholesterol include animal fat products such as lard or schmaltz , fatty meats and dairy products made with whole or reduced fat milk like yogurt , ice cream , cheese and butter . [5] Certain vegetable products have high saturated fat content, such as coconut oil and palm kernel oil . [6] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauna  A sauna ( / ˈ s ɔː n ə , s aʊ -/ ; [1] [2] Finnish pronunciation: [ˈsɑunɑ] ), or sudatory , is a small room or building designed as a place to experience dry or wet heat sessions, or an establishment with one or more of these facilities. The steam and high heat make the bathers perspire. Infrared therapy is often referred to as a type of sauna, but according to the Finnish sauna organisations, infrared is not a sauna. [3] Tampere , the third-largest city of Finland , has been officially declared the "Sauna Capital of the World". [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_and_rescue Search and rescue ( SAR ) is the search for and provision of aid to people who are in distress or imminent danger. The general field of search and rescue includes many specialty sub-fields, typically determined by the type of terrain the search is conducted over. These include mountain rescue ; ground search and rescue, including the use of search and rescue dogs ; urban search and rescue in cities; combat search and rescue on the battlefield and air-sea rescue over water. International Search and Rescue Advisory Group (INSARAG) is a UN organization that promotes the exchange of information between national urban search and rescue organizations. The duty to render assistance is covered by Article 98 of the UNCLOS . There are many different definitions of search and rescue, depending on the agency involved and country in question. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)  Stress , either physiological , biological , or psychological is an organism's response to a stressor such as an environmental condition. [1] Stress is the body's method of reacting to a condition such as a threat, challenge or physical and psychological barrier. Stimuli that alter an organism's environment are responded to by multiple systems in the body. [2] In humans and most mammals, the autonomic nervous system and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis are the two major systems that respond to stress. [3] The sympathoadrenal medullary (SAM) axis may activate the fight-or-flight response through the sympathetic nervous system , which dedicates energy to more relevant bodily systems to acute adaptation to stress, while the parasympathetic nervous system returns the body to homeostasis. The second major physiological stress-response center, the HPA axis, regulates the release of cortisol , which influences many bodily functions such as metabolic, psychological and immunological functions . The SAM and HPA axes are regulated by several brain regions, including the limbic system , prefrontal cortex , amygdala , hypothalamus , and stria terminalis . [3] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_management Stress management is a wide spectrum of techniques and psychotherapies aimed at controlling a person's level of stress , especially chronic stress , usually for the purpose of and for the motive of improving everyday functioning. Stress produces numerous physical and mental symptoms which vary according to each individual's situational factors. These can include physical health decline as well as depression . The process of stress management is named as one of the keys to a happy and successful life in modern society. Although life provides numerous demands that can prove difficult to handle, stress management provides a number of ways to manage anxiety and maintain overall well-being. Despite stress often being thought of as a subjective experience, levels of stress are readily measurable, using various physiological tests, similar to those used in polygraphs . Evaluating the effectiveness of various stress management techniques can be difficult, as limited research currently exists. Consequently, the amount and quality of evidence for the various techniques varies widely. Some are accepted as effective treatments for use in psychotherapy, while others with less evidence favoring them are considered alternative therapies .  Many professional organizations exist to promote and provide training in conventional or alternative therapies. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_mask A surgical mask , also known as a medical face mask , is a personal protective equipment worn by health professionals during medical procedures . [1] [2] It prevents airborne transmission of infections between patients and/or treating personnel by blocking the movement of pathogens (primarily bacteria and viruses ) shed in respiratory droplets and aerosols into and from the wearer's mouth and nose . [3] [4] [5] Typically quite impermeable to moisture, the mask act as an additional barrier for the airway and are not usually designed (unless N95-rated ) to completely prevent the wearer from inhaling smaller airborne pathogens, but could be still protective by filtering out and trapping most of the droplets that carry them. [6] There is a predominance of evidence that surgical masks protect both the wearer (by filtering the inhaled air) and bystanders (by blocking down forceful exhalations from the wearer that can spread pathogens afar). [7] Surgical masks were originally designed to protect medical personnel from accidentally breathing or swallowing in splashes or sprays of bodily fluids , but the effectiveness of surgical masks against influenza -like infections has not been confirmed by high-quality randomized controlled trials . [8] Commonly seen surgical masks vary greatly by quality and levels of protection. Despite their name, not all surgical masks are appropriate to be used during surgery. Surgical masks may be labeled as surgical, isolation, dental or medical procedure masks. [9] Chinese health officials distinguish between medical (non-surgical) and surgical masks. [10] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacuinum_sanitatis Taqwīm as‑Siḥḥa ( تقويم الصحة Maintenance of Health ) is originally an eleventh-century Arab medical treatise by Ibn Butlan of Baghdad . [1] In the West, the work is known by the Latinized name taken by its translations: Tacuinum (sometimes Taccuinum ) Sanitatis . [2] It is a medieval handbook mainly on health , aimed at a cultured lay audience, the text exists in several variant Latin versions, the manuscripts of which are characteristically so profusely illustrated that one student called the Tacuinum "a [300] picture book", only "nominally a medical text". [3] Though describing in detail the beneficial and harmful properties of foods and plants, it is far more than a herbal . Listing its contents organically rather than alphabetically, it sets forth the six essential elements for well-being: Tacuinum Sanitatis says that illnesses result from imbalance of these elements. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirst Thirst is the craving for potable fluids, resulting in the basic instinct of animals to drink . It is an essential mechanism involved in fluid balance . [1] It arises from a lack of fluids or an increase in the concentration of certain osmolites , such as sodium . If the water volume of the body falls below a certain threshold or the osmolite concentration becomes too high, structures in the brain detect changes in blood constituents and signal thirst. [2] Continuous dehydration can cause acute and chronic diseases, but is most often associated with renal and neurological disorders. [1] Excessive thirst, called polydipsia , along with excessive urination, known as polyuria , may be an indication of diabetes mellitus or diabetes insipidus . There are receptors and other systems in the body that detect a decreased volume or an increased osmolite concentration. [1] [2] Some sources distinguish "extracellular thirst" from "intracellular thirst", where extracellular thirst is thirst generated by decreased volume and intracellular thirst is thirst generated by increased osmolite concentration. [2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(biology) Vector may refer to: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinary_medicine Veterinary medicine is the branch of medicine that deals with the prevention, control, diagnosis, and treatment of disease, disorder, and injury in animals . Along with this, it deals with animal rearing, husbandry, breeding, research on nutrition, and product development. The scope of veterinary medicine is wide, covering all animal species, both domesticated and wild , with a wide range of conditions that can affect different species. Veterinary medicine is widely practiced, both with and without professional supervision. Professional care is most often led by a veterinary physician (also known as a veterinarian, veterinary surgeon, or "vet"), but also by paraveterinary workers , such as veterinary nurses or technicians.  This can be augmented by other paraprofessionals with specific specialties, such as animal physiotherapy or dentistry , and species-relevant roles such as farriers . Veterinary science helps human health through the monitoring and control of zoonotic disease ( infectious disease transmitted from nonhuman animals to humans), food safety, and indirectly through human applications from basic medical research. They also help to maintain food supply through livestock health monitoring and treatment, and mental health by keeping pets healthy and long-living. Veterinary scientists often collaborate with epidemiologists and other health or natural scientists, depending on type of work. Ethically, veterinarians are usually obliged to look after animal welfare. Veterinarians diagnose, treat, and help keep animals safe and healthy. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ViSalus Vi (formerly ViSalus Sciences) [2] is an American multilevel marketing (MLM) company based in Los Angeles , California , with offices in Downtown Detroit , Michigan . [3] · The company is mostly known for the Body by Vi 90-Day Challenge platform. The company markets weight management nutritional products, dietary supplements and energy drinks in the United States, Canada, Italy and United Kingdom. [4] [5] Weight management products, including Vi-Shape meal replacement shake and Vi-Trim Clear Control Drink Mix, form the bulk of the company's sales. [6] Vi was originally started in 1997 by Nick Sarnicola and Blake Mallen, two distributors with The Free Network, LLC, a telecommunications MLM company based in Troy, Michigan . [3] After The Free Network folded in March 2005, Vi was purchased by wireless Internet developer Ryan Blair with investment from Ropart Asset Management, a private equity firm owned by Robert B. Goergen . Sarnicola and Mallen were retained as sales chief and CMO , respectively. The company was moved to the San Francisco Bay Area. [7] The 2008 recession put Vi near bankruptcy, with the business $6 million in debt. [8] In 2008, Vi was acquired by Blyth, Inc. , a multi-level marketing company that sells home decor which had been founded by Georgen. [7] In the first stage of the takeover – completed in 2008 – Blyth purchased a 43.6% equity interest for $14.0 million. [6] [9] By 2010 the company had returned to profitability, and Vi was making over $15 million a month. [10] Blyth  completed the second phase of the takeover in 2011, investing an additional $2.5 million and increasing their ownership share to 57.5%. [11] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_loss  Weight loss , in the context of medicine, health, or physical fitness , refers to a reduction of the total body mass , by a mean loss of fluid, body fat ( adipose tissue ), or lean mass (namely bone mineral deposits, muscle, tendon, and other connective tissue). Weight loss can either occur unintentionally because of malnourishment or an underlying disease, or from a conscious effort to improve an actual or perceived overweight or obese state.  "Unexplained" weight loss that is not caused by reduction in calorific intake or exercise is called cachexia and may be a symptom of a serious medical condition . Intentional weight loss is commonly referred to as slimming . Intentional weight loss is the loss of total body mass as a result of efforts to improve fitness and health, or to change appearance through slimming. Weight loss is the main treatment for obesity , [1] [2] [3] and there is substantial evidence this can prevent progression from prediabetes to type 2 diabetes with a 7-10% weight loss and manage cardiometabolic health for diabetic people with a 5-15% weight loss. [4] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yo-yo_effect Yo-yo dieting or yo-yo effect , also known as weight cycling , is a term coined by Kelly D. Brownell at Yale University , in reference to the cyclical loss and gain of weight, resembling the up-down motion of a yo-yo . In this process, the dieter is initially successful in the pursuit of weight loss but is unsuccessful in maintaining the loss long-term and begins to gain the weight back. The dieter then seeks to lose the regained weight, and the cycle begins again. The reasons for yo-yo dieting are varied but often include embarking upon a hypocaloric diet that was initially too extreme. At first the dieter may experience elation at the thought of weight loss and pride in their rejection of food. Over time, however, the limits imposed by such extreme diets cause effects such as depression or fatigue that make the diet impossible to sustain. Ultimately, the dieter reverts to their old eating habits , now with the added emotional effects of failing to lose weight by restrictive diet. Such an emotional state leads many people to eating more than they would have before dieting, causing them to rapidly regain weight. [1] The process of regaining weight and especially body fat is further promoted by the high metabolic plasticity of skeletal muscle. The Summermatter cycle [2] explains how skeletal muscle persistently reduces energy expenditure during dieting. In addition, food restriction increases physical activity which further supports body weight loss initially. Such weight regain in the form of preferential catch-up-fat is well documented after weight loss due to malnutrition, cancer, septic shock or AIDS and thus constitutes a general phenomenon related to weight loss. [2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine  Medicine is the science [1] and practice [2] of caring for a patient and managing the diagnosis , prognosis , prevention , treatment or palliation of their injury or disease . Medicine encompasses a variety of health care practices evolved to maintain and restore health by the prevention and treatment of illness . Contemporary medicine applies biomedical sciences , biomedical research , genetics , and medical technology to diagnose , treat, and prevent injury and disease, typically through pharmaceuticals or surgery , but also through therapies as diverse as psychotherapy , external splints and traction , medical devices , biologics , and ionizing radiation , amongst others. [3] Medicine has been practiced since prehistoric times , during most of which it was an art (an area of skill and knowledge) frequently having connections to the religious and philosophical beliefs of local culture. For example, a medicine man would apply herbs and say prayers for healing, or an ancient philosopher and physician would apply bloodletting according to the theories of humorism . In recent centuries, since the advent of modern science , most medicine has become a combination of art and science (both basic and applied , under the umbrella of medical science ). While stitching technique for sutures is an art learned through practice, the knowledge of what happens at the cellular and molecular level in the tissues being stitched arises through science. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1826%E2%80%931837_cholera_pandemic The second cholera pandemic (1826–1837), also known as the Asiatic cholera pandemic , was a cholera pandemic that reached from India across western Asia to Europe , Great Britain , and the Americas , as well as east to China and Japan . [1] Cholera caused more deaths, more quickly, than any other epidemic disease in the 19th century [ citation needed ] .   The medical community now believes cholera to be exclusively a human disease, spread through many means of travel during the time, and transmitted through warm fecal-contaminated river waters and contaminated foods. During the second pandemic, the scientific community varied in its beliefs about the causes of cholera. The first cholera pandemic (1817–24) began near Calcutta and spread throughout Southeast Asia to the Middle East, eastern Africa, and the Mediterranean coast. While cholera had spread across India many times previously, this outbreak went further; it reached as far as China and the Mediterranean Sea before receding. Hundreds of thousands of people died as a result of this pandemic , including many British soldiers , which attracted European attention. This was the first of several cholera pandemics to sweep through Asia and Europe during the 19th and 20th centuries. This first pandemic spread over an unprecedented range of territory, affecting almost every country in Asia. [ citation needed ] Historians believe that the first pandemic had lingered in Indonesia and the Philippines in 1830. [ citation needed ] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020%E2%80%9321_H5N8_outbreak In 2020 and 2021, an ongoing outbreak of Avian influenza subtype H5N8 has been occurring at poultry farms and among wild bird populations in several countries and continents, leading to the subsequent cullings of millions of birds to prevent a pandemic similar to that of the H5N1 outbreak in 2008 . The first case of human transmission was reported by Russian authorities in February 2021, as several poultry farm workers tested positive for the virus. On 4 February 2020, Saudi Arabian government reported an outbreak of the highly pathogenic H5N8 virus on a poultry farm. The outbreak, which occurred in the central Sudair region, killed more than 22,000 birds in a few weeks. [1] In the summer months, H5N8 was detected in wild birds in western Russia and Kazakhstan , because this included waterbirds that migrate into northern and western Europe, it was considered likely that the virus would be detected there later in the year (as would be confirmed in October–November). [2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbott_Laboratories  Abbott Laboratories is an American multinational medical devices and health care company with headquarters in Abbott Park, Illinois , United States. The company was founded by Chicago physician Wallace Calvin Abbott in 1888 to formulate known drugs; today, it sells medical devices, diagnostics, branded generic medicines and nutritional products. It split off its research-based pharmaceuticals business into AbbVie in 2013. Among its well-known products across the medical devices, diagnostics, and nutrition product divisions are Pedialyte , Similac , Ensure , Glucerna , ZonePerfect , FreeStyle Libre, i-STAT and MitraClip . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_obesity Abdominal obesity , also known as central obesity and truncal obesity , is a condition when excessive abdominal fat around the stomach and abdomen has built up to the extent that it is likely to have a negative impact on health. Abdominal obesity has been strongly linked to cardiovascular disease , [1] Alzheimer's disease , and other metabolic and vascular diseases . [2] Visceral and central abdominal fat and waist circumference show a strong association with type 2 diabetes . [3] Visceral fat , also known as organ fat or intra-abdominal fat , is located inside the peritoneal cavity , packed in between internal organs and torso , as opposed to subcutaneous fat , which is found underneath the skin , and intramuscular fat , which is found interspersed in skeletal muscle . Visceral fat is composed of several adipose depots including mesenteric , epididymal white adipose tissue (EWAT), and perirenal fat . An excess of adipose visceral fat is known as central obesity, the "pot belly" or "beer belly" effect, in which the abdomen protrudes excessively. This body type is also known as "apple shaped", as opposed to "pear shaped" in which fat is deposited on the hips and buttocks. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_pain  Abdominal pain , also known as a stomach ache , is a symptom associated with both non-serious and serious medical issues. Common causes of pain in the abdomen include gastroenteritis and irritable bowel syndrome . [2] About 15% of people have a more serious underlying condition such as appendicitis , leaking or ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm , diverticulitis , or ectopic pregnancy . [2] In a third of cases the exact cause is unclear. [2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ablutophobia   The English suffixes -phobia , -phobic , -phobe (from Greek φόβος phobos , "fear") occur in technical usage in psychiatry to construct words that describe irrational, abnormal , unwarranted, persistent, or disabling fear as a mental disorder (e.g. agoraphobia ), in chemistry to describe chemical aversions (e.g. hydrophobic ), in biology to describe organisms that dislike certain conditions (e.g. acidophobia ), and in medicine to describe hypersensitivity to a stimulus, usually sensory (e.g. photophobia ). In common usage, they also form words that describe dislike or hatred of a particular thing or subject (e.g. homophobia ). The suffix is antonymic to -phil- . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abrasion Abrasion may refer to: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acral_necrosis Acral necrosis is a symptom common in bubonic plague .  The striking black discoloration of skin and tissue, primarily on the extremities ("acral"), is commonly thought to have given rise to the name " Black Death ," associated both with the disease and the pandemic which occurred in the 14th century. The term in fact came from the figural sense of "black", that is ghastly, lugubrious or dreadful. [1] [2] Clotting and bleeding beneath the skin cause an area of haemorrhage, the presence of red blood cells lying outside of capillaries, into the skin and subcutaneous tissue.  In isolation, this is called an ecchymosis or bruise and may be the result of injury or illness.  However, acral necrosis occurs when blood supply is disrupted for prolonged periods, blackening and damaging the affected area and surrounding tissue.  With appropriate medical treatment, areas with acral necrosis may be successfully restored to function and lead a normal life.  Untreated cases can lead to death. [ citation needed ]  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrophobia Acrophobia is an extreme or irrational fear or phobia of heights, especially when one is not particularly high up. It belongs to a category of specific phobias , called space and motion discomfort, that share both similar causes and options for treatment. Most people experience a degree of natural fear when exposed to heights, known as the fear of falling . On the other hand, those who have little fear of such exposure are said to have a head for heights . A head for heights is advantageous for those hiking or climbing in mountainous terrain and also in certain jobs such as steeplejacks or wind turbine mechanics. People with acrophobia can experience a panic attack in high places and become too agitated to get themselves down safely. Approximately 2–5% of the general population has acrophobia, with twice as many women affected as men. [1] The term is from the Greek : ἄκρον , ákron , meaning "peak, summit, edge" and φόβος , phóbos , "fear". https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine) In medicine , describing a disease as acute denotes that it is of short duration and, as a corollary of that, of recent onset . The quantification of how much time constitutes "short" and "recent" varies by disease and by context, but the core denotation of "acute" is always qualitatively in contrast with " chronic ", which denotes long-lasting disease (for example, in acute leukaemia and chronic leukaemia ). In addition, "acute" also often connotes two other meanings: sudden onset and severity , such as in acute myocardial infarction (AMI), where suddenness and severity are both established aspects of the meaning. It thus often connotes that the condition is fulminant (as in the AMI example), but not always (as in acute rhinitis , which is usually synonymous with the common cold ). The one thing that acute MI and acute rhinitis have in common is that they are not chronic. They can happen again (as in recurrent pneumonia , that is, multiple acute pneumonia episodes), but they are not the same case ongoing for months or years (unlike chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , which is). A noncount sense of "acute disease" refers to the acute phase, that is, a short course, of any disease entity. [1] [2] For example, in an article on ulcerative enteritis in poultry , the author says, "in acute disease there may be increased mortality without any obvious signs ", [3] referring to the acute form or phase of ulcerative enteritis. Not all acute diseases or injuries are severe, and vice versa. For example, a mild stubbed toe is an acute injury. Similarly, many acute upper respiratory infections and acute gastroenteritis cases in adults are mild and usually resolve within a few days or weeks. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_myeloid_leukemia  Acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) is a cancer of the myeloid line of blood cells , characterized by the rapid growth of abnormal cells that build up in the bone marrow and blood and interfere with normal blood cell production . [1] Symptoms may include feeling tired, shortness of breath , easy bruising and bleeding, and increased risk of infection . [1] Occasionally, spread may occur to the brain, skin, or gums. [1] As an acute leukemia , AML progresses rapidly and is typically fatal within weeks or months if left untreated. [1] [6] Risk factors include smoking , previous chemotherapy or radiation therapy , myelodysplastic syndrome , and exposure to the chemical benzene . [1] The underlying mechanism involves replacement of normal bone marrow with leukemia cells , which results in a drop in red blood cells , platelets , and normal white blood cells . [1] Diagnosis is generally based on bone marrow aspiration and specific blood tests . [3] AML has several subtypes for which treatments and outcomes may vary. [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_radiation_syndrome Acute radiation syndrome ( ARS ), also known as radiation sickness or radiation poisoning , is a collection of health effects that are caused by being exposed to high amounts of ionizing radiation , in a short period of time. [1] The symptoms of ARS can start within the hour of exposure, and can last for several months. [1] [3] [5] Within the first few days the symptoms are usually nausea, vomiting and a loss of appetite. [1] In the following few hours or weeks will be a few symptoms, which later become additional symptoms, after which either recovery or death follow. [1] ARS involves a total dose of greater than 0.7 Gy (70 rad ), that generally occurs from a source outside the body, delivered within a few minutes. [1] Sources of such radiation can occur accidentally or intentionally. [6] They may involve nuclear reactors , cyclotrons , and certain devices used in cancer therapy . [4] It is generally divided into three types: bone marrow, gastrointestinal, and neurovascular syndrome, with bone marrow syndrome occurring at 0.7 to 10 Gy, and neurovascular syndrome occurring at doses that exceed 50 Gy. [1] [3] The cells that are most affected are generally those that are rapidly dividing. [3] At high doses, this causes DNA damage that may be irreparable. [4] Diagnosis is based on a history of exposure and symptoms. [4] Repeated complete blood counts (CBCs) can indicate the severity of exposure. [1] Treatment of ARS is generally supportive care . [3] This may include blood transfusions , antibiotics , colony-stimulating factors , or stem cell transplant . [3] Radioactive material remaining on the skin or in the stomach should be removed. [4] If radioiodine was inhaled or ingested, potassium iodide is recommended. [4] Complications like leukemia and other cancers among those who survive are managed as usual. [4] Short term outcomes depend on the dose exposure. [4] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_respiratory_distress_syndrome Acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) is a type of respiratory failure characterized by rapid onset of widespread inflammation in the lungs . [1] Symptoms include shortness of breath (dyspnea), rapid breathing (tachypnea), and bluish skin coloration (cyanosis). [1] For those who survive, a decreased quality of life is common. [3] Causes may include sepsis , pancreatitis , trauma , pneumonia , and aspiration . [1] The underlying mechanism involves diffuse injury to cells which form the barrier of the microscopic air sacs of the lungs , surfactant dysfunction, activation of the immune system , and dysfunction of the body's regulation of blood clotting . [4] In effect, ARDS impairs the lungs' ability to exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide . [1] Adult diagnosis is based on a PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio (ratio of partial pressure arterial oxygen and fraction of inspired oxygen) of less than 300 mm Hg despite a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of more than 5 cm H 2 O. [1] Cardiogenic pulmonary edema , as the cause, must be excluded. [3] The primary treatment involves mechanical ventilation together with treatments directed at the underlying cause. [1] Ventilation strategies include using low volumes and low pressures. [1] If oxygenation remains insufficient, lung recruitment maneuvers and neuromuscular blockers may be used. [1] If these are insufficient, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) may be an option. [1] The syndrome is associated with a death rate between 35 and 50%. [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adderall  Adderall and Mydayis [4] are trade names [note 2] for a combination drug containing four salts of amphetamine . The mixture is composed of equal parts racemic amphetamine and dextroamphetamine , which produces a (3:1) ratio between dextroamphetamine and levoamphetamine , the two enantiomers of amphetamine. Both enantiomers are stimulants , but differ enough to give Adderall an effects profile distinct from those of racemic amphetamine or dextroamphetamine, [1] [2] which are marketed as Evekeo and Dexedrine/Zenzedi, respectively. [1] [6] [7] Adderall is used in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy . It is also used as an athletic performance enhancer , cognitive enhancer , appetite suppressant , and recreationally as an aphrodisiac and euphoriant . It is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant of the phenethylamine class . [1] Adderall is generally well tolerated and effective in treating the symptoms of ADHD and narcolepsy. At therapeutic doses, Adderall causes emotional and cognitive effects such as euphoria , change in sex drive , increased wakefulness , and improved cognitive control . At these doses, it induces physical effects such as a faster reaction time, fatigue resistance, and increased muscle strength. In contrast, much larger doses of Adderall can impair cognitive control, cause rapid muscle breakdown , provoke panic attacks , or induce a psychosis (e.g., paranoia , delusions , hallucinations ). The side effects of Adderall vary widely among individuals, but most commonly include insomnia , dry mouth , loss of appetite , and weight loss . The risk of developing an addiction or dependence is insignificant when Adderall is used as prescribed at fairly low daily doses, such as those used for treating ADHD; however, the routine use of Adderall in larger daily doses poses a significant risk of addiction or dependence due to the pronounced reinforcing effects that are present at high doses. Recreational doses of amphetamine are generally much larger than prescribed therapeutic doses , and carry a far greater risk of serious adverse effects. [sources 1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenoidectomy Adenoidectomy is the surgical removal of the adenoid for reasons which include impaired breathing through the nose, chronic infections, or recurrent earaches. The effectiveness of removing the adenoids in children to improve recurrent nasal symptoms and/or nasal obstruction has not been well studied. [1] The surgery is less commonly performed in adults in whom the adenoid is much smaller and less active than it is in children. It is most often done on an outpatient basis under general anesthesia . Post-operative pain is generally minimal and reduced by icy or cold foods. The procedure is often combined with tonsillectomy (this combination is usually called an "adenotonsillectomy" or "T&A"), for which the recovery time is an estimated 10-14 days, sometimes longer, mostly dependent on age. Adenoidectomy is not often performed under one year of age as adenoid function is part of the body's immune system but its contribution to this decreases progressively beyond this age. The indications for adenoidectomy are still controversial. [2] [3] [4] Widest agreement surrounds the removal of the adenoid for obstructive sleep apnea, usually combined with tonsillectomy. [5] Even then, it has been observed that a significant percentage of the study population (18%) did not respond. There is also support for adenoidectomy in recurrent otitis media in children previously treated with tympanostomy tubes . [6] Finally, the effectiveness of adenoidectomy in children with recurrent upper respiratory tract infections, common cold, otitis media and moderate nasal obstruction has been questioned with the outcome, [1] in some studies, being no better than watchful waiting. [7] [8] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjustment_disorder Adjustment disorder is a maladaptive response to a psychosocial stressor that occurs when an individual has significant difficulty adjusting to or coping with a stressful psychosocial event. The maladaptive response usually involves otherwise normal emotional and behavioral reactions that manifest more intensely than usual (taking into account contextual and cultural factors), causing marked distress, preoccupation with the stressor and its consequences, and functional impairment. [2] [3] [4] [5] Diagnosis of AjD is quite common; there is an estimated incidence of 5–21% among psychiatric consultation services for adults. Adult women are diagnosed twice as often as are adult men. Among children and adolescents, girls and boys are equally likely to receive this diagnosis. [6] : 681 AjD was introduced into the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders in 1980. Prior to that, it was called "transient situational disturbance." [7] Some emotional signs of adjustment disorder are: sadness, hopelessness, lack of enjoyment, crying spells, nervousness, anxiety, desperation, feeling overwhelmed and thoughts of suicide, performing poorly in school/work etc. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenal_tumor An adrenal tumor or adrenal mass [2] is any benign or malignant neoplasms of the adrenal gland , several of which are notable for their tendency to overproduce endocrine hormones . Adrenal cancer is the presence of malignant adrenal tumors, and includes neuroblastoma , adrenocortical carcinoma and some adrenal pheochromocytomas . Most adrenal pheochromocytomas and all adrenocortical adenomas are benign tumors, which do not metastasize or invade nearby tissues, but may cause significant health problems by unbalancing hormones. Metastasis to one or both adrenal glands is the most common form of malignant adrenal lesion, and the second most common adrenal tumor after benign adenomas. [4] Primary tumors in such cases are most commonly from lung cancer (39%), breast cancer (35%), malignant melanoma , gastrointestinal tract cancer , pancreas cancer , and renal cancer . [4] The adrenal cortex is composed of three distinct layers of endocrine cells which produce critical steroid hormones . These include the glucocorticoids which are critical for regulation of blood sugar and the immune system , as well as response to physiological stress , the mineralcorticoid aldosterone , which regulates blood pressure and kidney function, and certain sex hormones . Both benign and malignant tumors of the adrenal cortex may produce steroid hormones, with important clinical consequences.

It is a result of fatty acid buildup caused by a defect in the very long chain of fatty acids transporter in peroxisomes, which then causes damage to the myelin sheath of the nerves , resulting in seizures and hyperactivity. Other symptoms include problems with speaking, listening, and understanding verbal instructions. In more detail, it is a disorder of peroxisomal fatty acid beta oxidation which results in the accumulation of very long chain fatty acids in tissues throughout the body.  The most severely affected tissues are the myelin in the central nervous system , the adrenal cortex , and the Leydig cells in the testes.  Clinically, ALD is a heterogeneous disorder, presenting with several distinct phenotypes , and no clear pattern of genotype -phenotype correlation.  As an X-linked disorder, ALD presents most commonly in males, however approximately 50% of heterozygote females show some symptoms later in life.  Approximately two-thirds of ALD patients will present with the childhood cerebral form of the disease, which is the most severe form.  It is characterized by normal development in early childhood, followed by rapid degeneration to a vegetative state .  The other forms of ALD vary in terms of onset and clinical severity, ranging from adrenal insufficiency to progressive paraparesis in early adulthood (this form of the disease is typically known as adrenomyeloneuropathy). ALD is caused by mutations in ABCD1 , a gene located on the X chromosome that codes for ALD, a peroxisomal membrane transporter protein.  The exact mechanism of the pathogenesis of the various forms of ALD is not known.  Biochemically, individuals with ALD show very high levels of unbranched, saturated, very long chain fatty acids, particularly cerotic acid (26:0).  The level of cerotic acid in plasma does not correlate with clinical presentation.  Treatment options for ALD are limited.  Dietary treatment is with Lorenzo's oil .  For the childhood cerebral form, stem cell transplant and gene therapy are options if the disease is detected early in the clinical course.  Adrenal insufficiency in ALD patients can be successfully treated.  ALD is the most common peroxisomal inborn error of metabolism, with an incidence estimated between 1:18,000 and 1:50,000.  It does not have a significantly higher incidence in any specific ethnic groups. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenomyeloneuropathy Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is a disease linked to the X chromosome .

[2] Diseases capable of airborne transmission include many of considerable importance both in human and veterinary medicine . The relevant pathogens may be viruses , bacteria , or fungi , and they may be spread through breathing, talking, coughing, sneezing, raising of dust, spraying of liquids, flushing toilets , or any activities which generate aerosol particles or droplets . Human airborne diseases do not include conditions caused by air pollution such as volatile organic compounds (VOCs), gases and any airborne particles. Airborne transmission traditionally has been considered distinct from transmission by droplets , based on misunderstandings of the physical behaviour of particles of various sizes. [3] Respiratory droplets were thought to be large enough to fall to the ground rapidly after being produced; [4] however, if particles of any size can be inhaled, they are essentially airborne particles. [3] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_hand_syndrome Alien hand syndrome ( AHS ) or Dr. Strangelove syndrome [1] is a category of conditions in which a person experiences their limbs acting seemingly on their own, without conscious control over the actions. [2] There are a variety of clinical conditions that fall under this category, which most commonly affects the left hand. [3] There are many similar terms for the various forms of the condition, but they are often used inappropriately. [4] The afflicted person may sometimes reach for objects and manipulate them without wanting to do so, even to the point of having to use the controllable hand to restrain the alien hand. [5] While under normal circumstances, thought, as intent, and action can be assumed to be deeply mutually entangled, the occurrence of alien hand syndrome can be usefully conceptualized as a phenomenon reflecting a functional "disentanglement" between thought and action. Alien hand syndrome is best documented in cases where a person has had the two hemispheres of their brain surgically separated , [ citation needed ] a procedure sometimes used to relieve the symptoms of extreme cases of epilepsy and epileptic psychosis , e.g., temporal lobe epilepsy . It also occurs in some cases after brain surgery , stroke , infection , tumor , aneurysm , migraine and specific degenerative brain conditions such as Alzheimer's disease , Corticobasal degeneration [6] and Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease . [ citation needed ] Other areas of the brain that are associated with alien hand syndrome are the frontal , occipital , and parietal lobes . [7] [8] [ unreliable medical source? ] "Alien behavior" can be distinguished from reflexive behavior in that the former is flexibly purposive while the latter is obligatory. Sometimes the sufferer will not be aware of what the alien hand is doing until it is brought to his or her attention, or until the hand does something that draws their attention to its behavior. There is a clear distinction between the behaviors of the two hands in which the affected hand is viewed as "wayward" and sometimes "disobedient" and generally out of the realm of their own voluntary control, while the unaffected hand is under normal volitional control. At times, particularly in patients who have sustained damage to the corpus callosum that connects the two cerebral hemispheres (see also split-brain ), the hands appear to be acting in opposition to each other. [9] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alprazolam  Alprazolam , sold under the brand name Xanax , among others, is a short-acting tranquilizer of the triazolobenzodiazepine (TBZD) class, which are benzodiazepines (BZDs) fused with a triazole ring. [6] It is most commonly used in short-term management of anxiety disorders , specifically panic disorder or generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). [7] Other uses include the treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea , together with other treatments. [5] GAD improvement occurs generally within a week. [8] [9] Alprazolam is generally taken by mouth . [5] Common side effects include sleepiness, depression, headaches, feeling tired, dry mouth , and memory problems . [5] Some of the sedation and tiredness may improve within a few days. [10] Due to concerns about misuse, some do not recommend alprazolam as an initial treatment for panic disorder. [11] Withdrawal or rebound symptoms may occur if use is suddenly decreased; [5] gradually decreasing the dose over weeks or months may be required. [8] Other rare risks include suicide , possibly due to loss of inhibition . [12] Alprazolam, like other benzodiazepines, acts through the GABA A receptor . [5] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine  Alternative medicine is any practice that aims to achieve the healing effects of medicine , but which lacks biological plausibility and is untested , untestable or proven ineffective. Complementary medicine ( CM ), complementary and alternative medicine ( CAM ), integrated medicine or integrative medicine ( IM ), and holistic medicine are among many rebrandings of the same phenomenon. Alternative therapies share in common that they reside outside medical science , and rely on pseudoscience . Traditional practices become "alternative" when used outside their original settings without proper scientific explanation and evidence. Frequently used derogatory terms for the alternative are new-age or pseudo , with little distinction from quackery . Some alternative practices are based on theories that contradict the science of how the human body works; others resort to the supernatural or superstitious to explain their effect. In others, the practice is plausibly effective but has too many side effects . Alternative medicine is distinct from scientific medicine, which employs the scientific method to test plausible therapies by way of responsible and ethical clinical trials , producing evidence of either effect or of no effect. Research into alternative therapies often fails to follow proper research protocols (such as placebo - controlled trials, blind experiments and calculation of prior probability ), providing invalid results. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aminoglycoside Aminoglycoside is a medicinal and bacteriologic category of traditional Gram-negative antibacterial medications that inhibit protein synthesis and contain as a portion of the molecule an amino-modified glycoside ( sugar ). [1] [2] The term can also refer more generally to any organic molecule that contains amino sugar substructures. Aminoglycoside antibiotics display bactericidal activity against Gram-negative aerobes and some anaerobic bacilli where resistance has not yet arisen but generally not against Gram-positive and anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria. [3] Streptomycin is the first-in-class aminoglycoside antibiotic . It is derived from Streptomyces griseus and is the earliest modern agent used against tuberculosis . Streptomycin lacks the common 2-deoxystreptamine moiety (image right, below) present in most other members of this class. Other examples of aminoglycosides include the deoxystreptamine-containing agents kanamycin , tobramycin , gentamicin , and neomycin (see below). Aminoglycosides that are derived from bacteria of the Streptomyces genus are named with the suffix -mycin , whereas those that are derived from Micromonospora [4] are named with the suffix -micin . [5] However, this nomenclature system is not specific for aminoglycosides, and so appearance of this set of suffixes does not imply common mechanism of action. (For instance, vancomycin , a glycopeptide antibiotic , [6] and erythromycin , [7] a macrolide antibiotic produced by Saccharopolyspora erythraea , along with its synthetic derivatives clarithromycin and azithromycin , all share the suffixes but have notably different mechanisms of action.) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amniocentesis Amniocentesis (also referred to as an amniotic fluid test or, informally, an " amnio ") is a medical procedure [note 1] used primarily in prenatal diagnosis of chromosomal abnormalities and fetal infections [1] as well as for sex determination . In this procedure, a small amount of amniotic fluid , which contains fetal tissues, is sampled from the amniotic sac surrounding a developing fetus . The fetal DNA is then examined for genetic abnormalities. The most common reason to have an amniocentesis performed is to determine whether a fetus has certain genetic disorders or a chromosomal abnormality, such as Down syndrome . Amniocentesis (or another procedure, called chorionic villus sampling (CVS)) can diagnose these problems in the womb. [2] These prenatal examinations can prove helpful to expectant guardians, as they allow for evaluating the fetal health status and the feasibility of treatment. [3] An amniocentesis is performed when a woman is between 15 and 20 weeks gestation. [4] Women who choose to have this test are primarily those at increased risk for genetic and chromosomal problems, in part because the test is invasive and carries a small risk of miscarriage . [4] This process can be used for prenatal sex discernment and hence this procedure has legal restrictions in some countries. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphetamine  Amphetamine [note 2] (contracted from a lpha - m ethyl ph en et hyl amine ) is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant that is used in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), narcolepsy , and obesity . Amphetamine was discovered in 1887 and exists as two enantiomers : [note 3] levoamphetamine and dextroamphetamine . Amphetamine properly refers to a specific chemical, the racemic free base , which is equal parts of the two enantiomers, levoamphetamine and dextroamphetamine, in their pure amine forms. The term is frequently used informally to refer to any combination of the enantiomers, or to either of them alone. Historically, it has been used to treat nasal congestion and depression. Amphetamine is also used as an athletic performance enhancer and cognitive enhancer , and recreationally as an aphrodisiac and euphoriant . It is a prescription drug in many countries, and unauthorized possession and distribution of amphetamine are often tightly controlled due to the significant health risks associated with recreational use . [sources 1] The first amphetamine pharmaceutical was Benzedrine , a brand which was used to treat a variety of conditions. Currently, pharmaceutical amphetamine is prescribed as racemic amphetamine, Adderall , [note 4] dextroamphetamine , or the inactive prodrug lisdexamfetamine . Amphetamine increases monoamine and excitatory neurotransmission in the brain, with its most pronounced effects targeting the norepinephrine and dopamine neurotransmitter systems . [sources 2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amputation Physical medicine and rehabilitation Amputation is the removal of a limb by trauma , medical illness , or surgery . As a surgical measure, it is used to control pain or a disease process in the affected limb, such as malignancy or gangrene . In some cases, it is carried out on individuals as a preventive surgery for such problems. A special case is that of congenital amputation , a congenital disorder , where fetal limbs have been cut off by constrictive bands. In some countries, such as the United States [1] [2] and Iran, [3] amputation was proposed, was formerly used, or is currently used to punish people who committed crimes. [4] [5] [6] Amputation has also been used as a tactic in war and acts of terrorism; it may also occur as a war injury. In some cultures and religions, minor amputations or mutilations are considered a ritual accomplishment. [7] [8] [9] When done by a person, the person executing the amputation is an amputator. [10] The amputated person is called an amputee. [11] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloidosis Amyloidosis is a group of diseases in which abnormal proteins , known as amyloid fibrils , build up in tissue. [4] There are several types with varying symptoms; signs and symptoms may include diarrhea , weight loss, feeling tired, enlargement of the tongue, bleeding, numbness, feeling faint with standing , swelling of the legs, or enlargement of the spleen. [2] There are about 30 different types of amyloidosis, each due to a specific protein misfolding . [5] Some are genetic while others are acquired. [3] They are grouped into localized forms , and systemic ones. [2] The four most common types of systemic amyloidosis are light chain (AL) , inflammation ( AA ), dialysis-related (Aβ 2 M), and hereditary and old age ( ATTR and familial amyloid polyneuropathy [6] ). [2] Diagnosis may be suspected when protein is found in the urine , organ enlargement is present, or problems are found with multiple peripheral nerves and it is unclear why. [2] Diagnosis is confirmed by tissue biopsy . [2] Due to the variable presentation, a diagnosis can often take some time to reach. [3] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analgesic An analgesic or painkiller is any member of the group of drugs used to achieve analgesia, relief from pain . They are distinct from anesthetics , which temporarily affect, and in some instances completely eliminate, sensation . Analgesic choice is also determined by the type of pain: For neuropathic pain , traditional analgesics are less effective, and there is often benefit from classes of drugs that are not normally considered analgesics, such as tricyclic antidepressants and anticonvulsants . [1] Analgesics are typically classified based on their mechanism of action. [2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_psychology Analytical psychology ( German : Analytische Psychologie , sometimes translated as analytic psychology and referred to as Jungian analysis ) is a term coined by Carl Jung , a Swiss psychiatrist , to describe research into his new "empirical science" of the psyche. It was designed to distinguish it from Freud's psychoanalytic theories as their seven-year collaboration on psychoanalysis was drawing to an end between 1912 and 1913. [1] [2] [3] The evolution of his science is contained in his monumental opus , the Collected Works , written over sixty years of his lifetime. [4] The history of analytical psychology is intimately linked with the biography of Jung. At the start, it was known as the "Zurich school", whose chief figures were Eugen Bleuler , Franz Riklin , Alphonse Maeder and Jung, all centred in the Burghölzli hospital in Zurich. It was initially a theory concerning psychological complexes until Jung, upon breaking with Sigmund Freud , turned it into a generalised method of investigating archetypes and the unconscious , as well as into a specialised psychotherapy . Analytical psychology, or "complex psychology", from the German : Komplexe Psychologie , is the foundation of many developments in the study and practice of Psychology as of other disciplines. The followers of Jung are many, and some of them are members of national societies in diverse countries around the world. They collaborate professionally on an international level through the International Association of Analytical Psychologists (IAAP) and the International Association for Jungian Studies (IAJS). Jung's propositions have given rise to a rich and multidisciplinary literature in numerous languages. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaphia Anaphia , also known as tactile anesthesia , is a medical symptom in which there is a total or partial absence of the sense of touch. [1] Anaphia is a common symptom of spinal cord injury and neuropathy .  This medical symptom article is a stub . You can help Wikipedia by expanding it . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaphrodisiac An anaphrodisiac (also antaphrodisiac or antiaphrodisiac ) is a substance that quells or blunts the libido . It is the opposite of an aphrodisiac , something that enhances sexual appetite. The word anaphrodisiac comes from the Greek privative prefix ἀν- , denoting negation, and aphrodisiac , from the Greek goddess of love, Aphrodite . Some people use anaphrodisiacs in order to curb a very high libido or due to hypersexuality . [1] However anaphrodisiacs are also used by those with an average libido, at times due to having incessant schedules. [2] Some common anaphrodisiacs are ethanol (alcohol) and tobacco , but this is typically an unintended consequence and not often the main reason for use. While alcohol is used socially because it initially reduces mental inhibitions, studies have shown that over time alcohol physically decreases arousal and makes achieving climax more difficult. [3] For this reason alcohol is considered an anaphrodisiac. Opioids , the class of pain-reducing substances which include morphine , heroin , and hydrocodone , are anaphrodisiacs. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesiologist Anesthesiology , anaesthesiology , anaesthesia or anaesthetics (see Terminology ) is the medical specialty concerned with the total perioperative care of patients before, during and after surgery . [1] It encompasses anesthesia , intensive care medicine , critical emergency medicine , and pain medicine . [2] A physician specialized in this field of medicine is called an anesthesiologist , anaesthesiologist or anaesthetist , depending on the country (see Terminology ). [3] [4] [5] [6] The core element of the specialty is the study and use of anesthesia and anesthetics to safely support a patient's vital functions through the perioperative period. Since the 19th century, anesthesiology has developed from an experimental area with non-specialist practitioners using novel, untested drugs and techniques into what is now a highly refined, safe and effective field of medicine. In some countries  anesthesiologists comprise the largest single cohort of doctors in hospitals, [7] [8] and their role can extend far beyond the traditional role of anesthesia care in the operating room , including fields such as providing pre-hospital emergency medicine , running intensive care units , transporting critically ill patients between facilities, and prehabilitation programs to optimize patients for surgery. [7] The word "anaesthesia" appears to have first been used in the modern medical sense of the word by Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. in 1846, and it gained currency when adopted by James Young Simpson the following year. "Anesthesiology" was proposed in 1889 by Henry William Blanc, and was re-coined by Mathias Joseph Seifert in 1902. [9] The name derives from  the Ancient Greek roots ἀν- an- , "not", αἴσθησις aísthēsis , “sensation”, and -λογία -logia , "study". https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthetic  An anesthetic ( American English ) or anaesthetic ( British English ; see spelling differences ) is a drug used to induce anesthesia ⁠— ⁠in other words, to result in a temporary loss of sensation or awareness . They may be divided into two broad classes: general anesthetics , which result in a reversible loss of consciousness , and local anesthetics , which cause a reversible loss of sensation for a limited region of the body without necessarily affecting consciousness. A wide variety of drugs are used in modern anesthetic practice.  Many are rarely used outside anesthesiology , but others are used commonly in various fields of healthcare. Combinations of anesthetics are sometimes used for their synergistic and additive therapeutic effects. Adverse effects, however, may also be increased. [1] Anesthetics are distinct from analgesics , which block only sensation of painful stimuli. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography Angiography or arteriography is a medical imaging technique used to visualize the inside, or lumen , of blood vessels and organs of the body, with particular interest in the arteries , veins , and the heart chambers . This is traditionally done by injecting a radio-opaque contrast agent into the blood vessel and imaging using X-ray based techniques such as fluoroscopy . The word itself comes from the Greek words ἀγγεῖον angeion 'vessel' and γράφειν graphein 'to write, record'. The film or image of the blood vessels is called an angiograph , or more commonly an angiogram . Though the word can describe both an arteriogram and a venogram , in everyday usage the terms angiogram and arteriogram are often used synonymously, whereas the term venogram is used more precisely. [1] The term angiography has been applied to radionuclide angiography and newer vascular imaging techniques such as CO 2 angiography , CT angiography and MR angiography . [2] The term isotope angiography has also been used, although this more correctly is referred to as isotope perfusion scanning . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_euthanasia  Animal euthanasia ( euthanasia from Greek : εὐθανασία ; "good death") is the act of killing an animal or allowing it to die by withholding extreme medical measures. Reasons for euthanasia include incurable (and especially painful) conditions or diseases, [1] lack of resources to continue supporting the animal, or laboratory test procedures. Euthanasia methods are designed to cause minimal pain and distress. Euthanasia is distinct from animal slaughter and pest control although in some cases the procedure is the same. In domesticated animals, this process is commonly referred to by euphemisms such as "put down" [2] or "put to sleep". [3] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankylosing_spondylitis  Ankylosing spondylitis ( AS ) is a type of arthritis in which there is a long-term inflammation of the joints of the spine . [2] Typically the joints where the spine joins the pelvis are also affected. [2] Occasionally other joints such as the shoulders or hips are involved. [2] Eye and bowel problems may also occur. [2] Back pain is a characteristic symptom of AS, and it often comes and goes. [2] Stiffness of the affected joints generally worsens over time. [2] [4] Although the cause of ankylosing spondylitis is unknown, it is believed to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors. [2] More than 85% of those affected in the UK have a specific human leukocyte antigen known as the HLA-B27 antigen. [5] The underlying mechanism is believed to be autoimmune or autoinflammatory . [6] Diagnosis is typically based on the symptoms with support from medical imaging and blood tests . [2] AS is a type of seronegative spondyloarthropathy , meaning that tests show no presence of rheumatoid factor (RF) antibodies . [2] It is also within a broader category known as axial spondyloarthritis . [7] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antacid An antacid is a substance which neutralizes stomach acidity and is used to relieve heartburn , indigestion or an upset stomach. [1] Some antacids have been used in the treatment of constipation and diarrhea . [2] Currently marketed antacids contain salts of aluminum , calcium , magnesium , or sodium . [2] Some preparations contain a combination of two salts, such as magnesium carbonate and aluminum hydroxide . [3] Antacids are available over the counter and are taken by mouth to quickly relieve occasional heartburn , the major symptom of gastroesophageal reflux disease and indigestion . Treatment with antacids alone is symptomatic and only justified for minor symptoms. [4] Alternative uses for antacids include constipation, diarrhea,  hyperphosphatemia, and urinary alkalization. [5] Some antacids are also used as an adjunct to pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy in the treatment of pancreatic insufficiency . [6] Non-particulate antacids ( sodium citrate , magnesium trisilicate ) increase gastric pH with little or no effect on gastric volume, and therefore may see some limited use in pre-operative procedures. Sodium citrate should be given within 1 hour of surgery to be the most effective. [7] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticoagulant Anticoagulants , commonly known as blood thinners , are chemical substances that prevent or reduce coagulation of blood , prolonging the clotting time . [1] Some of them occur naturally in blood-eating animals such as leeches and mosquitoes , where they help keep the bite area unclotted long enough for the animal to obtain some blood. [2] [3] As a class of medications , anticoagulants are used in therapy for thrombotic disorders . [4] Oral anticoagulants (OACs) are taken by many people in pill or tablet form, and various intravenous anticoagulant dosage forms are used in hospitals. [5] [6] Some anticoagulants are used in medical equipment, such as sample tubes, blood transfusion bags, heart-lung machines , and dialysis equipment. [7] [8] One of the first anticoagulants, warfarin, was initially approved as a rodenticide . [9] Anticoagulants are closely related to antiplatelet drugs and thrombolytic drugs by manipulating the various pathways of blood coagulation. [10] Specifically, antiplatelet drugs inhibit platelet aggregation (clumping together), whereas anticoagulants inhibit specific pathways of the coagulation cascade, which happens after the initial platelet aggregation and ultimately leads to formation of fibrin and stable aggregated platelet products. [11] [12] Common anticoagulants include warfarin and heparin . [13] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimony_pill An antimony pill is a pill made from metallic antimony . It was a popular remedy in the nineteenth century, and it was used to purge and revitalise the bowels. In use, it is swallowed and allowed to pass through the body, after which it is customarily recovered for reuse, giving rise to the name everlasting pill . The antimonial cup yielded the same effect. [1] According to the Medico-Pharmaceutical Critic and Guide (1907), edited by William J. Robinson : We have     referred in the past to the economy which used to be practiced by our fore-fathers. Thus, for instance, it was customary to use leeches over and over again and there are instances of infection with syphilis by leeches that had been previously used on luetic patients. But we believe that the everlasting cathartic pill beats everything in the line of economy. This pill was a little bullet composed of metallic antimony which had or was believed to have the property of purging as often as it was swallowed. It is not inconceivable that it might have had such property, for it is possible that a minute amount was dissolved by the gastro-intestinal juices and this amount, plus the suggestion, was sufficient to produce cathartic action. Then again the everlasting pill probably aided peristalsis by its mechanical weight and motion. The bullet was passed out, recovered from the feces and used over and over again. This, as Dr. J. A. Paris says, was economy in right earnest, for a single pill would serve a whole family during their lives and might be transmitted as an heirloom to posterity. [2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiplatelet_drug An antiplatelet drug (antiaggregant), also known as a platelet agglutination inhibitor or platelet aggregation inhibitor , is a member of a class of pharmaceuticals that decrease platelet aggregation [1] and inhibit thrombus formation. They are effective in the arterial circulation where anticoagulants have little effect. [ citation needed ] They are widely used in primary and secondary prevention of thrombotic cerebrovascular or cardiovascular disease. Antiplatelet therapy with one or more of these drugs decreases the ability of blood clots to form by interfering with the platelet activation process in primary hemostasis . [2] Antiplatelet drugs can reversibly or irreversibly inhibit the process involved in platelet activation resulting in decreased tendency of platelets to adhere to one another and to damaged blood vessels' endothelium. [2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipsychotic  Antipsychotics , also known as neuroleptics , [1] are a class of psychotropic medication primarily used to manage psychosis (including delusions , hallucinations , paranoia or disordered thought ), principally in schizophrenia but also in a range of other psychotic disorders. [2] They are also the mainstay together with mood stabilizers in the treatment of bipolar disorder . [3] Recent research has shown that use of any antipsychotic results in smaller brain tissue volumes and that this brain shrinkage is dose dependent and time dependent. [4] A review of the research has also reinforced this effect. [5] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiseptic Antiseptics (from Greek ἀντί anti , "against" [1] and σηπτικός sēptikos , "putrefactive" [2] ) are antimicrobial substances that are applied to living tissue / skin to reduce the possibility of infection , sepsis , or putrefaction . Antiseptics are generally distinguished from antibiotics by the latter's ability to safely destroy bacteria within the body, and from disinfectants , which destroy microorganisms found on non-living objects. [3] Some antiseptics are true germicides , capable of destroying microbes ( bacteriocidal ), while others are bacteriostatic and only prevent or inhibit their growth. [4] Antibacterials include antiseptics that have the proven ability to act against bacteria. Microbicides which destroy virus particles are called viricides or antivirals . Antifungals , also known as antimycotics , are pharmaceutical fungicides used to treat and prevent mycosis (fungal infection). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antivenom Antivenom , also known as antivenin , venom antiserum , and antivenom immunoglobulin , is a specific treatment for envenomation . It is composed of antibodies and used to treat certain venomous bites and stings. [1] Antivenoms are recommended only if there is significant toxicity or a high risk of toxicity. [1] The specific antivenom needed depends on the species involved. [1] It is given by injection. [1] Side effects may be severe. [1] They include serum sickness , shortness of breath , and allergic reactions including anaphylaxis . [1] Antivenom is traditionally made by collecting venom from the relevant animal and injecting small amounts of it into a domestic animal. [2] The antibodies that form are then collected from the domestic animal's blood and purified. [2] Versions are available for spider bites , snake bites , fish stings , and scorpion stings . [3] Due to the high cost of producing antibody-based antivenoms and their short shelf lives when not refrigerated, alternative methods of production of antivenoms are being actively explored. [4] One such different method of production involves production from bacteria. [5] Another approach is to develop targeted drugs (which, unlike antibodies, are usually synthetic and easier to manufacture at scale). [6] Antivenom was first developed in the late 19th century and came into common use in the 1950s. [2] [7] It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines . [8] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiolytic  An anxiolytic ( / ˌ æ ŋ k s i ə ˈ l ɪ t ɪ k , ˌ æ ŋ k s i oʊ -/ ; also antipanic or antianxiety agent ) [1] is a medication, or other intervention, that reduces anxiety . This effect is in contrast to anxiogenic agents, which increase anxiety.  Anxiolytic medications have been used for the treatment of anxiety disorder and its related psychological and physical symptoms. Light therapy and other interventions have also been found to have an anxiolytic effect. [2] Beta-receptor blockers such as propranolol and oxprenolol are sometimes used to combat the somatic symptoms of anxiety such as tachycardia and palpitations . [3] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appendectomy An appendectomy , also termed appendicectomy , is a surgical operation in which the vermiform appendix (a portion of the intestine) is removed. Appendectomy is normally performed as an urgent or emergency procedure to treat complicated acute appendicitis . [1] Appendectomy may be performed laparoscopically (as minimally invasive surgery ) or as an open operation. [2] Over the 2010s, surgical practice has increasingly moved towards routinely offering laparoscopic appendicectomy; for example in the United Kingdom over 95% of adult appendicectomies are planned as laparoscopic procedures. [3] Laparoscopy is often used if the diagnosis is in doubt, or in order to leave a less visible surgical scar. Recovery may be slightly faster after laparoscopic surgery, although the laparoscopic procedure itself is more expensive and resource-intensive than open surgery and generally takes longer. Advanced pelvic sepsis occasionally requires a lower midline laparotomy . Both uncomplicated (non-perforated) and complicated (perforated) appendicitis should undergo prompt surgical intervention. [1] The difference in treatment occurs post-operatively with respect to the length of time the antibiotics are administered. For uncomplicated appendicitis, antibiotics should be continued up to 24 hours post-operatively. For complicated appendicitis, antibiotics should be continued for anywhere between 3 and 7 days. [1] An interval appendectomy is generally performed 6-8 weeks after conservative management with antibiotics for special cases, such as perforated appendicitis. [4] Delay of appendectomy 24 hours after admission for symptoms of appendicitis has not shown to increase risk of perforation or other complications. [5] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon_plasma_coagulation Argon plasma coagulation ( APC ) is a medical endoscopic procedure used to control bleeding from certain lesions in the gastrointestinal tract . It is administered during esophagogastroduodenoscopy or colonoscopy . APC involves the use of a jet of ionized argon gas ( plasma ) directed through a probe passed through the endoscope . The probe is placed at some distance from the bleeding lesion, and argon gas is emitted, then ionized by a high-voltage discharge (approx 6 kV ). [1] High-frequency electric current is then conducted through the jet of gas, resulting in coagulation of the bleeding lesion. As no physical contact is made with the lesion, the procedure is safe if the bowel has been cleaned of colonic gases, [2] [3] and can be used to treat bleeding in parts of the gastrointestinal tract with thin walls, such as the cecum . The depth of coagulation is usually only a few millimetres. APC is used to treat the following conditions: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aripiprazole Aripiprazole , sold under the brand name Abilify among others, is an atypical antipsychotic . [5] It is primarily used in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder . [5] Other uses include as an add-on treatment in major depressive disorder , tic disorders and irritability associated with autism . [5] It is taken by mouth or injection into a muscle . [5] A Cochrane review found evidence of effectiveness in treating schizophrenia. [6] In adults, side effects with greater than 10% incidence include weight gain, headache, akathisia , insomnia, and gastro-intestinal effects like nausea and constipation, and lightheadedness. [2] [3] [4] [7] [8] Side effects in children are similar, and include sleepiness, increased appetite, and stuffy nose. [7] A strong desire to gamble, binge eat, shop, and engage in sexual activity may also occur. [9] [10] Common side effects include vomiting, constipation, sleepiness, dizziness, weight gain and movement disorders . [5] Serious side effects may include neuroleptic malignant syndrome , tardive dyskinesia and anaphylaxis . [5] It is not recommended for older people with dementia -related psychosis due to an increased risk of death. [5] In pregnancy , there is evidence of possible harm to the baby. [5] [11] It is not recommended in women who are breastfeeding . [5] It has not been very well studied in people less than 18 years old. [5] The exact mode of action is not entirely clear but may involve effects on dopamine and serotonin . [5] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arteriovenous_malformation Arteriovenous malformation is an abnormal connection between arteries and veins , bypassing the capillary system . This vascular anomaly is widely known because of its occurrence in the central nervous system (usually cerebral AVM ), but can appear in any location. Although many AVMs are asymptomatic, they can cause intense pain or bleeding or lead to other serious medical problems. AVMs are usually congenital and belong to the RASopathies . The genetic transmission patterns of AVMs are incomplete, but there are known genetic mutations (for instance in the epithelial line, tumor suppressor PTEN gene) which can lead to an increased occurrence throughout the body. Symptoms of AVM vary according to the location of the malformation. Roughly 88% [1] of people with an AVM are asymptomatic; often the malformation is discovered as part of an autopsy or during treatment of an unrelated disorder (called in medicine an "incidental finding"); in rare cases, its expansion or a micro-bleed from an AVM in the brain can cause epilepsy, neurological deficit, or pain. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_pacemaker A cardiac pacemaker (or artificial pacemaker , so as not to be confused with the natural pacemaker of the heart ), is a medical device that generates electrical impulses delivered by electrodes to cause the heart muscle chambers (the upper, or atria and/or the lower, or ventricles ) to contract and therefore pump blood; by doing so this device replaces and/or regulates the function of the electrical conduction system of the heart . The primary purpose of a pacemaker is to maintain an adequate heart rate , either because the heart's natural pacemaker is not fast enough, or because there is a block in the heart's electrical conduction system. Modern pacemakers are externally programmable and allow a cardiologist, particularly a cardiac electrophysiologist to select the optimal pacing modes for individual patients.  Modern devices are demand pacemakers , in which the stimulation of the heart is based on the dynamic demand of the circulatory system . [1] [2] A specific type of pacemaker called a defibrillator combines pacemaker and defibrillator functions in a single implantable device, which should be called a defibrillator, for clarity. Others, called biventricular pacemakers have multiple electrodes stimulating differing positions within the lower heart chambers to improve synchronization of the ventricles , the lower chambers of the heart. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asepsis Asepsis is the state of being free from disease-causing micro-organisms (such as pathogenic bacteria , viruses , pathogenic fungi , and parasites ). [1] There are two categories of asepsis: medical and surgical. [1] The modern day notion of asepsis is derived from the older antiseptic techniques, a shift initiated by different individuals in the 19th century who introduced practices such as the sterilizing of surgical tools and the wearing of surgical gloves during operations. [2] The goal of asepsis is to eliminate infection, not to achieve sterility. [1] Ideally, a surgical field is sterile , meaning it is free of all biological contaminants (e.g. fungi, bacteria, viruses), not just those that can cause disease, putrefaction , or fermentation . [1] Even in an aseptic state, a condition of sterile inflammation may develop. The term often refers to those practices used to promote or induce asepsis in an operative field of surgery or medicine to prevent infection . [3] The modern concept of asepsis evolved in the 19th century through multiple individuals. Ignaz Semmelweis showed that hand washing prior to delivery reduced puerperal fever . Despite this, many hospitals continued to practice surgery in unsanitary conditions, wit h some surgeons taking pride in their bloodstained operating gowns. [4] It was not until after reading of the findings by Louis Pasteur that Joseph Lister introduced the use of carbolic acid as an antiseptic, and in doing so, reduced surgical infection rates. [5] Lawson Tait shifted the movement then from antisepsis to asepsis, instilling practices such as a strict no-talking policy within his operating room and drastically limiting the number of people to come in contact with a patient's wound. [6] Ernst von Bergmann also introduced the autoclave , a device used for the practice of the sterilization of surgical instruments. [7] But, everything from operating room uniforms to gloves was pioneered by William Halsted . Preceding modern-day scrubs attire, Halsted implemented a no street clothes policy in his operating room, opting to wear a completely white, sterile uniform consisting of a duck suit , tennis shoes , and skullcap . [2] This helped to prevent the introduction of infections into open wounds. [2] Additionally, Halsted would sterilize the operation site with alcohol, iodine and other disinfectants and use drapes to cover all areas except for the site. [2] In his department at Johns Hopkins Hospital , he enforced an extreme hand washing ritual consisting of soaking in harmfully strong chemicals like permanganate and mercury bichloride solution as well as scrubbing with stiff brushes. [2] The damage to a surgical nurse's hands compelled him to create the earliest form of the surgical gloves with the Goodyear Rubber Company . [2] These gloves became a part of the aseptic surgery standard when Dr. Joseph Colt Bloodgood and several others began wearing them for that particular purpose. [8] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assisted_suicide  Assisted suicide , also known as assisted dying or medical aid in dying , is suicide undertaken with the aid of another person. [1] The term usually refers to physician-assisted suicide ( PAS ), which is suicide that is assisted by a physician or other healthcare provider. Once it is determined that the person's situation qualifies under the physician-assisted suicide laws for that place, the physician's assistance is usually limited to writing a prescription for a lethal dose of drugs. In many jurisdictions, helping a person die by suicide is a crime . [2] People who support legalizing physician-assisted suicide want the people who assist in a voluntary death to be exempt from criminal prosecution for manslaughter or similar crimes. Physician-assisted suicide is legal in some countries, under certain circumstances, including Canada , Belgium , the Netherlands , Luxembourg , Spain , Switzerland , Germany , parts of the United States ( California , Colorado , Hawaii , Maine , Montana , New Jersey , Oregon , Vermont , Washington and Washington, D.C. ) and Australia ( Tasmania , Victoria and Western Australia ). The Constitutional Court of Austria and Colombia legalized assisted suicide, but their governments have not legislated or regulated the practice yet. New Zealand legalized assisted suicide in a referendum in 2020 , but it will come into force on 6 November 2021. The parliament of Portugal passed the legalization of assisted suicide, but is now under consideration of the Constitutional Court. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augusta_Victoria_Hospital Coordinates : 31°47′12″N 35°14′57″E ﻿ / ﻿ 31.78667°N 35.24917°E ﻿ / 31.78667; 35.24917 Augusta Victoria Compound is a church-hospital complex on the northern side [1] of Mount of Olives in East Jerusalem and one of six hospitals in the East Jerusalem Hospitals Network . The compound was built in 1907–1914 by the Empress Augusta Victoria Foundation as a center for the German Protestant community in Ottoman Palestine , in addition to the slightly older Church of the Redeemer from Jerusalem's Old City . Apart from the hospital, today the complex also includes the German Protestant [2] Church of the Ascension with a c. 50 metre high belltower , a meeting centre for pilgrims and tourists, an interreligious kindergarten and a café, as well as the Jerusalem branch of the German Protestant Institute of Archaeology. [3] Throughout much of its history, the compound was used first and foremost as a hospital, either by the military (during the First and Second World Wars and during Jordanian rule), or for Palestinian refugees and general public (from 1950 until today), and at times also as a government or military headquarters (1915–1927). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autotransplantation Autotransplantation is the transplantation of organs , tissues , or even particular proteins from one part of the body to another in the same person ( auto- meaning "self" in Greek [1] ). The autologous tissue (also called autogenous , autogeneic , or autogenic tissue) transplanted by such a procedure is called an autograft or autotransplant . [2] It is contrasted with allotransplantation (from other individual of the same species), Syngeneic transplantation (grafts transplanted between two genetically identical individuals of the same species) and xenotransplantation (from other species). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayurveda  Ayurveda ( / ˌ ɑː j ʊər ˈ v eɪ d ə , - ˈ v iː -/ ) [1] is an alternative medicine system with historical roots in the Indian subcontinent. [2] The theory and practice of Ayurveda is pseudoscientific . [3] [4] [5] The Indian Medical Association (IMA) characterises the practice of medicine by Ayurvedic practitioners as quackery . [6] Ayurveda is heavily practiced in India and Nepal, where around 80% of the population report using it. [7] [8] [9] [10] Ayurveda therapies have varied and evolved over more than two millennia. [2] Therapies include medicines, special diets, meditation, yoga, massage, laxatives, enemas, and medical oils. [11] [12] Medicines are typically based on complex herbal compounds, minerals, and metal substances (perhaps under the influence of early Indian alchemy or rasa shastra ). Ancient Ayurveda texts also taught surgical techniques, including rhinoplasty , kidney stone extractions , sutures, and the extraction of foreign objects. [13] [14] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azathioprine Azathioprine ( AZA ), sold under the brand name Imuran , among others, is an immunosuppressive medication . [2] It is used in rheumatoid arthritis , granulomatosis with polyangiitis , Crohn's disease , ulcerative colitis , and systemic lupus erythematosus , and in kidney transplants to prevent rejection . [2] [3] [4] [5] It is taken by mouth or injected into a vein . [2] Common side effects include bone-marrow suppression and vomiting . [2] Bone-marrow suppression is especially common in people with a genetic deficiency of the enzyme thiopurine S-methyltransferase . [2] Other serious risk factors include an increased risk of certain cancers . [2] Use during pregnancy may result in harm to the baby. [2] Azathioprine is in the purine analogue and antimetabolite family of medications. [2] [6] It works via 6-thioguanine to disrupt the making of RNA and DNA by cells. [2] [6] Azathioprine was first made in 1957. [6] It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines . [7] In 2017, it was the 335th-most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 800,000 prescriptions. [8] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacillus_Calmette-Gu%C3%A9rin  Bacillus Calmette–Guérin ( BCG ) vaccine is a vaccine primarily used against tuberculosis (TB). [4] It is named after its inventors Albert Calmette and Camille Guérin . [5] [6] In countries where TB or leprosy is common, one dose is recommended in healthy babies as soon after birth as possible. [4] In areas where TB is not common, only children at high risk are typically immunized, while suspected cases of TB are individually tested for and treated. [4] Adults who do not have TB and have not been previously immunized but are frequently exposed may be immunized as well. [4] BCG also has some effectiveness against Buruli ulcer infection and other nontuberculous mycobacteria infections. [4] Additionally it is sometimes used as part of the treatment of bladder cancer . [7] [8] Rates of protection against TB infection vary widely and protection lasts up to twenty years. [4] Among children it prevents about 20% from getting infected and among those who do get infected it protects half from developing disease. [9] The vaccine is given by injection into the skin. [4] There is no evidence that additional doses are beneficial. [4] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandage A bandage is a piece of material used either to support a medical device such as a dressing or splint , or on its own to provide support to or to restrict the movement of a part of the body. When used with a dressing, the dressing is applied directly on a wound, and a bandage used to hold the dressing in place.  Other bandages are used without dressings, such as elastic bandages that are used to reduce swelling or provide support to a sprained ankle.  Tight bandages can be used to slow blood flow to an extremity, such as when a leg or arm is bleeding heavily. Bandages are available in a wide range of types, from generic cloth strips to specialized shaped bandages designed for a specific limb or part of the body.  Bandages can often be improvised as the situation demands, using clothing, blankets or other material.  In American English , the word bandage is often used to indicate a small gauze dressing attached to an adhesive bandage . The most common type of bandage is the gauze bandage, a woven strip of material with a Telfa absorbent barrier to prevent adhering to wounds. A gauze bandage can come in any number of widths and lengths and can be used for almost any bandage application, including holding a dressing in place. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbiturate A barbiturate [a] is a drug that acts as a central nervous system depressant . Barbiturates are effective as anxiolytics , hypnotics , and anticonvulsants , but have physical and psychological addiction potential as well as overdose potential among other possible adverse effects. They have largely been replaced by benzodiazepines and nonbenzodiazepines ("Z-drugs") in routine medical practice, particularly in the treatment of anxiety and insomnia, due to the significantly lower risk of addiction and overdose and the lack of an antidote for barbiturate overdose. Despite this, barbiturates are still in use for various purposes: in general anesthesia , epilepsy , treatment of acute migraines or cluster headaches , acute tension headaches , euthanasia , capital punishment , and assisted suicide . [2] The name barbiturate originates from the fact that they are all chemical derivatives of barbituric acid . [3] Barbiturates such as phenobarbital were long used as anxiolytics and hypnotics . Intermediate-acting barbiturates reduce time to fall asleep, increase total sleep time, and reduce REM sleep time. Today they have been largely replaced by benzodiazepines for these purposes because the latter are less toxic in drug overdose . [4] [5] [6] However, barbiturates are still used as anticonvulsants (e.g., phenobarbital and primidone ) and general anesthetics (e.g., sodium thiopental ). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bat-borne_virus  Bat virome refers to the group of viruses associated with bats . Bats host a diverse array of viruses, including all seven types described by the Baltimore classification system : (I) double-stranded DNA viruses ; (II) single-stranded DNA viruses ; (III) double-stranded RNA viruses ; (IV) positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses ; (V) negative-sense single-stranded RNA viruses ; (VI) positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses that replicate through a DNA intermediate ; and (VII) double-stranded DNA viruses that replicate through a single-stranded RNA intermediate . The greatest share of bat-associated viruses identified as of 2020 are of type IV, in the family Coronaviridae . Bats harbor several viruses that are zoonotic , or capable of infecting humans, and some bat-borne viruses are considered important emerging viruses . [1] [2] These zoonotic viruses include the rabies virus , SARS-CoV , MERS-CoV , Marburg virus , Nipah virus , and Hendra virus . While research clearly indicates that SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats, [3] it is unknown how it was transmitted to humans, or if an intermediate host was involved. It has been speculated that bats may have a role in the ecology of the Ebola virus, though this is unconfirmed. While transmission of rabies from bats to humans usually occurs via biting, most other zoonotic bat viruses are transmitted by direct contact with infected bat fluids like urine, guano , or saliva, or through contact with an infected, non-bat intermediate host . There is no firm evidence that butchering or consuming bat meat can lead to viral transmission, though this has been speculated. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benadryl  Benadryl is a  brand of various antihistamine medications used to stop allergies , whose content varies in different countries, but which includes some or no combination of diphenhydramine , acrivastine , and cetirizine . It is sold by Johnson & Johnson . Benadryl is used to relieve allergy symptoms such as sneezing, itching, runny nose, rash , and hives . [1] Some forms of Benadryl are to be taken orally, while some creams and gels are to be applied to the skin. [2] Common side effects of the drug include drowsiness , dizziness , dry mouth and throat, confusion, and blurred vision . [2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benign Benignity (from Latin benignus "kind, good", itself deriving from bonus "good" and genus "origin") is any condition that is harmless in the long run. The opposite of benignity is malignity (or malignancy in medical discourse ). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_blocker  Beta blockers ( beta-blockers , β-blockers , etc.) are a class of medications that are predominantly used to manage abnormal heart rhythms , and to protect the heart from a second heart attack ( myocardial infarction ) after a first heart attack ( secondary prevention ). [1] They are also widely used to treat high blood pressure ( hypertension ), although they are no longer the first choice for initial treatment of most patients. [2] Beta blockers are competitive antagonists that block the receptor sites for the endogenous catecholamines epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine (noradrenaline) on adrenergic beta receptors , of the sympathetic nervous system , which mediates the fight-or-flight response . [3] [4] Some block activation of all types of β-adrenergic receptors and others are selective for one of the three known types of beta receptors, designated β 1 , β 2 and β 3 receptors. [5] β 1 -adrenergic receptors are located mainly in the heart and in the kidneys. [4] β 2 -adrenergic receptors are located mainly in the lungs, gastrointestinal tract, liver, uterus, vascular smooth muscle, and skeletal muscle. [4] β 3 -adrenergic receptors are located in fat cells. [6] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bevacizumab  Bevacizumab , sold under the brand name Avastin , is a medication used to treat a number of types of cancers and a specific eye disease . [6] [7] For cancer, it is given by slow injection into a vein ( intravenous ) and used for colon cancer , lung cancer , glioblastoma , and renal-cell carcinoma . In many of these diseases it is used as a first-line therapy [6] [7] For age-related macular degeneration it is given by injection into the eye ( intravitreal ). [6] Common side effects when used for cancer include nose bleeds , headache, high blood pressure, and rash. [6] Other severe side effects include gastrointestinal perforation , bleeding, allergic reactions , blood clots , and an increased risk of infection. [6] When used for eye disease side effects can include vision loss and retinal detachment . [6] Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody that functions as an angiogenesis inhibitor . [6] It works by slowing the growth of new blood vessels by inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), in other words anti–VEGF therapy . [6] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bibliomania Bibliomania can be a symptom of obsessive–compulsive disorder which involves the collecting or even hoarding of books to the point where social relations or health are damaged. Bibliomania is not to be confused with bibliophilia , which is the (psychologically healthy) love of books, and as such is not considered a clinical psychological disorder. One of several unusual behaviors associated with books, bibliomania is characterized by the collecting of books which have no use to the collector nor any great intrinsic value to a genuine book collector. The purchase of multiple copies of the same book and edition and the accumulation of books beyond possible capacity of use or enjoyment are frequent symptoms of bibliomania. [1] Bibliomania is not a psychological disorder recognized by the American Psychiatric Association in its DSM-IV. [2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binge_eating Binge eating is a pattern of disordered eating which consists of episodes of uncontrollable eating. It is a common symptom of eating disorders such as binge eating disorder and bulimia nervosa . During such binges, a person rapidly consumes an excessive quantity of food.  A diagnosis of binge eating is associated with feelings of loss of control. [1] Binge eating disorder is also linked with overweight and obesity. [2] The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, or rather the DSM, is a manual that is produced by the American Psychiatric Association (APA). In the DSM-5, which was released in 2013 by the APA, they included a disorder diagnosis criteria for Binge Eating Disorder (BED). It is as follows: [3] Typical warning signs of  binge eating disorder include the disappearance of large amount of foods in relatively short periods of time. A person who may be experiencing binge eating disorder may appear to be uncomfortable when eating around others or in public. [4] A person may develop new and extreme eating patterns that they have never done before. These might include diets that cut out certain food groups completely such as a no dairy or no carb diet. They might also steal or hoard food in unusual places. [4] A person may be experiencing fluctuations in their weight. In addition they may have feelings of disgust, depression, or guilt about over eating. [4] Another possible warning sign of binge eating is that a person may be obsessed with their body image or weight. [5] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy A biopsy is a medical test commonly performed by a surgeon , interventional radiologist , or an interventional cardiologist . The process involves extraction of sample cells or tissues for examination to determine the presence or extent of a disease. The tissue is generally examined under a microscope by a pathologist ; it may also be analyzed chemically. When an entire lump or suspicious area is removed, the procedure is called an excisional biopsy .  An incisional biopsy or core biopsy samples a portion of the abnormal tissue without attempting to remove the entire lesion or tumor. When a sample of tissue or fluid is removed with a needle in such a way that cells are removed without preserving the histological architecture of the tissue cells, the procedure is called a needle aspiration biopsy . Biopsies are most commonly performed for insight into possible cancerous or inflammatory conditions. The Arab physician Abulcasis (1013–1107) developed one of the earliest diagnostic biopsies. He used a needle  to puncture a goiter and then characterized the material. [1] [ verification needed ] The term biopsy reflects the Greek words βίος bios , "life," and ὄψις opsis , "a sight." [2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biricodar Biricodar or incel ( INN , codename VX-710 ) was a pharmaceutical drug under development by Vertex Pharmaceuticals to help treat ovarian cancer patients, that never reached the market.  This antineoplastic or immunomodulatory drug article is a stub . You can help Wikipedia by expanding it . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_defect A birth defect , also known as a congenital disorder , is a condition present at birth regardless of its cause. [3] Birth defects may result in disabilities that may be physical , intellectual , or developmental . [3] The disabilities can range from mild to severe. [7] Birth defects are divided into two main types: structural disorders in which problems are seen with the shape of a body part and functional disorders in which problems exist with how a body part works. [4] Functional disorders include metabolic and degenerative disorders . [4] Some birth defects include both structural and functional disorders. [4] Birth defects may result from genetic or chromosomal disorders , exposure to certain medications or chemicals, or certain infections during pregnancy . [5] Risk factors include folate deficiency , drinking alcohol or smoking during pregnancy, poorly controlled diabetes , and a mother over the age of 35 years old. [6] [7] Many are believed to involve multiple factors. [7] Birth defects may be visible at birth or diagnosed by screening tests . [10] A number of defects can be detected before birth by different prenatal tests . [10] Treatment varies depending on the defect in question. [8] This may include therapy , medication, surgery, or assistive technology . [8] Birth defects affected about 96 million people as of 2015. [11] In the United States, they occur in about 3% of newborns. [2] They resulted in about 628,000 deaths in 2015, down from 751,000 in 1990. [12] [9] The types with the greatest numbers of deaths are congenital heart disease (303,000), followed by neural tube defects (65,000). [9] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_donation A blood donation occurs when a person voluntarily has blood drawn and used for transfusions and/or made into biopharmaceutical medications by a process called fractionation (separation of whole blood components). Donation may be of whole blood, or of specific components directly ( apheresis ). Blood banks often participate in the collection process as well as the procedures that follow it. Today in the developed world , most blood donors are unpaid volunteers who donate blood for a community supply. In some countries, established supplies are limited and donors usually give blood when family or friends need a transfusion (directed donation).  Many donors donate for several reasons, such as a form of charity, general awareness regarding the demand for blood, increased confidence in oneself, helping a personal friend or relative, and social pressure.  Despite the many reasons that people donate, not enough potential donors actively donate.  However, this is reversed during disasters when blood donations increase, often creating an excess supply that will have to be later discarded.  However, in countries that allow paid donation some people are paid, and in some cases there are incentives other than money such as paid time off from work. People can also have blood drawn for their own future use ( autologous donation ). Donating is relatively safe, but some donors have bruising where the needle is inserted or may feel faint. Potential donors are evaluated for anything that might make their blood unsafe to use. The screening includes testing for diseases that can be transmitted by a blood transfusion, including HIV and viral hepatitis . The donor must also answer questions about medical history and take a short physical examination to make sure the donation is not hazardous to his or her health. How often a donor can donate varies from days to months based on what component they donate and the laws of the country where the donation takes place. For example, in the United States, donors must wait 56 days (eight weeks) between whole-blood donations but only seven days between platelet apheresis donations [1] and twice per seven-day period in plasmapheresis . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_doping Blood doping is the practice of boosting the number of red blood cells in the bloodstream in order to enhance athletic performance. Because such blood cells carry oxygen from the lungs to the muscles , a higher concentration in the blood can improve an athlete's aerobic capacity (VO 2 max) and endurance . [1] Blood doping can be achieved by making the body produce more red blood cells itself using drugs, giving blood transfusions either from another person or back to the same individual, or by using blood substitutes. Many methods of blood doping are illegal, particularly in professional sports where it is considered to give an artificial advantage to the competitor. Anti-doping agencies use tests to try to identify individuals who have been blood doping using a number of methods, typically by analysing blood samples from the competitors. Blood doping is defined as the use of illicit products (e.g. erythropoietin (EPO), darbepoetin-alfa, hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) stabilizers) and methods (e.g. increase aerobic capacity by maximizing the uptake of O 2 ) in order to enhance the O 2 transport of the body to the muscles. [2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_draw In medicine, venipuncture or venepuncture is the process of obtaining intravenous access for the purpose of venous blood sampling (also called phlebotomy ) or intravenous therapy . In healthcare, this procedure is performed by medical laboratory scientists , medical practitioners , some EMTs , paramedics , phlebotomists , dialysis technicians, and other nursing staff. [1] In veterinary medicine , the procedure is performed by veterinarians and veterinary technicians . It is essential to follow a standard procedure for the collection of blood specimens to get accurate laboratory results. Any error in collecting the blood or filling the test tubes may lead to erroneous laboratory results. [2] Venipuncture is one of the most routinely performed invasive procedures and is carried out for any of five reasons: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_film A blood film —or peripheral blood smear —is a thin layer of blood smeared on a glass microscope slide and then stained in such a way as to allow the various blood cells to be examined microscopically. Blood films are examined in the investigation of hematological (blood) disorders and  are routinely employed to look for blood parasites , such as those of malaria and filariasis . Blood films are made by placing a drop of blood on one end of a slide, and using a spreader slide to disperse the blood over the slide's length. The aim is to get a region, called a monolayer, where the cells are spaced far enough apart to be counted and differentiated. The monolayer is found in the "feathered edge" created by the spreader slide as it draws the blood forward. The slide is left to air dry, after which the blood is fixed to the slide by immersing it briefly in methanol . The fixative is essential for good staining and presentation of cellular detail. After fixation, the slide is stained to distinguish the cells from each other. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test A blood test is a laboratory analysis performed on a blood sample that is usually extracted from a vein in the arm using a hypodermic needle , or via fingerprick . Multiple tests for specific blood components, such as a glucose test or a cholesterol test , are often grouped together into one test panel called a blood panel or blood work . Blood tests are often used in health care to determine physiological and biochemical states, such as disease , mineral content, pharmaceutical drug effectiveness, and organ function. Typical clinical blood panels include a basic metabolic panel or a complete blood count . Blood tests are also used in drug tests to detect drug abuse. A venipuncture is useful as it is a minimally invasive way to obtain cells and extracellular fluid ( plasma ) from the body for analysis. Blood flows throughout the body, acting as a medium that provides oxygen and nutrients to tissues and carries waste products back to the excretory systems for disposal. Consequently, the state of the bloodstream affects or is affected by, many medical conditions. For these reasons, blood tests are the most commonly performed medical tests . [1] If only a few drops of blood are needed, a fingerstick is performed instead of a venipuncture . [2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_transfusion Blood transfusion is the process of transferring blood products into one's circulation intravenously . [1] Transfusions are used for various medical conditions to replace lost components of the blood. Early transfusions used whole blood , but modern medical practice commonly uses only components of the blood, such as red blood cells , white blood cells , plasma , clotting factors , and platelets . Red blood cells (RBC) contain hemoglobin , and supply the cells of the body with oxygen . White blood cells are not commonly used during transfusion, but are part of the immune system, and fight infections. Plasma is the "yellowish" liquid part of blood, which acts as a buffer, and contains proteins and important substances needed for the body's overall health. Platelets are involved in blood clotting, preventing the body from bleeding. Before these components were known, doctors believed that blood was homogenous. Because of this, many patients died because incompatible blood was transferred to them. Historically, red blood cell transfusion was considered when the hemoglobin level fell below 10 g/dL or hematocrit fell below 30%. [2] [3] Because each unit of blood given carries risks, a trigger level lower than that, at 7 to 8 g/dL, is now usually used, as it has been shown to have better patient outcomes. [4] [5] The administration of a single unit of blood is the standard for hospitalized people who are not bleeding, with this treatment followed with re-assessment and consideration of symptoms and hemoglobin concentration. [4] Patients with poor oxygen saturation may need more blood. [4] The advisory caution to use blood transfusion only with more severe anemia is in part due to evidence that outcomes are worsened if larger amounts are given. [6] One may consider transfusion for people with symptoms of cardiovascular disease such as chest pain or shortness of breath. [3] In cases where patients have low levels of hemoglobin due to iron deficiency, but are cardiovascularly stable, parenteral iron is a preferred option based on both efficacy and safety. [7] Other blood products are given where appropriate, e.g., to treat clotting deficiencies. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloodletting Bloodletting (or blood-letting ) is the withdrawal of blood from a patient to prevent or cure illness and disease.  Bloodletting, whether by a physician or by leeches , was based on an ancient system of medicine in which blood and other bodily fluids were regarded as " humours " that had to remain in proper balance to maintain health. It is claimed to have been the most common medical practice performed by surgeons from antiquity until the late 19th century, a span of over 2,000 years. [1] In Europe, the practice continued to be relatively common until the end of the 18th century. [2] The practice has now been abandoned by modern-style medicine for all except a few very specific medical conditions . [3] It is conceivable that historically, in the absence of other treatments for hypertension , bloodletting sometimes had a beneficial effect in temporarily reducing blood pressure by reducing blood volume. [4] However, since hypertension is very often asymptomatic and thus not diagnosable without modern methods, this effect was unintentional.  In the overwhelming majority of cases, the historical use of bloodletting was harmful to patients. [5] Today, the term phlebotomy refers to the drawing of blood for laboratory analysis or blood transfusion . [6] Therapeutic phlebotomy refers to the drawing of a unit of blood in specific cases like hemochromatosis , polycythemia vera , porphyria cutanea tarda , etc., to reduce the number of red blood cells. [7] [8] The traditional medical practice of bloodletting is today considered to be a pseudoscience . [9] Passages from the Ebers  Papyrus may indicate that bloodletting by scarification  was an accepted practice in Ancient Egypt . [10] [11] [12] Egyptian burials have been reported to contain bloodletting instruments. [13] According to some accounts, the Egyptians based the idea on their observations of the hippopotamus , [14] confusing its red secretions with blood and believing that it scratched itself to relieve distress. [15] [16] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow_failure Bone marrow failure occurs in individuals who produce an insufficient amount of red blood cells , white blood cells or platelets . Red blood cells transport oxygen to be distributed throughout the body’s tissue. White blood cells fight off infections that enter the body. Bone marrow also contains platelets , which trigger clotting , and thus help stop the blood flow when a wound occurs. [1] Bone marrow failure is associated with three types of diseases, Fanconi anemia (FA), dyskeratosis congenita , and aplastic anemia . Fanconi anemia is an inherited blood disorder due to abnormal breakages in DNA genes. It is linked to hyperpigmentation, which is the darkening of an area of skin or nails caused by increased melanin. According to Histopathology, “However, in about 30% of FA patients no physical abnormalities are found”. [2] Dyskeratosis congenita often affects multiple parts of the body. Individuals with this disorder usually show changes in skin pigmentations, unusual fingernail growth, and mucosa leukoplakia; the inner part of the mouth is encased with white patches that may never resolve. [2] Aplastic anemia happens when bone marrow doesn’t produce enough new blood cells throughout the body. Aplastic anemia is an acquired autoimmune disease, which occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys healthy body tissue. [3] Bone marrow failure in both children and adults can be either inherited or acquired. Inherited bone marrow failure is often the cause in young children, while older children and adults may acquire the disease later in life. [4] A maturation defect in genes is a common cause of inherited bone marrow failure. [5] The most common cause of acquired bone marrow failure is aplastic anemia. [5] Working with chemicals such as benzene could be a factor in causing the illness. Other factors include radiation or chemotherapy treatments, and immune system problems. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_metastasis Bone metastases , or osseous metastatic disease, is a category of cancer metastases that results from primary tumor invasion to bone .  Bone-originating primary tumors such as osteosarcoma , chondrosarcoma , and Ewing's sarcoma are rare. [1] Unlike hematological malignancies that originate in the blood and form non-solid tumors, bone metastases generally arise from epithelial tumors and form a solid mass inside the bone.  Bone metastases cause severe pain, characterized by a dull, constant ache with periodic spikes of incident pain . [2] Under normal conditions, bone undergoes a continuous remodeling through osteoclast -mediated bone resorption and osteoblast -mediated bone deposition. [3] These processes are normally tightly regulated within bone to maintain bone structure and calcium homeostasis in the body.  Disregulation of these processes by tumor cells leads to either osteoblastic or osteolytic lesions, reflective of the underlying mechanism of development. [3] Typically, osteolytic metastases are more aggressive than osteoblastic metastases, which have a slower course.  Regardless of the phenotype, though, bone metastases show osteoclast proliferation and hypertrophy . [4] Primary tumors https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowel_obstruction  Bowel obstruction , also known as intestinal obstruction , is a mechanical or functional obstruction of the intestines which prevents the normal movement of the products of digestion . [2] [5] Either the small bowel or large bowel may be affected. [1] Signs and symptoms include abdominal pain , vomiting , bloating and not passing gas . [1] Mechanical obstruction is the cause of about 5 to 15% of cases of severe abdominal pain of sudden onset requiring admission to hospital. [1] [2] Causes of bowel obstruction include adhesions , hernias , volvulus , endometriosis , inflammatory bowel disease , appendicitis , tumors , diverticulitis , ischemic bowel , tuberculosis and intussusception . [1] [2] Small bowel obstructions are most often due to adhesions and hernias while large bowel obstructions are most often due to tumors and volvulus. [1] [2] The diagnosis may be made on plain X-rays ; however, CT scan is more accurate. [1] Ultrasound or MRI may help in the diagnosis of children or pregnant women. [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_augmentation Breast augmentation and augmentation mammoplasty ( colloquially : " boob job ") is a cosmetic surgery technique using breast-implants and fat-graft mammoplasty techniques to increase the size, change the shape, and alter the texture of the breasts of a woman. Augmentation mammoplasty is applied to correct congenital defects of the breasts and the chest wall. [ citation needed ] As an elective cosmetic surgery, primary augmentation changes the aesthetics – of size, shape, and texture – of healthy breasts. [ citation needed ] The surgical implantation approach creates a spherical augmentation of the breast hemisphere, using a breast implant filled with either saline solution or silicone gel ; the fat-graft transfer approach augments the size and corrects contour defects of the breast hemisphere with grafts of the adipocyte fat tissue , drawn from the person's body. In a breast reconstruction procedure, a tissue expander (a temporary breast implant device) is sometimes put in place and inflated with saline to prepare (shape and enlarge) the recipient site (implant pocket) to receive and accommodate the breast implant prosthesis. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_reduction Reduction mammoplasty (also breast reduction and reduction mammaplasty ) is the plastic surgery procedure for reducing the size of large breasts. In a breast reduction surgery for re-establishing a functional bust that is proportionate to the woman's body, the critical corrective consideration is the tissue viability of the nipple–areola complex (NAC), to ensure the functional sensitivity and lactational capability of the breasts. The indications for breast reduction surgery are three-fold – physical, aesthetic , and psychological – the restoration of the bust, of the woman's self-image , and of her mental health . [1] In corrective practice, the surgical techniques and praxis for reduction mammoplasty also are applied to mastopexy (breast lift). [2] [3] The woman afflicted with macromastia presents heavy, enlarged breasts that sag and cause her chronic pains to the head, neck, shoulders, and back; an oversized bust also causes her secondary health problems, such as poor blood circulation , impaired breathing (inability to fill the lungs with air); chafing of the skin of the chest and the lower breast (inframammary intertrigo); brassière-strap indentations to the shoulders; and the improper fit of clothes. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol_stool_scale  The Bristol stool scale is a diagnostic medical tool designed to classify the form of human faeces into seven categories. It is used in both clinical and experimental fields. [3] [4] [5] It was developed at the Bristol Royal Infirmary as a clinical assessment tool in 1997, and is widely used as a research tool to evaluate the effectiveness of treatments for various diseases of the bowel, as well as a clinical communication aid; [6] [7] including being part of the diagnostic triad for irritable bowel syndrome . [8] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Medical_Journal  The BMJ is a weekly peer-reviewed medical trade journal , published by the trade union the British Medical Association (BMA). The BMJ has editorial freedom from the BMA. [1] It is one of the world's oldest general medical journals. Originally called the British Medical Journal , the title was officially shortened to BMJ in 1988, and then changed to The BMJ in 2014. [2] The journal is published by BMJ Publishing Group Ltd , a subsidiary of the British Medical Association (BMA). The editor-in-chief of The BMJ is Fiona Godlee , who was appointed in February 2005. [3] The journal began publishing on 3 October 1840 as the Provincial Medical and Surgical Journal and quickly attracted the attention of physicians around the world through its publication of high-impact original research articles and unique case reports. [4] The BMJ' s first editors were P. Hennis Green , lecturer on the diseases of children at the Hunterian School of Medicine , who also was its founder and Robert Streeten of Worcester , a member of the Provincial Medical and Surgical Association council. [ citation needed ] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bupropion  Bupropion , sold under the brand names Wellbutrin and Zyban among others, is an atypical antidepressant primarily used to treat major depressive disorder and to support smoking cessation . [6] [7] Bupropion is an effective antidepressant on its own, but it is also popular as an add-on medication in the cases of incomplete response to the first-line selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant. [7] [8] Bupropion has several features that distinguish it from other antidepressants: it does not usually cause sexual dysfunction; [7] it is not associated with weight gain [7] and sleepiness , [9] and it is more effective than SSRIs at improving symptoms of hypersomnia and fatigue. [10] Common adverse effects of bupropion with the greatest difference from placebo are dry mouth, nausea, constipation, insomnia, anxiety, tremor, and excessive sweating. [11] Raised blood pressure is notable. [12] Rare but serious side effects include seizure , [11] liver toxicity , [13] psychosis , [14] and risk of overdose. [15] Bupropion use during pregnancy may be associated with increased odds of congenital heart defects . [16] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bypass_(surgical) Bypass surgery refers to a class of surgeries involving rerouting a tubular body part. [1] Types include:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cancer_Council_Australia  Cancer Council Australia is a national, NFP organisation which aims to promote cancer -control policies and to reduce the illness caused by cancer in Australia . It advises various groups, including the government, on cancer-related issues, acts as an advocate for cancer patients and their friends, and is a major funding contributor towards health research , prevention and education . Cancer Council Australia formed in 1961 as the Australian Cancer Society. [1] It was renamed Cancer Council Australia in 1997 and appointed Alan Coates its inaugural CEO. [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_of_unknown_primary_origin Cancer of unknown primary origin ( CUP ) is a cancer that is determined to be at the metastatic stage at the time of diagnosis, but a primary tumor cannot be identified. A diagnosis of CUP requires a clinical picture consistent with metastatic disease and one or more biopsy results inconsistent with a tumor cancer CUP is found in about 3 to 5% of all people diagnosed with invasive cancer, [1] and carries a poor prognosis in most (80 to 85%) of those circumstances.  The other 15 to 20% of patients, however, have a relatively long survival with appropriate treatment. [1] Most cancers typically present as a single primary tumor .  Over the course of time—particularly if the primary tumor is left untreated—smaller "satellite" tumors will appear at other places in the body, a phenomenon known as metastasis .  Less commonly, a metastatic tumor is found first; but in most such cases, the primary tumor can then be located via examination and testing.  Rarely (3-5% of the time), the primary tumor cannot be found because it is too small, or because it has regressed due to immune system activity or other factors. In such situations a diagnosis of cancer of unknown primary origin (CUP) is made. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_drug_testing Cannabis drug testing describes various drug test methodologies for the use of cannabis in medicine, sport, and law. Cannabis use is highly detectable and can be detected by urinalysis , hair analysis , as well as saliva tests for days or weeks. Unlike alcohol, for which impairment can be reasonably measured using a breathalyser (and confirmed with a blood alcohol content measurement), valid detection for cannabis is time-consuming, and tests cannot determine an approximate degree of impairment. The lack of suitable tests and agreed-upon intoxication levels is an issue in the legality of cannabis , especially regarding intoxicated driving . The concentrations obtained from such analyses can often be helpful in distinguishing active use from passive exposure, elapsed time since use, and extent or duration of use. Although between 2000-2020 there had been a recall for 80% of at home drug testing kits. Because of this many companies took action and the industries identified the contents of these products which led them to take efforts of identifying the problem by finding a solution involving the chemical immunoassay. This was the main cause of why drug tests were so unreliable for the time being. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiology Cardiology (from Greek καρδίᾱ kardiā , "heart" and -λογία -logia , "study") is a branch of medicine that deals with the disorders of the heart as well as some parts of the circulatory system . The field includes medical diagnosis and treatment of congenital heart defects , coronary artery disease , heart failure , valvular heart disease and electrophysiology . Physicians who specialize in this field of medicine are called cardiologists , a specialty of internal medicine . Pediatric cardiologists are pediatricians who specialize in cardiology. Physicians who specialize in cardiac surgery are called cardiothoracic surgeons or cardiac surgeons , a specialty of general surgery . All cardiologists study the disorders of the heart, but the study of adult and child heart disorders are through different training pathways. Therefore, an adult cardiologist (often simply called "cardiologist") is inadequately trained to take care of children, and pediatric cardiologists are not trained to take care of adult heart disease. The surgical aspects are not included in cardiology and are in the domain of cardiothoracic surgery . For example, coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG), cardiopulmonary bypass and valve replacement are surgical procedures performed by surgeons, not cardiologists. However, the insertion of stents and pacemakers is performed by cardiologists. [ citation needed ] Cardiology is a specialty of internal medicine . To be a cardiologist in the United States , a three-year residency in internal medicine is followed by a three-year fellowship in cardiology. It is possible to specialize further in a sub-specialty. Recognized sub-specialties in the United States by the ACGME are cardiac electrophysiology , echocardiography , interventional cardiology , and nuclear cardiology . Recognized subspecialties in the United States by the American Osteopathic Association Bureau of Osteopathic Specialists (AOABOS) include clinical cardiac electrophysiology and interventional cardiology . [1] [2] While in India, a person needs to undergo three years of residency in General Medicine or Pediatrics after M.B.B.S and then three years of residency in Cardiology to be a D.M/ Diplomate of National Board (DNB) in Cardiology. [ citation needed ] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease  Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) is a class of diseases that involve the heart or blood vessels . [2] CVD includes coronary artery diseases (CAD) such as angina and myocardial infarction (commonly known as a heart attack). [2] Other CVDs include stroke , heart failure , hypertensive heart disease , rheumatic heart disease , cardiomyopathy , abnormal heart rhythms , congenital heart disease , valvular heart disease , carditis , aortic aneurysms , peripheral artery disease , thromboembolic disease , and venous thrombosis . [2] [3] The underlying mechanisms vary depending on the disease. [2] Coronary artery disease, stroke, and peripheral artery disease involve atherosclerosis . [2] This may be caused by high blood pressure , smoking , diabetes mellitus , lack of exercise , obesity , high blood cholesterol , poor diet, and excessive alcohol consumption, among others. [2] High blood pressure is estimated to account for approximately 13% of CVD deaths, while tobacco accounts for 9%, diabetes 6%, lack of exercise 6% and obesity 5%. [2] Rheumatic heart disease may follow untreated strep throat . [2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cefalexin Cefalexin , also spelled cephalexin , is an antibiotic that can treat a number of bacterial infections . [4] It kills gram-positive and some gram-negative bacteria by disrupting the growth of the bacterial cell wall. [4] Cefalexin is a beta-lactam antibiotic within the class of first-generation cephalosporins . [4] It works similarly to other agents within this class, including intravenous cefazolin , but can be taken by mouth. [5] Cefalexin can treat certain bacterial infections, including those of the middle ear , bone and joint , skin , and urinary tract . [4] It may also be used for certain types of pneumonia , strep throat , and to prevent bacterial endocarditis . [4] Cefalexin is not effective against infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), most Enterococcus , or Pseudomonas . [4] Like other antibiotics, cefalexin cannot treat viral infections , such as the flu , common cold or acute bronchitis . [4] Cefalexin can be used in those who have mild or moderate allergies to penicillin . [4] However, it is not recommended in those with severe penicillin allergies. [4] Common side effects include stomach upset and diarrhea . [4] Allergic reactions or infections with Clostridium difficile , a cause of diarrhea, are also possible. [4] Use during pregnancy or breast feeding does not appear to be harmful to the baby. [4] [6] [7] It can be used in children and those over 65 years of age. [4] Those with kidney problems may require a decrease in dose. [4] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_nervous_system_disease Central nervous system diseases , also known as central nervous system disorders , are a group of neurological disorders that affect the structure or function of the brain or spinal cord , which collectively form the central nervous system (CNS). [1] [2] [3] Every disease has different signs and symptoms . Some of them are persistent headache; pain in the face, back, arms, or legs; an inability to concentrate; loss of feeling; memory loss; loss of muscle strength; tremors ; seizures; increased reflexes, spasticity, tics; paralysis; and slurred speech . One should seek medical attention if affected by these. Any type of traumatic brain injury (TBI) or injury done to the spinal cord can result in a wide spectrum of disabilities in a person. Depending on the section of the brain or spinal cord that suffers the trauma, the outcome may be anticipated. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_venous_catheter   A central venous catheter ( CVC ), also known as a central line , central venous line, or central venous access catheter , is a catheter placed into a large vein . It is a form of venous access . Placement of larger catheters in more centrally located veins is often needed in critically ill patients, or in those requiring prolonged intravenous therapies, for more reliable vascular access. These catheters are commonly placed in veins in the neck ( internal jugular vein ), chest ( subclavian vein or axillary vein ), groin ( femoral vein ), or through veins in the arms (also known as a PICC line , or peripherally inserted central catheters). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poissy-Saint-Germain-en-Laye_Hospital https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_amyloid_angiopathy Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), is a form of angiopathy in which amyloid beta peptide deposits in the walls of small to medium blood vessels of the central nervous system and meninges . [2] [3] The term congophilic is sometimes used because the presence of the abnormal aggregations of amyloid can be demonstrated by microscopic examination of brain tissue after staining with Congo red . The amyloid material is only found in the brain and as such the disease is not related to other forms of amyloidosis . [4] CAA is associated with brain hemorrhages, particularly microhemorrhages. Since CAA can be caused by the same amyloid protein that is associated with Alzheimer's dementia, brain bleeds [5] are more common in people who have a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. However, they can also occur in those who have no history of dementia .  The bleeding within the brain is usually confined to a particular lobe [6] and this is slightly different compared to brain bleeds which occur as a consequence of high blood pressure ( hypertension ) - a more common cause of a hemorrhagic stroke (or bleeding in the brain ). [7] CAA has been identified as occurring either sporadically (generally in elderly populations) [8] or in familial forms such as Flemish, Iowa, and Dutch types. In all cases, it is defined by the deposition of amyloid beta (Aβ) in the leptomeningal and cerebral vessel walls. [9] CAA occurring in the Flemish type has been observed to be linked to large dense-core plaques observed in this pedigree. [10] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_arteriovenous_malformation A cerebral arteriovenous malformation ( cerebral AVM , CAVM , cAVM ) is an abnormal connection between the arteries and veins in the brain —specifically, an arteriovenous malformation in the cerebrum . The most frequently observed problems, related to an AVM, are headaches and seizures , cranial nerve deficits, [1] backaches, neckaches and eventual nausea, as the coagulated blood makes its way down to be dissolved in the individual's spinal fluid. It is supposed that 15% of the population, at detection, have no symptoms at all. [2] Other common symptoms are a pulsing noise in the head, progressive weakness and numbness and vision changes as well as debilitating, excruciating pain. [3] [4] In serious cases, the blood vessels rupture and there is bleeding within the brain ( intracranial hemorrhage ). Nevertheless, in more than half of patients with AVM, hemorrhage is the first symptom. [5] Symptoms due to bleeding include loss of consciousness, sudden and severe headache, nausea, vomiting, incontinence , and blurred vision, amongst others. [3] Impairments caused by local brain tissue damage on the bleed site are also possible, including seizure, one-sided weakness ( hemiparesis ), a loss of touch sensation on one side of the body and deficits in language processing ( aphasia ). [3] Ruptured AVMs are responsible for considerable mortality and morbidity. [6] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_infarction A cerebral infarction is an area of necrotic tissue in the brain . It results from a blockage or narrowing in the arteries supplying blood and oxygen to the brain. The restricted oxygen due to the restricted blood supply causes an ischemic stroke , which can result in an infarction if the blood flow is not restored within a relatively short period of time. The blockage can be due to a thrombus , an embolus , or an atheromatous stenosis of one or more arteries . [1] Which arteries are problematic will determine which areas of the brain are affected (infarcted). These varying infarcts will produce different symptoms and outcomes. About one third will prove fatal. There are various classification systems [2] for a cerebral infarction, some of which are described below. Symptoms of cerebral infarction are determined by the parts of the brain affected. If the infarct is located in the primary motor cortex , contralateral hemiparesis is said to occur. With brainstem localization, brainstem syndromes are typical: Wallenberg's syndrome , Weber's syndrome , Millard–Gubler syndrome , Benedikt syndrome or others. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrovascular_disease Cerebrovascular disease includes a variety of medical conditions that affect the blood vessels of the brain and the cerebral circulation . Arteries supplying oxygen and nutrients to the brain are often damaged or deformed in these disorders. [2] The most common presentation of cerebrovascular disease is an ischemic stroke or mini-stroke and sometimes a hemorrhagic stroke . [2] Hypertension (high blood pressure) is the most important contributing risk factor for stroke and cerebrovascular diseases as it can change the structure of blood vessels and result in atherosclerosis . [5] Atherosclerosis narrows blood vessels in the brain, resulting in decreased cerebral perfusion. Other risk factors that contribute to stroke include smoking and diabetes. [6] Narrowed cerebral arteries can lead to ischemic stroke , but continually elevated blood pressure can also cause tearing of vessels, leading to a hemorrhagic stroke. [4] A stroke usually presents with an abrupt onset of a neurologic deficit – such as hemiplegia (one-sided weakness), numbness, aphasia (language impairment), or ataxia (loss of coordination) – attributable to a focal vascular lesion. [7] The neurologic symptoms manifest within seconds because neurons need a continual supply of nutrients, including glucose and oxygen, that are provided by the blood. Therefore if blood supply to the brain is impeded, injury and energy failure is rapid. [8] Besides hypertension, there are also many less common causes of cerebrovascular disease, including those that are congenital or idiopathic and include CADASIL , aneurysms , amyloid angiopathy , arteriovenous malformations , fistulas , and arterial dissections . [9] Many of these diseases can be asymptomatic until an acute event, such as a stroke, occurs. [9] Cerebrovascular diseases can also present less commonly with headache or seizures. [10] Any of these diseases can result in vascular dementia due to ischemic damage to the brain. [11] [12] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cesarean_section  Caesarean section , also known as C-section , or caesarean delivery , is the surgical procedure by which one or more babies are delivered through an incision in the mother's abdomen, often performed because vaginal delivery would put the baby or mother at risk. [2] Various Human groups have been attempting and actively doing the caesarean section for 100s to 1000s of years.(note: The earliest group known to practice this operation are the Bunyoro people from northern Uganda who scholars believe have been practicing the operation since their ancient times).Reasons for the operation include obstructed labor , twin pregnancy , high blood pressure in the mother, breech birth , and problems with the placenta or umbilical cord . [2] [3] A caesarean delivery may be performed based upon the shape of the mother's pelvis or history of a previous C-section. [2] [3] A trial of vaginal birth after C-section may be possible. [2] The World Health Organization recommends that caesarean section be performed only when medically necessary. [3] [4] Some C-sections are performed without a medical reason, upon request by someone, usually the mother. [2] A C-section typically takes 45 minutes to an hour. [2] It may be done with a spinal block , where the woman is awake, or under general anesthesia . [2] A urinary catheter is used to drain the bladder , and the skin of the abdomen is then cleaned with an antiseptic . [2] An incision of about 15 cm (6 inches) is then typically made through the mother's lower abdomen. [2] The uterus is then opened with a second incision and the baby delivered. [2] The incisions are then stitched closed. [2] A woman can typically begin breastfeeding as soon as she is out of the operating room and awake. [5] Often, several days are required in the hospital to recover sufficiently to return home. [2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_burn A chemical burn occurs when living tissue is exposed to a corrosive substance (such as a strong acid , base or oxidizer ) or a cytotoxic agent (such as mustard gas , lewisite or arsine ). Chemical burns follow standard burn classification and may cause extensive tissue damage. The main types of irritant and/or corrosive products are: acids, bases, oxidizers / reducing agents, solvents , and alkylants. Additionally, chemical burns can be caused by some types of cytotoxic chemical weapons , e.g., vesicants such as mustard gas and Lewisite , or urticants such as phosgene oxime . Chemical burns may: The exact symptoms of a chemical burn depend on the chemical involved. Symptoms include itching, bleaching or darkening of skin, burning sensations, trouble breathing , coughing blood and/or tissue necrosis . Common sources of chemical burns include sulfuric acid (H 2 SO 4 ), hydrochloric acid (HCl) , sodium hydroxide ( Na OH ), lime (CaO), silver nitrate ( Ag NO 3 ), and hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ).  Effects depend on the substance; hydrogen peroxide removes a bleached layer of skin, while nitric acid causes a characteristic color change to yellow in the skin, and silver nitrate produces noticeable black stains.  Chemical burns may occur through direct contact on body surfaces, including skin and eyes, via inhalation, and/or by ingestion. Lipophilic substances that diffuse efficiently in human tissue, e.g., hydrofluoric acid , sulfur mustard , and dimethyl sulfate , may not react immediately, but instead produce the burns and inflammation hours after the contact. Chemical fabrication , mining , medicine , and related professional fields are examples of occupations where chemical burns may occur.  Hydrofluoric acid leaches into the bloodstream, reacts with calcium and magnesium, and the resulting salts can cause cardiac arrest after eating through skin. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiropractic  Chiropractic is a pseudoscientific [1] alternative medicine [2] that is concerned with the diagnosis and treatment of mechanical disorders of the musculoskeletal system , especially the spine . [3] Chiropractors, especially those in the field's early history, have proposed that such disorders affect general health via the nervous system . [3] The main chiropractic treatment technique involves manual therapy , especially manipulation of the spine , other joints, and soft tissues , but may also include exercises and health and lifestyle counseling. [4] A chiropractor may have a Doctor of Chiropractic (D.C.) degree and be referred to as a doctor, and in some jurisdictions can be called a chiropractic physician , but is not a Doctor of Medicine . [5] [6] Systematic reviews of controlled clinical studies of treatments used by chiropractors have not found evidence that chiropractic manipulation is effective , with the possible exception of treatment for back pain . [7] A critical evaluation found that collectively, spinal manipulation was ineffective at treating any condition. [8] Spinal manipulation may be cost-effective for sub-acute or chronic low back pain but the results for acute low back pain were insufficient. [9] The efficacy and cost-effectiveness of maintenance chiropractic care are unknown. [10] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorpromazine  Chlorpromazine ( CPZ ), marketed under the brand names Thorazine and Largactil among others, is an antipsychotic medication. [4] It is primarily used to treat psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia . [4] Other uses include the treatment of bipolar disorder , severe behavioral problems in children including those with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder , nausea and vomiting , anxiety before surgery, and hiccups that do not improve following other measures. [4] It can be given by mouth , by injection into a muscle , or into a vein . [4] Chlorpromazine is in the typical antipsychotic class, [4] and, chemically, is one of the phenothiazines . Its mechanism of action is not entirely clear but believed to be related to its ability as a dopamine antagonist . [4] It also has anti-serotonergic and antihistaminergic properties. [4] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choking_game The Choking game refers to intentionally cutting off oxygen to the brain with the goal of inducing temporary loss of consciousness and euphoria . Limited research has been conducted regarding motivations for practicing the fainting game, although thrill-seeking has been identified as a risk factor, [1] as has the perception that it is a low-risk activity. [2] Anecdotal reasons stated include: Reasons for practice are distinct from erotic asphyxiation . Steve Field, chairman of the Royal College of General Practitioners in London, [4] claims that the fainting game is pursued primarily by children and teens "to get a high without taking drugs." Children "aren't playing this game for sexual gratification." It is frequently confused with erotic asphyxiation, which is oxygen deprivation for sexual arousal. Unlike erotic asphyxiation , practice of the fainting game appears to be uncommon in adulthood. [5] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chordoma Chordoma is a rare slow-growing neoplasm thought to arise from cellular remnants of the notochord . The evidence for this is the location of the tumors (along the neuraxis ), the similar immunohistochemical staining patterns, and the demonstration that notochordal cells are preferentially left behind in the clivus and sacrococcygeal regions when the remainder of the notochord regresses during fetal life. In layman's terms, chordoma is a type of spinal cancer. [1] Chordomas can arise from bone in the skull base and anywhere along the spine. The two most common locations are cranially at the clivus and in the sacrum at the bottom of the spine. [2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chorea Chorea (or choreia , occasionally) is an abnormal involuntary movement disorder , one of a group of neurological disorders called dyskinesias . The term chorea is derived from the Ancient Greek : χορεία ("dance"; see choreia ), as the quick movements of the feet or hands are comparable to dancing. The term hemichorea refers to chorea of one side of the body, such as chorea of one arm but not both (analogous to hemiballismus ). Chorea is characterized by brief, semi-directed, irregular movements that are not repetitive or rhythmic, but appear to flow from one muscle to the next. These 'dance-like' movements of chorea often occur with athetosis , which adds twisting and writhing movements. Walking may become difficult, and include odd postures and leg movements. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic Chronic may refer to: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_inflammatory_demyelinating_polyneuropathy Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy is an acquired immune-mediated inflammatory disorder of the peripheral nervous system characterized by progressive weakness and impaired sensory function in the legs and arms. [1] The disorder is sometimes called chronic relapsing polyneuropathy (CRP) or chronic inflammatory demyelinating poly radiculo neuropathy (because it involves the nerve roots). [2] CIDP is closely related to Guillain–Barré syndrome and it is considered the chronic counterpart of that acute disease. [3] Its symptoms are also similar to progressive inflammatory neuropathy . Several variants have been reported. Specially important are: Currently there is one special variant in which the CNS is also affected. It is termed "combined central and peripheral demyelination" (CCPD) and is special because it belongs at the same time to the CDIP syndrome and to the multiple sclerosis spectrum. [5] These cases seem to be related to the presence of anti-neurofascin autoantibodies . [ citation needed ] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_lymphocytic_leukemia Chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes too many lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell ). [2] [8] Early on there are typically no symptoms. [2] Later non-painful lymph node swelling, feeling tired, fever , night sweats , or weight loss for no clear reason may occur. [2] [9] Enlargement of the spleen and low red blood cells (anemia) may also occur. [2] [4] It typically worsens gradually over years. [2] Risk factors include having a family history of the disease. [2] Exposure to Agent Orange and certain insecticides might also be a risk. [4] CLL results in the buildup of B cell lymphocytes in the bone marrow, lymph nodes, and blood . [4] These cells do not function well and crowd out healthy blood cells . [2] CLL is divided into two main types: those with a mutated IGHV gene and those without. [4] Diagnosis is typically based on blood tests finding high numbers of mature lymphocytes and smudge cells. [5] Early-stage CLL in asymptomatic cases responds better to careful observation, as there is no evidence that early intervention treatment can alter the course of the disease. [10] Immune defects occur early in the course of CLL and these increase the risk of developing serious infection, which should be treated appropriately with antibiotics. [10] In those with significant symptoms, chemotherapy or immunotherapy may be used. [4] As of 2019 ibrutinib is often the initial medication recommended. [11] The medications fludarabine , cyclophosphamide , and rituximab were previously the initial treatment in those who are otherwise healthy. [12] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis Cirrhosis , also known as liver cirrhosis or hepatic cirrhosis , and end-stage liver disease , is the impaired liver function caused by the formation of scar tissue known as fibrosis , due to damage caused by liver disease . [9] Damage causes tissue repair and subsequent formation of scar tissue, which over time can replace normal functioning tissue leading to the impaired liver function of cirrhosis. [9] [10] The disease typically develops slowly over months or years. [1] Early symptoms may include tiredness , weakness , loss of appetite , unexplained weight loss , nausea and vomiting, and discomfort in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. [2] As the disease worsens, symptoms may include itchiness , swelling in the lower legs , fluid build-up in the abdomen , jaundice , bruising easily , and the development of spider-like blood vessels in the skin . [2] The fluid build-up in the abdomen may become spontaneously infected . [1] More serious complications include hepatic encephalopathy , bleeding from dilated veins in the esophagus , stomach or intestines , and liver cancer . [11] Cirrhosis is most commonly caused by alcoholic liver disease , non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) – (the progressive form of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ), [12] chronic hepatitis B , and chronic hepatitis C . [2] [4] Heavy drinking over a number of years can cause alcoholic liver disease. [13] NASH has a number of causes, including obesity , high blood pressure , abnormal levels of cholesterol , type 2 diabetes , and metabolic syndrome . [3] Less common causes of cirrhosis include autoimmune hepatitis , primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis that disrupt bile duct function, genetic disorders such as Wilson's disease and hereditary hemochromatosis , and chronic heart failure with liver congestion . [2] Diagnosis is based on blood tests , medical imaging , and liver biopsy . [5] [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citalopram  Citalopram , sold under the brand name Celexa among others, is an antidepressant of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) class. [4] [5] It is used to treat major depressive disorder , obsessive compulsive disorder , panic disorder , and social phobia . [4] The antidepressant effects may take one to four weeks to occur. [4] It is taken by mouth. [4] [5] Common side effects include nausea, trouble sleeping, sexual problems, shakiness, feeling tired, and sweating. [4] Serious side effects include an increased risk of suicide in those under the age of 25, serotonin syndrome , glaucoma , and QT prolongation . [4] It should not be used in someone on a MAO inhibitor . [4] Antidepressant discontinuation syndrome may occur when stopped. [4] There are concerns that use during pregnancy may harm the fetus. [3] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clear-cell_sarcoma Clear cell sarcoma is a rare form of cancer called a sarcoma . [1] It is known to occur mainly in the soft tissues and dermis. Rare forms were thought to occur in the gastrointestinal tract before they were discovered to be different and redesignated as GNET . Recurrence is common. [2] It has been associated with both EWSR1 - ATF1 and EWSR1 - CREB1 fusion transcripts. [3] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_thermometer A medical thermometer (also called clinical thermometer ) is used for measuring human or animal body temperature . The tip of the thermometer is inserted into the mouth under the tongue ( oral or sub-lingual temperature ), under the armpit ( axillary temperature ), into the rectum via the anus ( rectal temperature ), into the ear ( tympanic temperature ), or on the forehead ( temporal temperature ). The medical thermometer began as an instrument more appropriately called a water thermoscope , constructed by Galileo Galilei circa 1592–1593. It lacked an accurate scale with which to measure temperature and could be affected by changes in atmospheric pressure. [1] [2] Italian physician Santorio Santorio is the first known individual to have put a measurable scale on the thermoscope and wrote of it in 1625, though he possibly invented one as early as 1612. His models were bulky, impractical and took a fair amount of time to take an accurate oral reading of the patient's temperature. [1] [2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clonazepam Clonazepam , sold under the brand Klonopin among others, is a medication used to prevent and treat seizures , panic disorder , and the movement disorder known as akathisia . [9] It is a tranquilizer of the benzodiazepine class. [9] It is taken by mouth. [9] Effects begin within one hour and last between six and twelve hours. [7] Common side effects include sleepiness, poor coordination, and agitation. [9] Long-term use may result in tolerance , dependence , and withdrawal symptoms if stopped abruptly. [9] Dependence occurs in one-third of people who take clonazepam for longer than four weeks. [8] There is an increased risk of suicide , particularly in people who are already depressed. [9] [10] If used during pregnancy it may result in harm to the fetus. [9] Clonazepam binds to GABA A receptors , thus increasing the effect of the chief inhibitory neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA). [8] Clonazepam was patented in 1960 and went on sale in 1975 in the United States from Roche . [11] [12] It is available as a generic medication . [9] In 2018, it was the 47th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 17 million prescriptions. [13] [14] In many areas of the world it is commonly used as a recreational drug . [15] [16] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clonus Clonus is a set of involuntary and rhythmic muscular contractions and relaxations. Clonus is a sign of certain neurological conditions, particularly associated with upper motor neuron lesions involving descending motor pathways, and in many cases is, accompanied by spasticity (another form of hyperexcitability). [1] Unlike small, spontaneous twitches known as fasciculations (usually caused by lower motor neuron pathology), clonus causes large motions that are usually initiated by a reflex . Studies have shown clonus beat frequency to range from three to eight Hz on average, and may last a few seconds to several minutes depending on the patient’s condition. [1] The term is from the Greek for "violent, confused motion" Clonus is most commonly found at the ankle, specifically with a dorsiflexion/plantarflexion movement (up and down). [2] Some case studies have also reported clonus in the finger, toe, and laterally in the ankle (as opposed to the typical up and down motion). [3] [4] Clonus is typically seen in people with cerebral palsy , stroke , multiple sclerosis , spinal cord damage and hepatic encephalopathy . [2] It can occur in epilepsy as part of a generalized tonic–clonic seizure . It can also be an adverse drug reaction , such as after ingestion of potent serotonergic drugs, where clonus strongly predicts imminent serotonin toxicity ( serotonin syndrome ). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clostridioides_difficile_infection  Clostridioides difficile infection ( CDI or C-diff ), also known as Clostridium difficile infection , is a symptomatic infection due to the spore -forming bacterium Clostridioides difficile . [2] [5] Symptoms include watery diarrhea , fever, nausea, and abdominal pain . [1] It makes up about 20% of cases of antibiotic-associated diarrhea . [1] Antibiotics can contribute to detrimental changes in gut microbiota; specifically, they decrease short-chain fatty acid absorption which results in osmotic, or watery, diarrhea. [6] Complications may include pseudomembranous colitis , toxic megacolon , perforation of the colon , and sepsis . [1] Clostridioides difficile infection is spread by bacterial spores found within feces . [1] Surfaces may become contaminated with the spores with further spread occurring via the hands of healthcare workers. [1] Risk factors for infection include antibiotic or proton pump inhibitor use, hospitalization, other health problems, and older age. [1] Diagnosis is by stool culture or testing for the bacteria's DNA or toxins . [1] If a person tests positive but has no symptoms, the condition is known as C. difficile colonization rather than an infection. [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colic Colic is a form of pain that starts and stops abruptly. It occurs due to muscular contractions of a hollow tube (colon, gall bladder , ureter , etc.) in an attempt to relieve an obstruction by forcing content out. It may be accompanied by sweating and vomiting . [1] Types include: The term is from Greek κολικός kolikos , "relative to the colon ". https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coma A coma is a deep state of prolonged unconsciousness in which a person cannot be awakened, fails to respond normally to painful stimuli, light, or sound, lacks a normal wake-sleep cycle and does not initiate voluntary actions. [2] Coma patients exhibit a complete absence of wakefulness and are unable to consciously feel, speak or move. [3] Comas can be derived by natural causes, or can be medically induced . Clinically, a coma can be defined as the inability consistently to follow a one-step command. [4] It can also be defined as a score of ≤ 8 on the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) lasting ≥ 6 hours. For a patient to maintain consciousness, the components of wakefulness and awareness must be maintained. Wakefulness describes the quantitative degree of consciousness , whereas awareness relates to the qualitative aspects of the functions mediated by the cortex, including cognitive abilities such as attention, sensory perception, explicit memory, language, the execution of tasks, temporal and spatial orientation and reality judgment. [3] [5] From a neurological perspective, consciousness is maintained by the activation of the cerebral cortex —the gray matter that forms the outer layer of the brain and by the reticular activating system (RAS), a structure located within the brainstem . [6] [7] The term 'coma', from the Greek κῶμα koma , meaning deep sleep, had already been used in the Hippocratic corpus ( Epidemica ) and later by Galen (second century AD). Subsequently, it was hardly used in the known literature up to the middle of the 17th century. The term is found again in Thomas Willis ' (1621–1675) influential De anima brutorum (1672), where lethargy (pathological sleep), 'coma' (heavy sleeping), carus (deprivation of the senses) and apoplexy (into which carus could turn and which he localized in the white matter ) are mentioned. The term carus is also derived from Greek, where it can be found in the roots of several words meaning soporific or sleepy. It can still be found in the root of the term 'carotid'. Thomas Sydenham (1624–89) mentioned the term 'coma' in several cases of fever (Sydenham, 1685). [8] [9] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity In medicine , comorbidity is the presence of one or more additional conditions often co-occurring (that is, concomitant or concurrent ) with a primary condition. Comorbidity describes the effect of all other conditions an individual patient might have other than the primary condition of interest, and can be physiological or psychological. In the context of mental health, comorbidity often refers to disorders that are often coexistent with each other, such as depression and anxiety disorders. Comorbidity can indicate either a condition existing simultaneously, but independently with another condition or a related medical condition. The latter sense of the term causes some overlap with the concept of complications . For example, in longstanding diabetes mellitus , the extent to which coronary artery disease is an independent comorbidity versus a diabetic complication is not easy to measure, because both diseases are quite multivariate and there are likely aspects of both simultaneity and consequence. The same is true of intercurrent diseases in pregnancy . In other examples, the true independence or relation is not ascertainable because syndromes and associations are often identified long before pathogenetic commonalities are confirmed (and, in some examples, before they are even hypothesized ). In psychiatric diagnoses it has been argued in part that this "'use of imprecise language may lead to correspondingly imprecise thinking', [and] this usage of the term 'comorbidity' should probably be avoided." [1] However, in many medical examples, such as comorbid diabetes mellitus and coronary artery disease, it makes little difference which word is used, as long as the medical complexity is duly recognized and addressed. Many tests attempt to standardize the "weight" or value of comorbid conditions, whether they are secondary or tertiary illnesses. Each test attempts to consolidate each individual comorbid condition into a single, predictive variable that measures mortality or other outcomes. Researchers have validated such tests because of their predictive value, but no one test is as yet recognized as a  standard. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication Complication or complications may refer to: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compulsory_sterilization  Compulsory sterilization , also known as forced or coerced sterilization , is a government-mandated program to sterilize a specific group of people. Compulsory sterilization removes a person’s capacity to reproduce, usually through surgical procedures. Several countries implemented sterilization programs in the early 20th century. [1] Although such programs have been made illegal in most countries of the world, instances of forced or coerced sterilizations persist. Rationalizations for compulsory sterilization have included population control , gender discrimination , limiting the spread of HIV , [2] "gender-normalizing" surgeries for intersex people, and ethnic genocide . In some countries, transgender individuals are required to undergo sterilization before gaining legal recognition of their gender , a practice that the United Nations Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment has described as a violation of the Yogyakarta Principles . [3] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_drugs_in_the_United_Kingdom https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_bypass_surgery Coronary artery bypass surgery , also known as coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG , pronounced "cabbage") surgery , and colloquially heart bypass or bypass surgery , is a surgical procedure to restore normal blood flow to an obstructed coronary artery . A normal coronary artery transports blood to the heart muscle itself, not through the main circulatory system . There are two main approaches. In one, the left internal thoracic artery , LITA (also called left internal mammary artery, LIMA) is diverted to the left anterior descending branch of the left coronary artery . In this method, the artery is " pedicled " which means it is not detached from the origin. In the other, a great saphenous vein is removed from a leg; one end is attached to the aorta or one of its major branches, and the other end is attached to the obstructed artery immediately after the obstruction to restore blood flow. CABG is performed to relieve angina unsatisfactorily controlled by maximum tolerated anti-ischemic medication, prevent or relieve left ventricular dysfunction , and/or reduce the risk of death. CABG does not prevent myocardial infarction (heart attack). This surgery is usually performed with the heart stopped, necessitating the usage of cardiopulmonary bypass . However, two alternative techniques are also available, allowing CABG to be performed on a beating heart either without using the cardiopulmonary bypass, a procedure referred to as "off-pump" surgery, or performing beating surgery using partial assistance of the cardiopulmonary bypass, a procedure referred to as "on-pump beating" surgery. The latter procedure offers the advantages of the on-pump stopped and off-pump while minimizing their respective side-effects. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVAX  COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access , abbreviated as COVAX , is a worldwide initiative aimed at equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines directed by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance (formerly the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization, or GAVI),  the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), and the World Health Organization (WHO).  It is one of the three pillars of the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator , an initiative begun in April 2020 by the WHO, the European Commission , and the government of France as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic . COVAX coordinates international resources to enable low-to-middle-income countries equitable access to COVID-19 tests , therapies , and vaccines . [1] By 15 July 2020, 165 countries – representing 60% of the human population – had joined COVAX. [2] However, as of 11 April 2021, COVAX is falling short of its goal, having delivered 38.5 million doses despite a goal of 100 million by the end of March. [3] [4] As of 9 May 2021, the WHO has approved the Oxford–AstraZeneca , the Pfizer–BioNTech , the Moderna as well as the Sinopharm BBIBP-CorV and Johnson & Johnson vaccines for emergency use. [5] These vaccines can be distributed as part of COVAX. [5] [6] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covonia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cow_urine  Cow urine is a liquid by-product of metabolism in cows. Cow urine is also used in medicine in India , Myanmar , Nepal , and Nigeria . While cow urine and cow dung have benefits as fertilizers, the proponents' claims about its curing diseases and cancer have no scientific backing. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] Some Hindus claim that cow urine has a special significance as a medicinal drink. [6] [1] The sprinkling of cow urine is said to have a spiritual cleansing effect as well. [7] [8] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cremaster_muscle The cremaster muscle is a muscle that covers the testis and the spermatic cord . In human males , the cremaster muscle is a thin layer of striated muscle found in the inguinal canal and scrotum between the external and internal layers of spermatic fascia , surrounding the testis and spermatic cord .  The cremaster muscle is a paired structure, there being one on each side of the body. Anatomically, the lateral cremaster muscle originates from the internal oblique muscle, just superior to the inguinal canal , and the middle of the inguinal ligament. The medial cremaster muscle, which sometimes is absent, originates from the pubic tubercle and sometimes the lateral pubic crest. Both insert into the tunica vaginalis underneath the testis. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryotherapy Cryotherapy , sometimes known as cold therapy , is the local or general use of low temperatures in medical therapy . Cryotherapy may be used to treat a variety of tissue lesions . [1] The most prominent use of the term refers to the surgical treatment, specifically known as cryosurgery or cryoablation . Cryosurgery is the application of extremely low temperatures to destroy abnormal or diseased tissue and is used most commonly to treat skin conditions. Cryotherapy is used in an effort to relieve muscle pain, sprains and swelling after soft tissue damage or surgery. It is commonly used to accelerate recovery in athletes post exercise for decades. Scientifically, cryotherapy decreases the temperature of tissue surface to minimize hypoxic cell death, edema accumulation, and muscle spasms, all of which ultimately alleviate discomfort and inflammation. [2] It can be a range of treatments from the application of ice packs or immersion in ice baths (generally known as cold therapy), to the use of cold chambers. While cryotherapy is widely used, there is little evidence as to its efficacy that has been replicated or shown in large controlled studies. Its long term side effects have also not been studied. [3] [4] However, there is a study that concludes that cryotherapy has a positive impact on the short-term recovery of athletes. Cryotherapy help manage muscle soreness and facilitate recovery within the first 24 hours following a sport-related activity. Athletes who use cryotherapy within the first 24 hours to alleviate pain recovered at a faster rate than athletes who did not use cryotherapy after their sport-related activity.

It is located in Paris, France. The institute now operates several research units in cooperation with national research institutions CNRS and INSERM . There are several hundred research staff at the institute.

Institut Curie is a constituent college (associate member) of University PSL . [2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclophosphamide Cyclophosphamide ( CP ), also known as cytophosphane among other names, [3] is a medication used as chemotherapy and to suppress the immune system . [4] As chemotherapy it is used to treat lymphoma , multiple myeloma , leukemia , ovarian cancer , breast cancer , small cell lung cancer , neuroblastoma , and sarcoma . [4] As an immune suppressor it is used in nephrotic syndrome , granulomatosis with polyangiitis , and following organ transplant , among other conditions. [4] [5] It is taken by mouth or injection into a vein . [4] Most people develop side effects. [4] Common side effects include low white blood cell counts , loss of appetite, vomiting, hair loss , and bleeding from the bladder . [4] Other severe side effects include an increased future risk of cancer, infertility , allergic reactions , and pulmonary fibrosis . [4] Cyclophosphamide is in the alkylating agent and nitrogen mustard family of medications. [4] It is believed to work by interfering with the duplication of DNA and the creation of RNA . [4] Cyclophosphamide was approved for medical use in the United States in 1959. [4] It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines . [6] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclothymia Cyclothymia , also known as cyclothymic disorder is a mental disorder that involves numerous periods of symptoms of depression and periods of symptoms of elevated mood. [3] These symptoms, however, are not sufficient to be a major depressive episode or a hypomanic episode . [3] Symptoms must last for more than one year in children and two years in adults. [3] The cause of cyclothymia is unknown. [2] Risk factors include a family history of bipolar disorder . [3] Cyclothymia differs from bipolar in that major depression, mania , or hypomania have never occurred. [3] Treatment is generally with counseling and mood stabilizers such as lithium . [4] It is estimated that 0.4-1% of people have cyclothymia at some point in their life. [3] Onset is typically in late childhood to early adulthood. [3] Males and females are affected equally often. [3] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst A cyst is a closed sac, having a distinct envelope and division compared with the nearby tissue . Hence, it is a cluster of cells that have grouped together to form a sac (like the manner in which water molecules group together to form a bubble); however, the distinguishing aspect of a cyst is that the cells forming the "shell" of such a sac are distinctly abnormal (in both appearance and behaviour) when compared with all surrounding cells for that given location. A cyst may contain air, fluids, or semi-solid material. A collection of pus is called an abscess , not a cyst. Once formed, a cyst may resolve on its own. When a cyst fails to resolve, it may need to be removed surgically , but that would depend upon its type and location. Cancer -related cysts are formed as a defense mechanism for the body following the development of mutations that lead to an uncontrolled cellular division . Once that mutation has occurred, the affected cells divide incessantly and become cancerous, forming a tumor . The body encapsulates those cells to try to prevent them from continuing their division and contain the tumor, which becomes known as a cyst. That said, the cancerous cells still may mutate further and gain the ability to form their own blood vessels , from which they receive nourishment before being contained. Once that happens, the capsule becomes useless, and the tumor may advance from benign to cancerous. Some cysts are neoplastic , and thus are called cystic tumors . Many types of cysts are not neoplastic, they are dysplastic or metaplastic . Pseudocysts are similar to cysts in that they have a sac filled with fluid, but lack an epithelial lining. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cysticercosis Cysticercosis is a tissue infection caused by the young form of the pork tapeworm . [6] [1] People may have few or no symptoms for years. [3] [2] In some cases, particularly in Asia, solid lumps of between one and two centimetres may develop under the skin. [1] After months or years these lumps can become painful and swollen and then resolve. [3] [2] A specific form called neurocysticercosis , which affects the brain , can cause neurological symptoms. [2] In developing countries this is one of the most common causes of seizures . [2] Cysticercosis is usually acquired by eating food or drinking water contaminated by tapeworm eggs from human feces . [1] Among foods, uncooked vegetables are the major source. [1] The tapeworm eggs are present in the feces of a person infected with the adult worms, a condition known as taeniasis . [2] [7] Taeniasis, in the strict sense, is a different disease and is due to eating cysts in poorly cooked pork. [1] People who live with someone with the pork tapeworm have a greater risk of getting cysticercosis. [7] The diagnosis can be made by aspiration of a cyst. [2] Taking pictures of the brain with computer tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are most useful for the diagnosis of disease in the brain. [2] An increased number of a type of white blood cell , called eosinophils , in the cerebral spinal fluid and blood is also an indicator. [2] Infection can be effectively prevented by personal hygiene and sanitation : [1] this includes cooking pork well, proper toilets and sanitary practices, and improved access to clean water. [1] Treating those with taeniasis is important to prevent spread. [1] Treating the disease when it does not involve the nervous system may not be required. [2] Treatment of those with neurocysticercosis may be with the medications praziquantel or albendazole . [1] These may be required for long periods. [1] Steroids , for anti-inflammation during treatment, and anti-seizure medications may also be required. [1] Surgery is sometimes done to remove the cysts. [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dacarbazine Dacarbazine ( DTIC ), [1] also known as imidazole carboxamide , is a chemotherapy medication used in the treatment of melanoma and Hodgkin's lymphoma . [2] For Hodgkin's it is often used together with vinblastine , bleomycin , and doxorubicin . [2] It is given by injection into a vein . [2] Common side effects include loss of appetite, vomiting, low white blood cell count , and low platelets . [2] Other serious side effects include liver problems and allergic reactions . [2] It is unclear if use in pregnancy is safe for the baby. [2] Dacarbazine is in the alkylating agent and purine analog families of medication. [2] Dacarbazine was approved for medical use in the United States in 1975. [2] It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines . [3] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Date_rape_drug A date rape drug is any drug that incapacitates another person and renders that person vulnerable to a sexual assault , including rape . The substances are associated with date rape because of reported incidents of their use in the context of two people dating, during which the victim is sexually assaulted or raped or suffers other harm. The substances are not exclusively used to perpetrate sexual assault or rape, but are the properties or side-effects of substances normally used for legitimate medical purposes. One of the most common incapacitating agents for date rape is alcohol , administered either surreptitiously [1] or consumed voluntarily, [2] rendering the victim unable to make informed decisions or give consent. No comprehensive data exists on the frequency of drug-facilitated sexual assaults involving the use of surreptitious drug administration, due to the report rate of assaults and because rape victims who do report are often either never tested for these drugs, are tested for the wrong ones, or the tests are administered after the drug has been metabolized and left their body. [3] A 1999 study of 1,179 urine specimens from victims of suspected drug-facilitated sexual assaults in 49 American states found six (0.5%) positive for Rohypnol , 97 (8%) positive for other benzodiazepines, 48 (4.1%) positive for GHB , 451 (38%) positive for alcohol and 468 (40%) negative for any of the drugs searched for. [4] A similar study of 2,003 urine samples of victims of suspected drug-facilitated sexual assaults found less than 2% tested positive for Rohypnol or GHB. [5] The samples used in these studies could only be verified as having been submitted within a 72-hour time frame or a 48-hour time frame. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_by_natural_causes In many legal jurisdictions , the manner of death is a determination, typically made by the coroner , medical examiner , police, or similar officials, and recorded as a vital statistic .  Within the United States and the United Kingdom, a distinction is made between the cause of death (sometimes referred to as the "mechanism of death"), which is a specific disease or injury, versus manner of death, which is primarily a legal determination. Different categories are used in different jurisdictions, but manner of death determinations include everything from very broad categories like "natural" and "homicide" to specific manners like "traffic accident" or "gunshot wound".  In some cases an autopsy is performed, either due to general legal requirements, because the medical cause of death is uncertain, upon the request of family members or guardians, or because the circumstances of death were suspicious. International Classification of Disease (ICD) codes can be used to record manner and cause of death in a systematic way that makes it easy to compile statistics and more feasible to compare events across jurisdictions. [1] A death by natural causes results from an illness or an internal malfunction of the body not directly caused by external forces, other than infectious disease .  For example, a person dying from complications from influenza and/or pneumonia (infections), a stroke , a heart attack (internal body malfunctions), or sudden heart failure would most likely be listed as having died from natural causes.  "Death by natural causes" is sometimes used as a euphemism for "dying of old age", which is considered problematic as a cause of death (as opposed to a specific age-related disease ); there are also many non-age-related causes of "natural" death, for legal manner-of-death purposes.  (See Cause of death § Age ) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decongestant A decongestant , or nasal decongestant , is a type of pharmaceutical drug that is used to relieve nasal congestion in the upper respiratory tract . The active ingredient in most decongestants is either pseudoephedrine or phenylephrine (the latter of which has disputed effectiveness ). Intranasal corticosteroids can also be used as decongestants and antihistamines can be used to alleviate runny nose , nasal itch , and sneezing . [1] Topical decongestants on topical application as dilute solution (0.05–0.1%) produce local vasoconstriction . Regular use of decongestants for long periods should be avoided because mucosal ciliary function is impaired: atrophic rhinitis and anosmia (loss of the sense of smell) can occur due to persistent vasoconstriction. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defibrillation Defibrillation is a treatment for life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias , specifically ventricular fibrillation (VF) and non-perfusing ventricular tachycardia (VT). [1] [2] A defibrillator delivers a dose of electric current (often called a counter-shock ) to the heart . Although not fully understood, this process depolarizes a large amount of the heart muscle , ending the dysrhythmia. Subsequently, the body's natural pacemaker in the sinoatrial node of the heart is able to re-establish normal sinus rhythm . [3] A heart which is in asystole (flatline) cannot be restarted by a defibrillator, but would be treated by cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). In contrast to defibrillation, synchronized electrical cardioversion is an electrical shock delivered in synchrony to the cardiac cycle . [4] Although the person may still be critically ill , cardioversion normally aims to end poorly perfusing cardiac dysrhythmias , such as supraventricular tachycardia . [1] [2] Defibrillators can be external, transvenous, or implanted ( implantable cardioverter-defibrillator ), depending on the type of device used or needed. [5] Some external units, known as automated external defibrillators (AEDs), automate the diagnosis of treatable rhythms, meaning that lay responders or bystanders are able to use them successfully with little or no training. [2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degenerative_disease Degenerative disease is the result of a continuous process based on degenerative cell changes, affecting tissues or organs , which will increasingly deteriorate over time. [1] In neurodegenerative diseases , cells of the central nervous system stop working or die via neurodegeneration . An example of this is Alzheimer's disease . [2] The other two common groups of degenerative diseases are those that affect circulatory system (e.g. coronary artery disease ) and neoplastic diseases (e.g. cancers ). [1] Many degenerative diseases exist and some are related to aging . Normal bodily wear or lifestyle choices (such as exercise or eating habits) may worsen degenerative diseases, but this depends on the disease. [1] Sometimes the main or partial cause behind such diseases is genetic . [3] Thus some are clearly hereditary like Huntington's disease . [4] Sometimes the cause is viruses , poisons or other chemicals. The cause may also be unknown. [3] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delusion  A delusion is a fixed belief that is not amenable to change in light of conflicting evidence. [1] As a pathology, it is distinct from a belief based on false or incomplete information, confabulation , dogma , illusion , or some other misleading effects of perception as individuals with these beliefs are able to change or readjust their beliefs upon viewing the evidence for these beliefs. Delusions have been found to occur in the context of many pathological states (both general physical and mental) and are of particular diagnostic importance in psychotic disorders including schizophrenia , paraphrenia , manic episodes of bipolar disorder , and psychotic depression . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_braces Dental braces (also known as braces , orthodontic cases , or cases ) are devices used in orthodontics that align and straighten teeth and help  position them with regard to a person's bite, while also aiming to improve dental health. Braces also fix gaps. They are often used to correct underbites , as well as malocclusions , overbites , open bites, deep bites , cross bites , crooked teeth, and various other flaws of the teeth and jaw . Braces can be either cosmetic or structural. Dental braces are often used in conjunction with other orthodontic appliances to help widen the palate or jaws and to otherwise assist in shaping the teeth and jaws. The application of braces moves the teeth as a result of force and pressure on the teeth. There are traditionally four basic elements used: brackets, bonding material, arch wire, and ligature elastic (also called an “O-ring”). The teeth move when the arch wire puts pressure on the brackets and teeth. Sometimes springs or rubber bands are used to put more force in a specific direction. [ medical citation needed ] [1] Braces have constant pressure which, over time, move teeth into the desired positions. The process loosens the tooth after which new bone grows in to support the tooth in its new position. This is called bone remodeling . Bone remodeling is a biomechanical process responsible for making bones stronger in response to sustained load-bearing activity and weaker in the absence of carrying a load. Bones are made of cells called osteoclasts and osteoblasts. Two different kinds of bone resorption are possible: direct resorption, which starts from the lining cells of the alveolar bone, and indirect or retrograde resorption, which occurs when the periodontal ligament has been subjected to an excessive amount and duration of compressive stress. [2] Another important factor associated with tooth movement is bone deposition. Bone deposition occurs in the distracted periodontal ligament. Without bone deposition, the tooth will loosen, and voids will occur distal to the direction of tooth movement. [3] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry  Dentistry , also known as dental medicine and oral medicine , is a branch of medicine that consists of the study, diagnosis , prevention, and treatment of diseases , disorders, and conditions of the oral cavity , commonly in the dentition but also the oral mucosa , and of adjacent and related structures and tissues, particularly in the maxillofacial (jaw and facial) area. [1] Although primarily associated with teeth among the general public, the field of dentistry or dental medicine is not limited to teeth but includes other aspects of the craniofacial complex including the temporomandibular joint and other supporting, muscular, lymphatic, nervous, vascular, and anatomical structures. Dentistry is often also understood to subsume the now largely defunct medical specialty of stomatology (the study of the mouth and its disorders and diseases) for which reason the two terms are used interchangeably in certain regions. [ where? ] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentures Dentures (also known as false teeth ) are prosthetic devices constructed to replace missing teeth , and are supported by the surrounding soft and hard tissues of the oral cavity . Conventional dentures are removable ( removable partial denture or complete denture ). However, there are many denture designs, some which rely on bonding or clasping onto teeth or dental implants ( fixed prosthodontics ). There are two main categories of dentures, the distinction being whether they are used to replace missing teeth on the mandibular arch or on the maxillary arch . Dentures do not feel like real teeth, nor do they function like real teeth. [ citation needed ] Dentures can help people through: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_personality_disorder Dependent personality disorder ( DPD ) is a personality disorder that is characterized by a pervasive psychological dependence on other people. This personality disorder is a long-term condition [1] in which people depend on others to meet their emotional and physical needs, with only a minority achieving normal levels of independence. Dependent personality disorder is a Cluster C personality disorder , [2] characterized by excessive fear and anxiety. It begins by early adulthood, and it is present in a variety of contexts and is associated with inadequate functioning. Symptoms can include anything from extreme passivity, devastation or helplessness when relationships end, avoidance of responsibilities and severe submission. People who have dependent personality disorder are overdependent on other people when it comes to making decisions. They cannot make a decision on their own as they need constant approval from other people. Consequently, individuals diagnosed with DPD tend to place needs and opinions of others above their own as they do not have the confidence to trust their decisions. This kind of behaviour can explain why people with DPD tend to show passive and clingy behaviour. These individuals display a fear of separation and cannot stand being alone. When alone, they experience feelings of isolation and loneliness due to their overwhelming dependence on other people. Generally people with DPD are also pessimistic: they expect the worst out of situations or believe that the worst will happen. They tend to be more introverted and are more sensitive to criticism and fear rejection. [3] People with a history of neglect and an abusive upbringing are more susceptible to develop DPD, specifically those involved in long-term abusive relationships. Those with overprotective or authoritarian parents are also more at risk to develop DPD. Having a family history of anxiety disorder can play a role in the development of DPD as a 2004 twin study found a 0.81 heritability for personality disorders collectively. [4] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depressant A depressant , or central depressant , is a drug that lowers neurotransmission levels, which is to depress or reduce arousal or stimulation , in various areas of the brain. [1] Depressants are also occasionally referred to as "downers" as they lower the level of arousal when taken. Stimulants or "uppers" increase mental and/or physical function, hence the opposite drug class of depressants is stimulants, not antidepressants . Depressants are widely used throughout the world as prescription medicines and as illicit substances . Alcohol is a very prominent depressant. Alcohol can be and is more likely to be a large problem among teenagers and young adults. When depressants are used, effects often include ataxia , anxiolysis , pain relief , sedation or somnolence , and cognitive / memory impairment , as well as in some instances euphoria , dissociation , muscle relaxation , lowered blood pressure or heart rate , respiratory depression , and anticonvulsant effects. Depressants also act to produce anesthesia . Cannabis may sometimes be considered a depressant due to one of its components, cannabidiol . The latter is known to treat insomnia, anxiety and muscle spasms similar to other depressive drugs. However, tetrahydrocannabinol , another component, may slow brain function to a small degree while reducing reaction to stimuli, it is generally considered to be a stimulant and main psychoactive agent to sometimes cause anxiety , panic and psychosis instead. Other depressants can include drugs like Xanax (a benzodiazepine ) and a number of opiates . Depressants exert their effects through a number of different pharmacological mechanisms, the most prominent of which include facilitation of GABA , and inhibition of glutamatergic or monoaminergic activity. Other examples are chemicals that modify the electrical signaling inside the body, the most prominent of these being bromides and body blockers . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derealization Derealization is an alteration in the perception of the external world, causing sufferers to perceive it as unreal, distant, distorted or falsified. Other symptoms include feeling as though one's environment is lacking in spontaneity, emotional coloring, and depth. [1] It is a dissociative symptom that may appear in moments of severe stress. [2] Derealization is a subjective experience pertaining to a person's perception of the outside world, while depersonalization is a related symptom characterized by dissociation towards one's own body and mental processes. The two are commonly experienced in conjunction with one another, but are also known to occur independently. [3] Chronic derealization is fairly rare, and may be caused by occipital – temporal dysfunction. [4] Experiencing derealization for long periods of time or having recurring episodes can be indicative of many psychological disorders, and can cause significant distress among sufferers. However, temporary derealization symptoms are commonly experienced by the general population a few times throughout their lives, with a lifetime prevalence of up to 26-74% and a prevalence of 31–66% at the time of a traumatic event . [5] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatology Dermatology is the branch of medicine dealing with the skin . [1] [2] It is a speciality with both medical and surgical aspects. [3] [4] [5] A dermatologist is a specialist medical doctor who manages diseases related to skin, hair, nails, and some cosmetic problems. [2] [6] Attested in English in 1819, the word "dermatology" derives from the Greek δέρματος ( dermatos ), genitive of δέρμα ( derma ), "skin" [7] (itself from δέρω dero , "to flay" [8] ) and -λογία -logia . Neo-Latin dermatologia was coined in 1630, an anatomical term with various French and German uses attested from the 1730s. [9]  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detoxification Detoxification or detoxication ( detox for short) [1] is the physiological or medicinal removal of toxic substances from a living organism , including the human body, which is mainly carried out by the liver. Additionally, it can refer to the period of drug withdrawal during which an organism returns to homeostasis after long-term use of an addictive substance. [2] [3] In medicine , detoxification can be achieved by decontamination of poison ingestion and the use of antidotes as well as techniques such as dialysis and (in a limited number of cases) chelation therapy . [4] Many alternative medicine practitioners promote various types of detoxification such as detoxification diets . Scientists have described these as a "waste of time and money". [5] [6] Sense About Science , a UK-based charitable trust, determined that most such dietary "detox" claims lack any supporting evidence. [7] [8] The liver and kidney are naturally capable of detox, as are intracellular (specifically, inner membrane of mitochondria or in the endoplasmic reticulum of cells) proteins such as CYP enyzmes . In cases of kidney failure , the action of the kidneys is mimicked by dialysis ; kidney and liver transplants are also used for kidney and liver failure, respectively. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dextromethorphan Dextromethorphan , often referred to as DXM , is a medication most often used as a cough suppressant in over-the-counter cold and cough medicines. It is sold in syrup , tablet, spray, and lozenge forms. It is in the morphinan class of medications with sedative , dissociative , and stimulant properties (at lower doses). Dextromethorphan does not have a significant affinity for the mu-opioid receptor activity typical of morphinan compounds and exerts its therapeutic effects through several other receptors. [3] In its pure form, dextromethorphan occurs as a white powder. [4] Dextromethorphan is also used recreationally . When exceeding approved dosages, dextromethorphan acts as a dissociative hallucinogen . It has multiple mechanisms of action , including actions as a nonselective serotonin reuptake inhibitor [5] and a sigma-1 receptor agonist. [6] [7] Dextromethorphan and its major metabolite , dextrorphan , also block the NMDA receptor at high doses, which produces effects similar to other dissociative anesthetics such as ketamine , nitrous oxide , and phencyclidine . It was patented in 1949 and approved for medical use in 1953. [8] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_and_Statistical_Manual_of_Mental_Disorders The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( DSM ; latest edition: DSM-5 , publ. 2013) is a publication by the American Psychiatric Association (APA) for the classification of mental disorders using a common language and standard criteria. It is used - mainly in the USA - by clinicians, researchers, psychiatric drug regulation agencies, health insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies , the legal system, and policymakers. The DSM evolved from systems for collecting census and psychiatric hospital statistics, as well as from a United States Army manual. Revisions since its first publication in 1952 have incrementally added to the total number of mental disorders , while removing those no longer considered to be mental disorders. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_behavior_therapy  Dialectical behavior therapy ( DBT ) is an evidence-based [1] psychotherapy that began with efforts to treat borderline personality disorder (also known as Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder). [2] There is evidence that DBT can be useful in treating mood disorders , suicidal ideation , and for change in behavioral patterns such as self-harm and substance use . [3] DBT evolved into a process in which the therapist and client work with acceptance and change-oriented strategies, and ultimately balance and synthesize them, in a manner comparable to the philosophical dialectical process of hypothesis and antithesis, followed by synthesis. [2] This approach was developed by Marsha M. Linehan , a psychology researcher at the University of Washington , to help people increase their emotional and cognitive regulation by learning about the triggers that lead to reactive states and helping to assess which coping skills to apply in the sequence of events, thoughts, feelings, and behaviors to help avoid undesired reactions. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diazepam  Diazepam , first marketed as Valium , is a medicine of the benzodiazepine family that acts as an anxiolytic . [9] It is commonly used to treat a range of conditions, including anxiety , seizures , alcohol withdrawal syndrome , benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome , muscle spasms , insomnia , and restless legs syndrome . [9] It may also be used to cause memory loss during certain medical procedures. [10] [11] It can be taken by mouth , inserted into the rectum , injected into muscle , injected into a vein or used as a nasal spray . [5] [11] When given into a vein, effects begin in one to five minutes and last up to an hour. [11] By mouth, effects begin after 15 to 60 minutes. [12] Common side effects include sleepiness and trouble with coordination. [7] [11] Serious side effects are rare. [9] They include suicide , decreased breathing, and an increased risk of seizures if used too frequently in those with epilepsy . [9] [11] [13] Occasionally, excitement or agitation may occur. [14] [15] Long term use can result in tolerance , dependence , and withdrawal symptoms on dose reduction. [9] Abrupt stopping after long-term use can be potentially dangerous. [9] After stopping, cognitive problems may persist for six months or longer. [14] It is not recommended during pregnancy or breastfeeding. [11] Its mechanism of action is by increasing the effect of the neurotransmitter gamma -aminobutyric acid (GABA). [14] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diclofenac  Diclofenac , sold under the brand name Voltaren among others, is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to treat pain and inflammatory diseases such as gout . [5] It is taken by mouth, rectally in a suppository, used by injection, or applied to the skin. [5] [7] Improvements in pain last for as much as eight hours. [5] It is also available in combination with misoprostol in an effort to decrease stomach problems. [8] Common side effects include abdominal pain , gastrointestinal bleeding , nausea, dizziness, headache, and swelling. [5] Serious side effects may include heart disease , stroke , kidney problems , and stomach ulceration . [8] [5] Use is not recommended in the third trimester of pregnancy . [5] It is likely safe during breastfeeding . [8] It is believed to work by decreasing the production of prostaglandin . [9] It blocks both cycloxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cycloxygenase-2 (COX-2). [5] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietitian A dietitian , medical dietitian , or dietician [1] is an expert in identifying and treating disease-related malnutrition and in conducting medical nutrition therapy , for example designing an enteral tube feeding regimen or mitigating the effects of cancer cachexia . Many dietitians work in hospitals and usually see specific patients where a nutritional assessment and intervention has been requested by a doctor or nurse, for example if a patient has lost their ability to swallow or requires artificial nutrition due to intestinal failure. Dietitians are the only regulated healthcare professionals licensed to assess, diagnose, and treat such problems. In the United Kingdom, dietitian is a 'protected title', meaning identifying yourself as a dietitian without appropriate education and registration is prohibited by law. [2] [3] [4] A registered dietitian (RD) (UK/USA) or registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN) (USA) [5] [6] [7] meets all of a set of special academic and professional requirements, including the completion of a bachelor's and/or master's degree in nutrition and dietetics (or equivalent). 1 or more internships (USA) or clinical placements (UK) must also be completed. These may be allocated and monitored by the university as part of the structured degree programme (UK) or may be applied for separately (USA). Roughly half of all RD(N)s hold graduate degrees [8] and many have certifications in specialized fields such as nutrition support, sports, paediatrics, renal, oncological, food-allergy, or gerontological nutrition. Although assessment priorities differ depending on the specialist area, a patient's medical and surgical history, biochemistry, diet history, eating and exercise habits usually form the basis of assessment. The RD(N) negotiates a treatment plan with the patient which may include prescriptions, and follow-up visits often focus on maintenance and monitoring progress. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilation_and_curettage Dilation (or dilatation ) and curettage ( D&C ) refers to the dilation (widening/opening) of the cervix and surgical removal of part of the lining of the uterus and/or contents of the uterus by scraping and scooping ( curettage ). It is a gynecologic procedure used for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, and is the most commonly used method for first trimester miscarriage or abortion . [1] [2] [3] [4] D&C normally refers to a procedure involving a curette , also called sharp curettage . [2] However, some sources use the term D&C to refer to any procedure that involves the processes of dilation and removal of uterine contents, which includes the more common suction curettage procedures of manual and electric vacuum aspiration . [5] D&Cs may be performed in pregnant and non-pregnant patients, for different clinical indications. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability  A disability is any medical condition that makes it more difficult for a person to do certain activities or effectively interact with the world around them (socially or materially). These conditions, or impairments, may be cognitive , developmental , intellectual , mental , physical , sensory , or a combination of multiple factors. Impairments causing disability may be present from birth or occur during a person's lifetime. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities defines disability as: long-term physical, mental, intellectual or sensory impairments which in interaction with various barriers may hinder [a person's] full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others. [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diseases_Database The Diseases Database is a free website that provides information about the relationships between medical conditions, symptoms , and medications . The database is run by Medical Object Oriented Software Enterprises Ltd, a company based in London. [1] The site's stated aim is "education, background reading and general interest" with an intended audience "physicians, other clinical healthcare workers and students of these professions". The editor of the site is stated as Malcolm H Duncan, a UK qualified medical doctor. [2] The Diseases Database is based on a collection of about 8,500 concepts, called "items", related to human medicine including diseases, drugs, symptoms, physical signs and abnormal laboratory results. [3] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distress_(medicine) In medicine, distress is an aversive state in which a person is unable to completely adapt to stressors and their resulting stress and shows maladaptive behaviors. [1] It can be evident in the presence of various phenomena, such as inappropriate social interaction (e.g., aggression, passivity, or withdrawal). Distress is the opposite of eustress , a positive stress that motivates people. Stress can be created by influences such as work , school, peers or co-workers, family and death. Other influences vary by age. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diuretic A diuretic ( / ˌ d aɪ j ʊ ˈ r ɛ t ɪ k / ) is any substance that promotes diuresis , the increased production of urine . This includes forced diuresis . There are several categories of diuretics. All diuretics increase the excretion of water from bodies, although each class does so in a distinct way. Alternatively, an antidiuretic , such as vasopressin ( antidiuretic hormone ), is an agent or drug which reduces the excretion of water in urine. In medicine , diuretics are used to treat heart failure , liver cirrhosis , hypertension , influenza , water poisoning , and certain kidney diseases . Some diuretics, such as acetazolamide , help to make the urine more alkaline and are helpful in increasing excretion of substances such as aspirin in cases of overdose or poisoning. Diuretics are sometimes abused by people with an eating disorder , especially people with bulimia nervosa , with the goal of losing weight. The antihypertensive actions of some diuretics ( thiazides and loop diuretics in particular) are independent of their diuretic effect. [1] [2] That is, the reduction in blood pressure is not due to decreased blood volume resulting from increased urine production , but occurs through other mechanisms and at lower doses than that required to produce diuresis . Indapamide was specifically designed with this in mind, and has a larger therapeutic window for hypertension (without pronounced diuresis) than most other diuretics. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctors_Without_Borders  Médecins Sans Frontières ( MSF ; pronounced [medsɛ̃ sɑ̃ fʁɔ̃tjɛʁ] ( listen ) ), sometimes rendered in English as Doctors Without Borders , is an international humanitarian medical non-governmental organisation (NGO) of French origin best known for its projects in conflict zones and in countries affected by endemic diseases . In 2019, the group was active in 70 countries with over 35,000 personnel mostly local doctors, nurses and other medical professionals, logistical experts, water and sanitation engineers and administrators. [2] Private donors provide about 90% of the organisation's funding, while corporate donations provide the rest, giving MSF an annual budget of approximately US$1.63 billion. [3] Médecins Sans Frontières was founded in 1971, in the aftermath of the Biafra secession , by a small group of French doctors and journalists who sought to expand accessibility to medical care across national boundaries and irrespective of race , religion , creed or political affiliation. [4] To that end, the organisation emphasises "independence and impartiality", and explicitly precludes political, economic, or religious factors in its decision making. For these reasons, it limits the amount of funding received from governments or intergovernmental organisations. These principles have allowed MSF to speak freely with respect to acts of war, corruption, or other hindrances to medical care or human well-being. Only once in its history, during the 1994 genocide in Rwanda , has the organisation called for military intervention. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doping_in_sport  In competitive sports, doping is the use of banned athletic performance-enhancing drugs by athletic competitors.  The term doping is widely used by organizations that regulate sporting competitions. The use of drugs to enhance performance is considered unethical, and therefore prohibited, by most international sports organizations, including the International Olympic Committee . Furthermore, athletes (or athletic programs) taking explicit measures to evade detection exacerbate the ethical violation with overt deception and cheating . The origins of doping in sports go back to the very creation of sport itself. From ancient usage of substances in chariot racing to more recent controversies in baseball and cycling , popular views among athletes have varied widely from country to country over the years. The general trend among authorities and sporting organizations over the past several decades has been to strictly regulate the use of drugs in sport. The reasons for the ban are mainly the health risks of performance-enhancing drugs, the equality of opportunity for athletes, and the exemplary effect of drug-free sport for the public. Anti-doping authorities state that using performance-enhancing drugs goes against the "spirit of sport". https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorland%27s_Medical_Dictionary Dorland's is the brand name of a family of medical reference works (including dictionaries , spellers and word books, and spell-check software ) in various media spanning printed books, CD-ROMs, and online content. The flagship products are Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary (currently in its 32nd edition) and Dorland's Pocket Medical Dictionary (currently in its 29th edition). The principal dictionary was first published in 1890 as the American Illustrated Medical Dictionary , including 770 pages. The pocket edition, called the American Pocket Medical Dictionary , was first published in 1898, consisting of just over 500 pages. With the death of the editor William Alexander Newman Dorland , AM, MD in 1956, the dictionaries were retitled to incorporate his name, which was how they had generally come to be known.  The illustrated dictionary had grown to 2208 pages for the 31st edition. The dictionaries were historically published by Saunders . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_withdrawal Drug withdrawal , drug withdrawal syndrome , or substance withdrawal syndrome , [1] is the group of symptoms that occur upon the abrupt discontinuation or decrease in the intake of medicational or recreational drugs . In order for the symptoms of withdrawal to occur, one must have first developed a form of drug dependence . This may occur as physical dependence , psychological dependence or both. Drug dependence develops from consuming one or more substances over a period of time. Dependence arises in a dose-dependent manner and produces withdrawal symptoms that vary with the type of drug that is consumed. For example, prolonged use of an antidepressant medication is likely to cause a much different reaction when discontinued compared to discontinuation of an opioid , such as heroin . Withdrawal symptoms from opiates include anxiety, sweating, vomiting, and diarrhea. Alcohol withdrawal symptoms include irritability, fatigue, shaking, sweating, and nausea. Withdrawal from nicotine can cause irritability, fatigue, insomnia, headache, and difficulty concentrating. Many prescription and legal nonprescription substances can also cause withdrawal symptoms when individuals stop consuming them, even if they were taken as directed by a physician. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchenne_muscular_dystrophy Duchenne muscular dystrophy ( DMD ) is a severe type of muscular dystrophy that primarily affects boys. [3] Muscle weakness usually begins around the age of four, and worsens quickly. [2] Muscle loss typically occurs first in the thighs and pelvis followed by the arms. [3] This can result in trouble standing up. [3] Most are unable to walk by the age of 12. [2] Affected muscles may look larger due to increased fat content. [3] Scoliosis is also common. [3] Some may have intellectual disability . [3] Females with a single copy of the defective gene may show mild symptoms. [3] The disorder is X-linked recessive . [3] About two thirds of cases are inherited from a person's mother, while one third of cases are due to a new mutation . [3] It is caused by a mutation in the gene for the protein dystrophin . [3] Dystrophin is important to maintain the muscle fiber's cell membrane . [3] Genetic testing can often make the diagnosis at birth. [3] Those affected also have a high level of creatine kinase in their blood . [3] Although there is no known cure, physical therapy , braces , and corrective surgery may help with some symptoms. [2] Assisted ventilation may be required in those with weakness of breathing muscles . [3] Medications used include steroids to slow muscle degeneration, anticonvulsants to control seizures and some muscle activity, and immunosuppressants to delay damage to dying muscle cells . [2] Gene therapy , as a treatment, is in the early stages of study in humans. [3] A small initial study using gene therapy has given some children improved muscle strength, but long term effects are unknown as of 2020. [6] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysautonomia Dysautonomia or autonomic dysfunction is a condition in which the autonomic nervous system (ANS) does not work properly. This may affect the functioning of the heart , bladder , intestines , sweat glands , pupils , and blood vessels. Dysautonomia has many causes, not all of which may be classified as neuropathic . [5] A number of conditions can feature dysautonomia, such as Parkinson's disease , multiple system atrophy , and dementia with Lewy bodies , [6] Ehlers-Danlos syndromes , [7] autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy and autonomic neuropathy , [8] HIV/AIDS , [9] autonomic failure , and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome . The diagnosis is achieved through functional testing of the ANS, focusing on the affected organ system . Investigations may be performed to identify underlying disease processes that may have led to the development of symptoms or autonomic neuropathy. Symptomatic treatment is available for many symptoms associated with dysautonomia, and some disease processes can be directly treated. [10] The symptoms of dysautonomia, which are numerous and vary widely for each individual, are due to inefficient or unbalanced efferent signals sent via both systems. [ medical citation needed ] The primary symptoms in individuals with dysautonomia include https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dystonia  Dystonia is a neurological hyperkinetic movement disorder syndrome in which sustained or repetitive muscle contractions result in twisting and repetitive movements or abnormal fixed postures. [3] The movements may resemble a tremor . Dystonia is often intensified or exacerbated by physical activity, and symptoms may progress into adjacent muscles. [4] The disorder may be hereditary or caused by other factors such as birth-related or other physical trauma , infection , poisoning (e.g., lead poisoning ) or reaction to pharmaceutical drugs , particularly neuroleptics , [3] or stress. Treatment must be highly customized to the needs of the individual and may include oral medications, chemodenervation botulinum neurotoxin injections, physical therapy, or other supportive therapies, and surgical procedures such as deep brain stimulation . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroconvulsive_therapy Electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT ) is a psychiatric treatment where a generalized seizure (without muscular convulsions ) is electrically induced to manage refractory mental disorders . [1] Typically, 70 to 120 volts are applied externally to the patient's head resulting in approximately 800 milliamperes of direct current passed through the brain, for 100 milliseconds to 6 seconds duration, either from temple to temple (bilateral ECT) or from front to back of one side of the head (unilateral ECT). The ECT procedure was first conducted in 1938 by Italian psychiatrist Ugo Cerletti [2] and rapidly replaced less safe and effective forms of biological treatments in use at the time. ECT is often used with informed consent [3] as a safe and effective intervention for major depressive disorder , mania , and catatonia . [4] ECT machines were originally placed in the Class III category by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1976. [5] They were re-classified as Class II devices, for treatment of catatonia, major depressive disorder, and bipolar disorder , in 2018. [6] Aside from effects on the brain, the general physical risks of ECT are similar to those of brief general anesthesia . [7] : 259 Immediately following treatment, the most common adverse effects are confusion and transient memory loss. [4] [8] Among treatments for severely depressed pregnant women, ECT is one of the least harmful to the fetus . [9] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrology Electrology is the practice of electrical hair removal to permanently remove human hair from the body. Electrolysis is the actual process of removing hair using electricity. In electrolysis, a qualified professional called an electrologist slides a hair-thin, solid metal probe into each hair follicle without puncturing the skin (when inserted properly). Electricity is delivered to the follicle through the probe, which causes localized damage to the areas that generate hairs, either through the formation of caustic sodium hydroxide (the galvanic method), overheating (thermolysis), or both (the blend method). All three methods (galvanic, thermolysis, and blend) have their own merits, and one method is not better than another. The success depends on the skill of the electrologist, the type of hair being removed, the condition of the skin and the pain threshold of the client. All three methods, when properly performed, can be thorough at destroying the hair matrix cells, and leaving follicles incapable of regrowing hair. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eli_Lilly_and_Company  Eli Lilly and Company is an American pharmaceutical company headquartered in Indianapolis, Indiana , with offices in 18 countries. Its products are sold in approximately 125 countries. The company was founded in 1876 by, and named after, Col. Eli Lilly , a pharmaceutical chemist and veteran of the American Civil War . [4] Lilly's notable achievements include being the first company to mass-produce the polio vaccine developed by Jonas Salk , and insulin . It was one of the first pharmaceutical companies to produce human insulin using recombinant DNA including Humulin ( insulin medication ), Humalog ( insulin lispro ), and the first approved biosimilar insulin product in the US, Basaglar ( insulin glargine ). [5] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabethan_collar An Elizabethan collar , E-collar , Buster collar or pet cone (sometimes humorously called a pet lamp-shade , pet radar dish , dog-saver , or cone of shame ) is a protective medical device worn by an animal, usually a cat or dog. Shaped like a truncated cone, its purpose is to prevent the animal from biting or licking at its body or scratching at its head or neck while wounds or injuries heal . [1] The collars are named from the ruffs worn in Elizabethan times .  A U.S. patent was filed by Frank L. Johnson in 1959. [2] The device is generally attached to the pet's usual collar with strings or tabs passed through holes punched in the sides of the plastic. The neck of the collar should be short enough to let the animal eat and drink. Although most pets adjust to them quite well, others will not eat or drink with the collar in place and the collar is temporarily removed for meals. [3] While purpose-made collars can be purchased from veterinarians or pet stores, they can also be made from plastic and cardboard or by using plastic flowerpots, wastebaskets, buckets or lampshades. Modern collars might involve soft fabric trim along the edges to increase comfort and velcro surfaces for ease of attachment and removal. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department  An emergency department ( ED ), also known as an accident & emergency department ( A&E ), emergency room ( ER ), emergency ward ( EW ) or casualty department , is a medical treatment facility specializing in emergency medicine , the acute care of patients who present without prior appointment; either by their own means or by that of an ambulance . The emergency department is usually found in a hospital or other primary care center. Due to the unplanned nature of patient attendance, the department must provide initial treatment for a broad spectrum of illnesses and injuries, some of which may be life-threatening and require immediate attention. In some countries, emergency departments have become important entry points for those without other means of access to medical care. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_medical_dispatcher An emergency medical dispatcher is a professional telecommunicator , tasked with the gathering of information related to medical emergencies, the provision of assistance and instructions by voice, prior to the arrival of emergency medical services (EMS), and the dispatching and support of EMS resources responding to an emergency call. The term "emergency medical dispatcher" is also a certification level and a professional designation, certified through the Association of Public-Safety Communications Officials-International (APSCOI) [1] and the International Academies of Emergency Dispatch. [2] Many dispatchers, whether certified or not, will dispatch using a standard emergency medical dispatch protocol. Dispatchers have always played an essential role of emergency medical services (EMS). At its most basic, the role of the dispatcher has been to identify the problem and the location of the patient, and then identify an ambulance that can be sent to the location. Prior to the professionalization of emergency medical services, this step in the process was often informal; the caller would simply call the local ambulance service, the telephone call would be answered (in many cases by the ambulance attendant who would be responding to the call), the location and problem information would be gathered, and an ambulance assigned to complete the task. The ambulance would then complete the call, return to the station, and wait for the next telephone call. Although earlier experiments with the use of radio communication in ambulances did occur, it was not until the 1950s that the use of radio dispatch became widespread in the United States and Canada. Indeed, during the 1950s the presence of radio dispatch was often treated as marketing inducement, and was prominently displayed on the sides of ambulances, along with other technological advances, such as carrying oxygen . Dispatch methodology was often determined by the business arrangements of the ambulance company. If the ambulance were under contract to the town, it might be dispatched as an 'add-on' to the fire department or police department resources. In some cases, it might be under contract to the local hospital, and dispatched from there. In many cases, small independent ambulance companies were simply dispatched by a family member or employee, employed part-time in many cases. Ambulance dispatchers required little in the way of qualifications, apart from good telephone manners and a knowledge of the local geography. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_medical_technician An emergency medical technician ( EMT ), also known as an ambulance technician , is a health professional that provides emergency medical services . [1] [2] EMTs are most commonly found working in ambulances . In English-speaking countries, paramedics are a separate profession that has additional educational requirements, qualifications, and scope of practice. [3] [4] EMTs are often employed by private ambulance services, municipal EMS agencies, governments , hospitals , and fire departments . Some EMTs are paid employees, while others (particularly those in rural areas ) are volunteers . [2] EMTs provide medical care under a set of protocols, which are typically written by a physician . [5] [6] EMTs are exposed to a variety of hazards such as lifting patients and equipment, treating those with infectious disease, handling hazardous substances, and transportation via ground or air vehicles. Employers can prevent occupational illness or injury by providing safe patient handling equipment, implementing a training program to educate EMTs on job hazards, and supplying PPE such as respirators, gloves, and isolation gowns when dealing with biological hazards. [7] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic An epidemic (from Greek ἐπί epi "upon or above" and δῆμος demos "people") is the rapid spread of disease to a large number of people in a given population within a short period of time. For example, in meningococcal infections , an attack rate in excess of 15 cases per 100,000 people for two consecutive weeks is considered an epidemic. [1] [2] Epidemics of infectious disease are generally caused by several factors including a change in the ecology of the host population (e.g., increased stress or increase in the density of a vector species), a genetic change in the pathogen reservoir or the introduction of an emerging patholow that found in the endemic equilibrium and the transmission threshold is exceeded. [3] An epidemic may be restricted to one location; however, if it spreads to other countries or continents and affects a substantial number of people, it may be termed a pandemic . [1] The declaration of an epidemic usually requires a good understanding of a baseline rate of incidence ; epidemics for certain diseases, such as influenza , are defined as reaching some defined increase in incidence above this baseline. [2] A few cases of a very rare disease may be classified as an epidemic, while many cases of a common disease (such as the common cold ) would not. An epidemic can cause enormous damage through financial and economic losses in addition to impaired health and loss of life. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eradication_of_infectious_diseases  Eradication is the reduction of an infectious disease 's prevalence in the global host population to zero. [1] It is sometimes confused with elimination, which describes either the reduction of an infectious disease's prevalence in a regional population to zero or the reduction of the global prevalence to a negligible amount. Further confusion arises from the use of the term eradication to refer to the total removal of a given pathogen from an individual (also known as clearance of an infection ), particularly in the context of HIV and certain other viruses where such cures are sought. The selection of infectious diseases for eradication is based on rigorous criteria, as both biological and technical features determine whether a pathogenic organism is (at least potentially) eradicable. The targeted organism must not have a non-human reservoir (or, in the case of animal diseases, the infection reservoir must be an easily identifiable species, as in the case of rinderpest ), and/or amplify in the environment. This implies that sufficient information on the life cycle and transmission dynamics is available at the time an eradication initiative is programmed. An efficient and practical intervention (such as a vaccine or antibiotic) must be available to interrupt transmission of the infective agent. Studies of measles in the pre-vaccination era led to the concept of the critical community size , the size of the population below which a pathogen ceases to circulate. [2] The use of vaccination programs before the introduction of an eradication campaign can reduce the susceptible population. The disease to be eradicated should be clearly identifiable, and an accurate diagnostic tool should exist. Economic considerations, as well as societal and political support and commitment, are other crucial factors that determine eradication feasibility. [3] [4] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erotomania Erotomania is listed in the DSM-5 as a subtype of a delusional disorder . [1] It is a relatively uncommon paranoid condition that is characterized by an individual's delusions of another person being infatuated with them. [2] This disorder is most often seen (though not exclusively) in female patients who are shy, dependent and sexually inexperienced. The object of the delusion is typically a male who is unattainable due to high social or financial status, marriage or disinterest. [2] [3] The object of obsession may also be imaginary, deceased or someone the patient has never met. Delusions of reference are common, as the erotomanic individual often perceives that they are being sent messages from the secret admirer through innocuous events such as seeing license plates from specific states, but has no research development proof. [3] Commonly, the onset of erotomania is sudden, and the course is chronic. [3] Erotomania is more common in women, but men are more likely to exhibit violent and stalker -like behaviors. [3] The core symptom of the disorder is that the sufferer holds an unshakable belief that another person is secretly in love with them. In some cases, the sufferer may believe several people at once are "secret admirers". Most commonly, the individual has delusions of being loved by an unattainable person who is usually an acquaintance or someone the person has never met. The sufferer may also experience other types of delusions concurrently with erotomania, such as delusions of reference, wherein the perceived admirer secretly communicates their love by subtle methods such as body posture, arrangement of household objects, colors, license plates on cars from specific states, and other seemingly innocuous acts (or, if the person is a public figure, through clues in the media). Some delusions may be extreme such as the conception, birth, and kidnapping of children that never existed. The delusional objects may be replaced by others over time, and some may be chronic in fixed forms. [3] Denial is characteristic with this disorder as the patients do not accept the fact that their object of delusion may be married, unavailable, or uninterested. The phantom lover may also be imaginary or deceased. Erotomania has two forms: primary and secondary. Primary erotomania is also commonly referred to as de Clerambault's syndrome and Old Maid's Insanity [4] and it exists alone without comorbidities , has a sudden onset and a chronic outcome. [3] The secondary form is found along with mental disorders like paranoid schizophrenia, often includes persecutory delusions , hallucinations , and grandiose ideas, and has a more gradual onset. [3] Patients with a "fixed" condition are more seriously ill with constant delusions and are less responsive to treatment. These individuals are usually timid, dependent women that are often sexually inexperienced. [3] In those with a more mild, recurrent condition, delusions are shorter-lived and the disorder can exist undetected by others for years. [4] Problematic behaviors include actions like calling, sending letters and gifts, making unannounced house visits and other persistent stalking behaviors. [3] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escitalopram Escitalopram , sold under the brand names Cipralex and Lexapro , among others, is an antidepressant of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) class. [2] Escitalopram is mainly used to treat major depressive disorder or generalized anxiety disorder . [2] It is taken by mouth. [2] Common side effects include trouble sleeping, nausea, sexual problems , and feeling tired. [2] More serious side effects may include suicide in people under the age of 25. [2] It is unclear if use during pregnancy or breastfeeding is safe. [3] Escitalopram is the ( S )- stereoisomer (left-handed version) of citalopram (which exists as a racemate ), hence the name es citalopram. [2] In other words, escitalopram is a chiral switch of citalopram. Escitalopram was approved for medical use in the United States in 2002. [2] Escitalopram is sometimes replaced by twice the dose of citalopram. [4] In 2018, it was the 22nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States with more than 25 million prescriptions. [5] [6] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excessive_Daytime_Sleepiness Excessive daytime sleepiness is characterized by persistent sleepiness and often a general lack of energy, even during the day after apparently adequate or even prolonged nighttime sleep. EDS can be considered as a broad condition encompassing several sleep disorders where increased sleep is a symptom, or as a symptom of another underlying disorder like narcolepsy , circadian rhythm sleep disorder , sleep apnea or idiopathic hypersomnia . Some persons with EDS, including those with hypersomnias like narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia , are compelled to nap repeatedly during the day; fighting off increasingly strong urges to sleep during inappropriate times such as while driving, while at work, during a meal, or in conversations. As the compulsion to sleep intensifies, the ability to complete tasks sharply diminishes, often mimicking the appearance of intoxication. During occasional unique and/or stimulating circumstances, a person with EDS can sometimes remain animated, awake and alert, for brief or extended periods of time.  EDS can affect the ability to function in family, social, occupational, or other settings. A proper diagnosis of the underlying cause and ultimately treatment of symptoms and/or the underlying cause can help mitigate such complications. [1] EDS can be a symptom of a number of factors and disorders. Specialists in sleep medicine are trained to diagnose them. Some are: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extrapyramidal_symptom Extrapyramidal symptoms ( EPS ), also known as extrapyramidal side effects ( EPSE ) are drug-induced movement disorders, which include acute and long-term symptoms. These symptoms include dystonia (continuous spasms and muscle contractions), akathisia (may manifest as motor restlessness), [1] parkinsonism characteristic symptoms such as rigidity , bradykinesia (slowness of movement), tremor , and tardive dyskinesia (irregular, jerky movements). [2] Extrapyramidal symptoms are a reason why subjects drop out of clinical trials of antipsychotics; of the 213 (14.6%) subjects that dropped out of one of the largest clinical trials of antipsychotics (the CATIE trial (Clinical Antipsychotic Trials for Intervention Effectiveness), which included 1460 randomized subjects), 58 (27.2%) of those discontinuations were due to EPS. [3] Extrapyramidal symptoms are most commonly caused by typical antipsychotic drugs that antagonize dopamine D2 receptors. [2] The most common typical antipsychotics associated with EPS are haloperidol and fluphenazine . [4] Atypical antipsychotics have lower D2 receptor affinity or higher serotonin 5-HT2A receptor affinity which lead to lower rates of EPS. [5] Other anti-dopaminergic drugs, like the antiemetic metoclopramide , can also result in extrapyramidal side effects. [6] Short and long-term use of antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI), and norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitors (NDRI) have also resulted in EPS. [7] Specifically, duloxetine , sertraline , escitalopram , fluoxetine , and bupropion have been linked to the induction of EPS. [7] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_drop Eye drops or eyedrops are saline -containing drops used as an ocular route to administer . Depending on the condition being treated, they may contain steroids , antihistamines , sympathomimetics , beta receptor blockers , parasympathomimetics , parasympatholytics , prostaglandins , nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antibiotics , antifungals , or topical anesthetics . Eye drops sometimes do not have medications in them and are only lubricating and tear -replacing solutions. Eye drops have less of a risk of side effects than do oral medicines, and such risk can be minimized by occluding the lacrimal punctum (i.e. pressing on the inner corner of the eye) for a short while after instilling drops. Eye drops are also used for stopping itching and redness of the eyes. Prior to the development of single-use pre-loaded sterile plastic applicators, eye drops were administered using an eye dropper , a glass pipette with a rubber bulb. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_Movement_Desensitization_and_Reprocessing Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing ( EMDR ) is a form of psychotherapy developed by Francine Shapiro starting in 1988 in which the person being treated is asked to recall distressing images; the therapist then directs the patient in one type of bilateral stimulation, such as side-to-side eye rapid movement  or hand tapping. [1] According to the 2013 World Health Organization practice guideline: "This therapy [EMDR] is based on the idea that negative thoughts, feelings and behaviours are the result of unprocessed memories. The treatment involves standardized procedures that include focusing simultaneously on (a) spontaneous associations of traumatic images, thoughts, emotions and bodily sensations and (b) bilateral stimulation that is most commonly in the form of repeated eye movements." [2] EMDR is included in several evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), with varying levels of recommendation and evidence (very low to moderate per WHO stress guidelines). [3] [2] [4] As of 2020, the American Psychological Association lists EMDR as an evidence-based treatment for PTSD [5] but stresses that "the available evidence can be interpreted in several ways" and notes there is debate about the precise mechanism by which EMDR appears to relieve PTSD symptoms with some evidence EMDR may simply be a variety of exposure therapy . [6] EMDR therapy was first developed by Francine Shapiro upon noticing that certain eye movements reduced the intensity of a disturbing thought. She then conducted a scientific study with trauma victims in 1988 and the research was published in the Journal of Traumatic Stress in 1989. [7] Her hypothesis was that when a traumatic or distressing experience occurs, it may overwhelm normal coping mechanisms , with the memory and associated stimuli being inadequately processed and stored in an isolated memory network. [8] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_(medicine) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_history_(medicine) In medicine , a family history ( FH or FHx ) consists of information about disorders from which the direct blood relatives of the patient have suffered. [1] Genealogy typically includes very little of the medical history of the family , but the medical history could be considered a specific subset of the total history of a family. [ citation needed ] Accurate knowledge of a patient's family history may identify a predisposition to developing certain illnesses, which can inform clinical decisions and allow effective management or even prevention of conditions. [2] [3] Early mentions of family medical histories in medical literature date from the 1840s. Henry Ancell mentioned inquiring about the family history of a patient in a medical case study in 1842, noting that the patient's presenting concern appears to be present in relatives and remarking on the prolific reproduction of her female relatives. [4] In 1849, W.H. Walshe argued in a lecture at University College Hospital that in addition to a history of the presenting disease itself, a physician should also collect family history. [5] Walshe's lecture does not define or justify the family history, which may suggest that taking one was already in common practice. However, later 19th-century physicians did provide a specific apologia for family histories and in some cases explicitly noted that they were not yet being taken routinely. James Begbie argued that understanding the health of the entire family, including cousins, can help predict otherwise unpredictable illnesses that run in the family. [6] Begbie's use of the family history for both predictive and normative evaluation of the family anticipated Francis Galton , who championed the routine family history as a eugenic strategy in his 1883 text, Inquiries into Human Faculty and Its Development . Galton writes: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_liver_disease Fatty liver disease ( FLD ), also known as hepatic steatosis , is a condition where excess fat builds up in the liver . [1] Often there are no or few symptoms. [1] [2] Occasionally there may be tiredness or pain in the upper right side of the abdomen . [1] Complications may include cirrhosis , liver cancer , and esophageal varices . [1] [3] There are two types of fatty liver disease: non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and alcoholic liver disease . [1] NAFLD is made up of simple fatty liver and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). [5] [1] The primary risks include alcohol , type 2 diabetes , and obesity . [1] [3] Other risk factors include certain medications such as glucocorticoids , and hepatitis C . [1] It is unclear why some people with NAFLD develop simple fatty liver and others develop NASH. [1] Diagnosis is based on the medical history supported by blood tests, medical imaging , and occasionally liver biopsy . [1] It is recommended that people with fatty liver disease do not drink alcohol. [3] [2] Treatment of NAFLD is generally otherwise by dietary changes and exercise to bring about weight loss . [1] In those who are severely affected, liver transplantation may be an option. [1] More than 90% of all heavy drinkers develop fatty liver while about 25% develop the more severe alcoholic hepatitis . [4] NAFLD affects about 30% of people in Western countries and 10% of people in Asia. [2] NAFLD affects about 10% of children in the United States. [1] It occurs more often in older people and males. [3] [5] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female_genital_mutilation   Female genital mutilation ( FGM ), also known as female genital cutting and female circumcision , [a] is the ritual cutting or removal of some or all of the external female genitalia . The practice is found in Africa, Asia and the Middle East, and within communities from countries in which FGM is common. UNICEF estimated in 2016 that 200 million women living today in 30 countries—27 African countries, Indonesia, Iraqi Kurdistan and Yemen—have undergone the procedures. [3] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetal_viability Fetal viability or foetal viability is the ability of a fetus to survive outside the uterus . [1] Viability , as the word has been used in United States constitutional law since Roe v. Wade , is the potential of the fetus to survive outside the uterus after birth, natural or induced, when supported by up-to-date medicine. Fetal viability depends largely on the fetal organ maturity, and environmental conditions. [2] According to Websters Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary of the English Language, viability of a fetus means having reached such a stage of development as to be capable of living, under normal conditions, outside the uterus. Viability exists as a function of biomedical and technological capacities, which are different in different parts of the world. As a consequence, there is, at the present time, no worldwide, uniform gestational age that defines viability. [3] According to the McGraw-Hill medical dictionary a nonviable fetus is "an expelled or delivered fetus which, although living, cannot possibly survive to the point of sustaining life independently, even with support of the best available medical therapy." [4] A legal definition states: "Nonviable means not capable of living, growing, or developing and functioning successfully. It is antithesis of viable, which is defined as having attained such form and development of organs as to be normally capable of living outside the uterus." [Wolfe v. Isbell, 291 Ala. 327, 329 (Ala. 1973)] [5] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetoscopy Fetoscopy is an endoscopic procedure during pregnancy to allow surgical access to the fetus , the amniotic cavity , the umbilical cord , and the fetal side of the placenta . A small (3–4 mm) incision is made in the abdomen , and an endoscope is inserted through the abdominal wall and uterus into the amniotic cavity. Fetoscopy allows for medical interventions such as a biopsy (tissue sample) or a laser occlusion of abnormal blood vessels (such as chorioangioma ) or the treatment of spina bifida . [1] Fetoscopy is usually performed in the second or third trimester of pregnancy. The procedure can place the fetus at increased risk of adverse outcomes, including fetal loss or preterm delivery, so the risks and benefits must be carefully weighed in order to protect the health of the mother and fetus(es). The procedure is typically performed in an operating room by an obstetrician-gynecologist . In 1945, Björn Westin published a study which documented his use of a panendoscope to directly observe embryos. [2] In 1966, Agüero et al published a study which used hysteroscopy to observe various features of the fetus, cervix, and uterus. [2] In 1972, Carlo Valenti of the SUNY Downstate Medical Center recorded a technique which he called "endoamnioscopy", which allowed for direct visualization of the developing fetus. [3] Gallinat made the first attempt to standardize these techniques in 1978. [2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_aid_kit A first aid kit is a collection of supplies and equipment that is used to give medical treatment. There is a wide variation in the contents of first aid kits based on the knowledge and experience of those putting it together, the differing first aid requirements of the area where it may be used and variations in legislation or regulation in a given area. The international standard for first aid kits is that they should be identified with the ISO graphical symbol for first aid (from ISO 7010 ) which is an equal white cross on a green background. [1] First aid kits can be assembled in almost any type of container, and this will depend on whether they are commercially produced or assembled by an individual.  Standard kits often come in durable plastic boxes, fabric pouches or in wall mounted cabinets.  The type of container will vary depending on the purpose, and they range in size from wallet-sized through to a large box. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_feet Flat feet (also called pes planus or fallen arches ) is a postural deformity in which the arches of the foot collapse, with the entire sole of the foot coming into complete or near-complete contact with the ground. There is a functional relationship between the structure of the arch of the foot and the biomechanics of the lower leg. The arch provides an elastic, springy connection between the forefoot and the hind foot so that a majority of the forces incurred during weight bearing on the foot can be dissipated before the force reaches the long bones of the leg and thigh. [1] In pes planus, the head of the talus bone is displaced medially and distal from the navicular bone . As a result, the Plantar calcaneonavicular ligament (spring ligament) and the tendon of the tibialis posterior muscle are stretched to the extent that the individual with pes planus loses the function of the medial longitudinal arch (MLA). If the MLA is absent or nonfunctional in both the seated and standing positions, the individual has “rigid” flatfoot. If the MLA is present and functional while the individual is sitting or standing up on their toes, but this arch disappears when assuming a foot-flat stance, the individual has “supple” flatfoot. This latter condition is often treated with arch supports. [1] However, a recent randomized controlled trial found no evidence for the efficacy of treatment of flat feet in children either from expensive prescribed orthotics (i.e., shoe inserts) or less expensive over-the-counter orthotics. [2] Three studies (see citations below in Military performance section ) of military recruits have shown no evidence of increased injury, or foot problems, due to flat feet, in a population of people who reach military service age without prior foot problems. However, these studies cannot be used to judge possible future damage from this condition when diagnosed at younger ages. They also cannot be applied to persons whose flat feet are associated with foot symptoms, or certain symptoms in other parts of the body (such as the leg or back) possibly referable to the foot. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluoxetine  Fluoxetine , sold under the brand names Prozac and Sarafem among others, is an antidepressant of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) class. [2] It is used for the treatment of major depressive disorder , obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), bulimia nervosa , panic disorder , and premenstrual dysphoric disorder . [2] It is also approved for treatment of major depressive disorder in adolescents and children 8 years of age and over. [6] It has also been used to treat premature ejaculation . [2] Fluoxetine is taken by mouth . [2] Common side effects include indigestion, trouble sleeping, sexual dysfunction, loss of appetite, dry mouth, and  rash. Serious side effects include serotonin syndrome , mania , seizures , an increased risk of suicidal behavior in people under 25 years old, and an increased risk of bleeding. [2] Discontinuation syndrome is less likely to occur with fluoxetine than with other antidepressants, but it still happens in many cases. Fluoxetine taken during pregnancy is associated with significant increase in congenital heart defects in the newborns. [7] [8] It has been suggested that fluoxetine therapy may be continued during breastfeeding if it was used during pregnancy or if other antidepressants were ineffective. [9] Its mechanism of action is unknown, but some hypothesize that it is related to serotonin activity in the brain. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foch_Hospital Foch Hospital ( French : Hôpital Foch ) is a celebrated teaching hospital in the Suresnes , France . Part of the Établissement de santé privé d'intérêt collectif and a teaching hospital of Versailles Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines University , [1] it is one of Europe's largest hospitals. It was established in 1929 with the help of Consuelo Vanderbilt [2] and Winnaretta Singer . It was named in honour of Ferdinand Foch . Through its history, the Foch Hospital hosted notable doctors, among others: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontotemporal_dementia Frontotemporal dementia ( FTD ), or frontotemporal degeneration disease , [1] or frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder , [2] encompasses several types of dementia involving the frontal and temporal lobes . [3] FTDs are broadly presented as behavioral or language disorders. [4] The three main subtypes or variant syndromes are a behavioral variant (bvFTD) previously known as Pick's disease , [5] [6] and two variants of primary progressive aphasia – semantic variant (svPPA), and nonfluent variant (nfvPPA). [4] [6] Two rare distinct subtypes of FTD are neuronal intermediate filament inclusion disease (NIFID), and basophilic inclusion body disease.  Other related disorders include corticobasal syndrome and FTD  with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) FTD-ALS also called FTD- MND . [7] Frontotemporal dementias are mostly early-onset syndromes that are linked to frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), [8] which is characterized by progressive neuronal loss predominantly involving the frontal or temporal lobes , and a typical loss of over 70% of spindle neurons , while other neuron types remain intact. [9] FTD was first described by Arnold Pick in 1892 and was originally called Pick's disease , a term now reserved only for behavioral variant FTD which shows the presence of Pick bodies and Pick cells. [10] [5] [11] Second only to Alzheimer's disease (AD) in prevalence , FTD accounts for 20% of early-onset dementia cases. [7] Signs and symptoms typically manifest in late adulthood, more commonly between the ages of 45 and 65, approximately equally affecting men and women. [12] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugue_state Dissociative fugue , formerly fugue state or psychogenic fugue , is a dissociative disorder [1] and a rare psychiatric disorder characterized by reversible amnesia for personal identity, including the memories , personality , and other identifying characteristics of individuality . The state can last days, months or longer. Dissociative fugue usually involves unplanned travel or wandering and is sometimes accompanied by the establishment of a new identity. It is a facet of dissociative amnesia , according to the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( DSM-5 ). After recovery from a fugue state, previous memories usually return intact, and further treatment is unnecessary. Additionally, an episode of fugue is not characterized as attributable to a psychiatric disorder if it can be related to the ingestion of psychotropic substances, to physical trauma, to a general medical condition, or to dissociative identity disorder , [ clarification needed ] delirium , or dementia . [2] Fugues are precipitated by a series of long-term traumatic episodes. It is most commonly associated with childhood victims of sexual abuse who learn over time to dissociate memory of the abuse (dissociative amnesia). Symptoms of a dissociative fugue include mild confusion and once the fugue ends, possible depression , grief, shame, and discomfort. People have also experienced a post-fugue anger . [3] Another symptom of the fugue state can consist of loss of one's identity. [4] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_magnetic_resonance_imaging Functional magnetic resonance imaging or functional MRI ( fMRI ) measures brain activity by detecting changes associated with blood flow . [1] [2] This technique relies on the fact that cerebral blood flow and neuronal activation are coupled. When an area of the brain is in use, blood flow to that region also increases. [3] The primary form of fMRI uses the blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) contrast, [4] discovered by Seiji Ogawa in 1990. This is a type of specialized brain and body scan used to map neural activity in the brain or spinal cord of humans or other animals by imaging the change in blood flow ( hemodynamic response ) related to energy use by brain cells. [4] Since the early 1990s, fMRI has come to dominate brain mapping research because it does not require people to undergo injections or surgery, to ingest substances, or to be exposed to ionizing radiation. [5] This measure is frequently corrupted by noise from various sources; hence, statistical procedures are used to extract the underlying signal.  The resulting brain activation can be graphically represented by color-coding the strength of activation across the brain or the specific region studied.  The technique can localize activity to within millimeters but, using standard techniques, no better than within a window of a few seconds. [6] Other methods of obtaining contrast are arterial spin labeling [7] and diffusion MRI . The latter procedure is similar to BOLD fMRI but provides contrast based on the magnitude of diffusion of water molecules in the brain. In addition to detecting BOLD responses from activity due to tasks/stimuli, fMRI can measure resting state fMRI , or taskless fMRI, which shows the subjects' baseline BOLD variance.  Since about 1998 studies have shown the existence and properties of the default mode network (DMN), aka 'Resting State Network' (RSN), a functionally connected neural network of apparent 'brain states'. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gam-COVID-Vac  2020 2021 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganglioglioma Ganglioglioma is a rare, slow-growing primary central nervous system (CNS) tumor which most frequently occurs in the temporal lobes of children and young adults. [2] Gangliogliomas are generally benign WHO grade I tumors ; the presence of anaplastic changes in the glial component is considered to represent WHO grade III (anaplastic ganglioglioma). Criteria for WHO grade II have been suggested, but are not established. Malignant transformation of spinal ganglioglioma has been seen in only a select few cases.  Poor prognostic factors for adults with gangliogliomas include older age at diagnosis, male sex, and malignant histologic features. Histologically, ganglioglioma is composed of both neoplastic glial and ganglion cells which are disorganized, variably cellular, and non-infiltrative. Occasionally, it may be challenging to differentiate ganglion cell tumors from an infiltrating glioma with entrapped neurons. The presence of neoplastic ganglion cells forming abnormal clusters , the presence of binucleation and dysmorphic neurons are helpful clues favoring ganglioglioma over glioma. The glial component of ganglioglioma includes fibrillary astrocytes with varying degrees of cellular atypia . The neoplastic neuronal components are often clustered or irregularly oriented. Fibrovascular stroma confined to the neuronal component, perivascular lymphocytic infiltrates, and small foci of calcification are common, as is immunopositivity for synaptophysin , neuron-specific enolase, and chromogranin A . Elevated Ki-67 and p53 labeling index is associated with more aggressive tumor behavior in both children and adults with gangliogliomas. The rare occurrence of malignant transformation is confined to the glial cell population, and is characterized by increased cellularity and mitotic activity , endothelial proliferation, and necrosis. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastric_bypass_surgery  Gastric bypass surgery refers to a technique in which the stomach is divided into a small upper pouch and a much larger lower "remnant" pouch and then the small intestine is rearranged to connect to both. Surgeons have developed several different ways to reconnect the intestine, thus leading to several different gastric bypass procedures (GBP). Any GBP leads to a marked reduction in the functional volume of the stomach, accompanied by an altered physiological and physical response to food. The operation is prescribed to treat morbid obesity (defined as a body mass index greater than 40), type 2 diabetes , hypertension , sleep apnea , and other comorbid conditions. Bariatric surgery is the term encompassing all of the surgical treatments for morbid obesity, not just gastric bypasses, which make up only one class of such operations. The resulting weight loss, typically dramatic, markedly reduces comorbidities. The long-term mortality rate of gastric bypass patients has been shown to be reduced by up to 40%. [journal 1] [journal 2] As with all surgery, complications may occur.  A study from 2005 to 2006 revealed that 15% of patients experience complications as a result of gastric bypass, and 0.5% of patients died within six months of surgery due to complications. [press release 1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroenterology Gastroenterology [1] is the branch of medicine focused on the digestive system and its disorders. Diseases affecting the gastrointestinal tract , which include the organs from mouth into anus , along the alimentary canal , are the focus of this speciality. Physicians practicing in this field are called gastroenterologists . They have usually completed about eight years of pre-medical and medical education , a year-long internship (if this is not a part of the residency), three years of an internal medicine residency, and three years in the gastroenterology fellowship . Gastroenterologists perform a number of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures including colonoscopy , esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), and liver biopsy . [2] Some gastroenterology trainees will complete a "fourth-year" (although this is often their seventh year of graduate medical education) in transplant hepatology , advanced interventional endoscopy , inflammatory bowel disease , motility , or other topics. Advanced endoscopy, sometimes called interventional or surgical endoscopy, is a sub-specialty of gastroenterology that focuses on advanced endoscopic techniques for the treatment of pancreatic , hepatobiliary , and gastrointestinal disease . Interventional gastroenterologists typically undergo an additional year of rigorous training in advanced endoscopic techniques including endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, endoscopic ultrasound-guided diagnostic and interventional procedures, and advanced resection techniques including endoscopic mucosal resection and endoscopic submucosal dissection . Additionally, the performance of endoscopic bariatric procedures is also performed by some advanced endoscopists. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_bleeding Gastrointestinal bleeding ( GI bleed ), also called gastrointestinal hemorrhage ( GIB ), is all forms of bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract , from the mouth to the rectum . [9] When there is significant blood loss over a short time, symptoms may include vomiting red blood , vomiting black blood , bloody stool , or black stool . [1] Small amounts of bleeding over a long time may cause iron-deficiency anemia resulting in feeling tired or heart-related chest pain . [1] Other symptoms may include abdominal pain , shortness of breath , pale skin , or passing out . [1] [9] Sometimes in those with small amounts of bleeding no symptoms may be present. [1] Bleeding is typically divided into two main types: upper gastrointestinal bleeding and lower gastrointestinal bleeding . [2] Causes of upper GI bleeds include: peptic ulcer disease, esophageal varices due to liver cirrhosis and cancer , among others. [3] Causes of lower GI bleeds include: hemorrhoids , cancer, and inflammatory bowel disease among others. [2] Diagnosis typically begins with a medical history and physical examination , along with blood tests. [1] Small amounts of bleeding may be detected by fecal occult blood test. [1] Endoscopy of the lower and upper gastrointestinal tract may locate the area of bleeding. [1] Medical imaging may be useful in cases that are not clear. [1] Initial treatment focuses on resuscitation which may include intravenous fluids and blood transfusions . [4] Often blood transfusions are not recommended unless the hemoglobin is less than 70 or 80 g/L. [7] [10] Treatment with proton pump inhibitors , octreotide , and antibiotics may be considered in certain cases. [5] [6] [11] If other measures are not effective, an esophageal balloon may be attempted in those with presumed esophageal varices. [2] Endoscopy of the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum or endoscopy of the large bowel are generally recommended within 24 hours and may allow treatment as well as diagnosis. [4] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_cancer Gastrointestinal cancer refers to malignant conditions of the gastrointestinal tract (GI tract) and accessory organs of digestion , including the esophagus, stomach, biliary system, pancreas, small intestine, large intestine, rectum and anus. The symptoms relate to the organ affected and can include obstruction (leading to difficulty swallowing or defecating), abnormal bleeding or other associated problems. The diagnosis often requires endoscopy , followed by biopsy of suspicious tissue. The treatment depends on the location of the tumor, as well as the type of cancer cell and whether it has invaded other tissues or spread elsewhere. These factors also determine the prognosis. Overall, the GI tract and the accessory organs of digestion (pancreas, liver, gall bladder) are responsible for more cancers and more deaths from cancer than any other system in the body. [1] [2] There is significant geographic variation in the rates of different gastrointestinal cancers. [1] Esophageal cancer is the sixth-most-common cancer in the world, and its incidence is increasing. [4] Some three to five males are affected for each female. [4] An "esophageal cancer belt", in which the incidence of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is more than a hundred times that of adjacent areas, extends from northeastern China through central Asia to northern Iran. [1] Ethiopia also has a notably high incidence. [4] There are two main types of esophageal cancer—adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. Worldwide, the incidence of each type is about the same, but in developed countries like North America and Europe adenocarcinoma is the more common. [4] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine  Medicine is the science [1] and practice [2] of caring for a patient and managing the diagnosis , prognosis , prevention , treatment or palliation of their injury or disease . Medicine encompasses a variety of health care practices evolved to maintain and restore health by the prevention and treatment of illness . Contemporary medicine applies biomedical sciences , biomedical research , genetics , and medical technology to diagnose , treat, and prevent injury and disease, typically through pharmaceuticals or surgery , but also through therapies as diverse as psychotherapy , external splints and traction , medical devices , biologics , and ionizing radiation , amongst others. [3] Medicine has been practiced since prehistoric times , during most of which it was an art (an area of skill and knowledge) frequently having connections to the religious and philosophical beliefs of local culture. For example, a medicine man would apply herbs and say prayers for healing, or an ancient philosopher and physician would apply bloodletting according to the theories of humorism . In recent centuries, since the advent of modern science , most medicine has become a combination of art and science (both basic and applied , under the umbrella of medical science ). While stitching technique for sutures is an art learned through practice, the knowledge of what happens at the cellular and molecular level in the tissues being stitched arises through science. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health  Health is a state of physical, mental and social well-being in which disease and infirmity are absent. [1] The meaning of health has evolved over time. In keeping with the biomedical perspective, early definitions of health focused on the theme of the body's ability to function; health was seen as a state of normal function that could be disrupted from time to time by disease . An example of such a definition of health is: "a state characterized by anatomic, physiologic, and psychological integrity; ability to perform personally valued family, work, and community roles; ability to deal with physical , biological , psychological , and social stress ". [2] Then in 1948, in a radical departure from previous definitions, the World Health Organization (WHO) proposed a definition that aimed higher: linking health to well-being , in terms of "physical, mental, and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease and infirmity". [3] Although this definition was welcomed by some as being innovative, it was also criticized as being vague, excessively broad and was not construed as measurable. For a long time, it was set aside as an impractical ideal and most discussions of health returned to the practicality of the biomedical model. [4] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease  A disease is a particular abnormal condition that negatively affects the structure or function of all or part of an organism, and that is not due to any immediate external injury. [1] [2] Diseases are often known to be medical conditions that are associated with specific signs and symptoms . A disease may be caused by external factors such as pathogens or by internal dysfunctions.  For example, internal dysfunctions of the immune system can produce a variety of different diseases, including various forms of immunodeficiency , hypersensitivity , allergies and autoimmune disorders . In humans, disease is often used more broadly to refer to any condition that causes pain , dysfunction , distress , social problems , or death to the person afflicted, or similar problems for those in contact with the person. In this broader sense, it sometimes includes injuries , disabilities , disorders , syndromes , infections , isolated symptoms , deviant behaviors , and atypical variations of structure and function, while in other contexts and for other purposes these may be considered distinguishable categories. Diseases can affect people not only physically, but also mentally, as contracting and living with a disease can alter the affected person's perspective on life. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine  Medicine is the science [1] and practice [2] of caring for a patient and managing the diagnosis , prognosis , prevention , treatment or palliation of their injury or disease .

The company was founded by Chicago physician Wallace Calvin Abbott in 1888 to formulate known drugs; today, it sells medical devices, diagnostics, branded generic medicines and nutritional products. It split off its research-based pharmaceuticals business into AbbVie in 2013. Among its well-known products across the medical devices, diagnostics, and nutrition product divisions are Pedialyte , Similac , Ensure , Glucerna , ZonePerfect , FreeStyle Libre, i-STAT and MitraClip . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abenomask https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine) In medicine , describing a disease as acute denotes that it is of short duration and, as a corollary of that, of recent onset . The quantification of how much time constitutes "short" and "recent" varies by disease and by context, but the core denotation of "acute" is always qualitatively in contrast with " chronic ", which denotes long-lasting disease (for example, in acute leukaemia and chronic leukaemia ). In addition, "acute" also often connotes two other meanings: sudden onset and severity , such as in acute myocardial infarction (AMI), where suddenness and severity are both established aspects of the meaning. It thus often connotes that the condition is fulminant (as in the AMI example), but not always (as in acute rhinitis , which is usually synonymous with the common cold ). The one thing that acute MI and acute rhinitis have in common is that they are not chronic. They can happen again (as in recurrent pneumonia , that is, multiple acute pneumonia episodes), but they are not the same case ongoing for months or years (unlike chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , which is). A noncount sense of "acute disease" refers to the acute phase, that is, a short course, of any disease entity. [1] [2] For example, in an article on ulcerative enteritis in poultry , the author says, "in acute disease there may be increased mortality without any obvious signs ", [3] referring to the acute form or phase of ulcerative enteritis. Not all acute diseases or injuries are severe, and vice versa. For example, a mild stubbed toe is an acute injury. Similarly, many acute upper respiratory infections and acute gastroenteritis cases in adults are mild and usually resolve within a few days or weeks. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect_(medicine) An adverse effect is an undesired harmful effect resulting from a medication or other intervention , such as surgery . [1] An adverse effect may be termed a " side effect ", when judged to be secondary to a main or therapeutic effect . If it results from an unsuitable or incorrect dosage or procedure, this is called a medical error and not a complication . Adverse effects are sometimes referred to as " iatrogenic " because they are generated by a physician /treatment. Some adverse effects occur only when starting, increasing or discontinuing a treatment. Adverse effects can also be caused by placebo treatments (in which case the adverse effects are referred to as nocebo effects). [2] [3] Using a drug or other medical intervention which is contraindicated may increase the risk of adverse effects. Adverse effects may cause complications of a disease or procedure and negatively affect its prognosis . They may also lead to non-compliance with a treatment regimen. Adverse effects of medical treatment resulted in 142,000 deaths in 2013 up from 94,000 deaths in 1990 globally. [4] The harmful outcome is usually indicated by some result such as morbidity , mortality , alteration in body weight , levels of enzymes , loss of function, or as a pathological change detected at the microscopic, macroscopic or physiological level. It may also be indicated by symptoms reported by a patient. Adverse effects may cause a reversible or irreversible change, including an increase or decrease in the susceptibility of the individual to other chemicals, foods , or procedures, such as drug interactions . In terms of drugs, adverse events may be defined as: “Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment.” [5] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiseptic Antiseptics (from Greek ἀντί anti , "against" [1] and σηπτικός sēptikos , "putrefactive" [2] ) are antimicrobial substances that are applied to living tissue / skin to reduce the possibility of infection , sepsis , or putrefaction . Antiseptics are generally distinguished from antibiotics by the latter's ability to safely destroy bacteria within the body, and from disinfectants , which destroy microorganisms found on non-living objects. [3] Some antiseptics are true germicides , capable of destroying microbes ( bacteriocidal ), while others are bacteriostatic and only prevent or inhibit their growth. [4] Antibacterials include antiseptics that have the proven ability to act against bacteria. Microbicides which destroy virus particles are called viricides or antivirals . Antifungals , also known as antimycotics , are pharmaceutical fungicides used to treat and prevent mycosis (fungal infection). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antivenom Antivenom , also known as antivenin , venom antiserum , and antivenom immunoglobulin , is a specific treatment for envenomation . It is composed of antibodies and used to treat certain venomous bites and stings. [1] Antivenoms are recommended only if there is significant toxicity or a high risk of toxicity. [1] The specific antivenom needed depends on the species involved. [1] It is given by injection. [1] Side effects may be severe. [1] They include serum sickness , shortness of breath , and allergic reactions including anaphylaxis . [1] Antivenom is traditionally made by collecting venom from the relevant animal and injecting small amounts of it into a domestic animal. [2] The antibodies that form are then collected from the domestic animal's blood and purified. [2] Versions are available for spider bites , snake bites , fish stings , and scorpion stings . [3] Due to the high cost of producing antibody-based antivenoms and their short shelf lives when not refrigerated, alternative methods of production of antivenoms are being actively explored. [4] One such different method of production involves production from bacteria. [5] Another approach is to develop targeted drugs (which, unlike antibodies, are usually synthetic and easier to manufacture at scale). [6] Antivenom was first developed in the late 19th century and came into common use in the 1950s. [2] [7] It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines . [8] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apgar_score The Apgar score is a method to quickly summarize the health of newborn children against infant mortality . [1] [2] Virginia Apgar , an anesthesiologist at New York–Presbyterian Hospital , developed the score in 1952 to quantify the effects of obstetric anesthesia on babies. [3] The Apgar score is determined by evaluating the newborn baby on five simple criteria on a scale from zero to two, then summing up the five values thus obtained. The resulting score ranges from zero to 10. [4] The five criteria are summarized using words chosen to form a backronym : appearance, pulse, grimace, activity, respiration. [5] The test is generally done at 1 and 5 minutes after birth and may be repeated later if the score is and remains low. Scores of 7 and above are generally normal; 4 to 6, fairly low; and 3 and below are generally regarded as critically low and cause for immediate resuscitative efforts. [6] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon_plasma_coagulation Argon plasma coagulation ( APC ) is a medical endoscopic procedure used to control bleeding from certain lesions in the gastrointestinal tract . It is administered during esophagogastroduodenoscopy or colonoscopy . APC involves the use of a jet of ionized argon gas ( plasma ) directed through a probe passed through the endoscope . The probe is placed at some distance from the bleeding lesion, and argon gas is emitted, then ionized by a high-voltage discharge (approx 6 kV ). [1] High-frequency electric current is then conducted through the jet of gas, resulting in coagulation of the bleeding lesion. As no physical contact is made with the lesion, the procedure is safe if the bowel has been cleaned of colonic gases, [2] [3] and can be used to treat bleeding in parts of the gastrointestinal tract with thin walls, such as the cecum . The depth of coagulation is usually only a few millimetres. APC is used to treat the following conditions: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asepsis Asepsis is the state of being free from disease-causing micro-organisms (such as pathogenic bacteria , viruses , pathogenic fungi , and parasites ). [1] There are two categories of asepsis: medical and surgical. [1] The modern day notion of asepsis is derived from the older antiseptic techniques, a shift initiated by different individuals in the 19th century who introduced practices such as the sterilizing of surgical tools and the wearing of surgical gloves during operations. [2] The goal of asepsis is to eliminate infection, not to achieve sterility. [1] Ideally, a surgical field is sterile , meaning it is free of all biological contaminants (e.g. fungi, bacteria, viruses), not just those that can cause disease, putrefaction , or fermentation . [1] Even in an aseptic state, a condition of sterile inflammation may develop. The term often refers to those practices used to promote or induce asepsis in an operative field of surgery or medicine to prevent infection . [3] The modern concept of asepsis evolved in the 19th century through multiple individuals. Ignaz Semmelweis showed that hand washing prior to delivery reduced puerperal fever . Despite this, many hospitals continued to practice surgery in unsanitary conditions, wit h some surgeons taking pride in their bloodstained operating gowns. [4] It was not until after reading of the findings by Louis Pasteur that Joseph Lister introduced the use of carbolic acid as an antiseptic, and in doing so, reduced surgical infection rates. [5] Lawson Tait shifted the movement then from antisepsis to asepsis, instilling practices such as a strict no-talking policy within his operating room and drastically limiting the number of people to come in contact with a patient's wound. [6] Ernst von Bergmann also introduced the autoclave , a device used for the practice of the sterilization of surgical instruments. [7] But, everything from operating room uniforms to gloves was pioneered by William Halsted . Preceding modern-day scrubs attire, Halsted implemented a no street clothes policy in his operating room, opting to wear a completely white, sterile uniform consisting of a duck suit , tennis shoes , and skullcap . [2] This helped to prevent the introduction of infections into open wounds. [2] Additionally, Halsted would sterilize the operation site with alcohol, iodine and other disinfectants and use drapes to cover all areas except for the site. [2] In his department at Johns Hopkins Hospital , he enforced an extreme hand washing ritual consisting of soaking in harmfully strong chemicals like permanganate and mercury bichloride solution as well as scrubbing with stiff brushes. [2] The damage to a surgical nurse's hands compelled him to create the earliest form of the surgical gloves with the Goodyear Rubber Company . [2] These gloves became a part of the aseptic surgery standard when Dr. Joseph Colt Bloodgood and several others began wearing them for that particular purpose. [8] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_reproduction_number  (wild type) In epidemiology , the basic reproduction number , or basic reproductive number (sometimes called basic reproduction ratio or basic reproductive rate ), denoted R 0 {\displaystyle R_{0}} (pronounced R nought or R zero ), [19] of an infection is the expected number of cases directly generated by one case in a population where all individuals are susceptible to infection. [15] The definition assumes that no other individuals are infected or immunized (naturally or through vaccination ). Some definitions, such as that of the Australian Department of Health , add the absence of "any deliberate intervention in disease transmission". [20] The basic reproduction number is not the same as the effective reproduction number R {\displaystyle R} (usually written R t {\displaystyle R_{t}} [ t for time], sometimes R e {\displaystyle R_{e}} ), [21] which is the number of cases generated in the current state of a population, which does not have to be the uninfected state. R 0 {\displaystyle R_{0}} is a dimensionless number and not a rate, which would have units of time −1 , [22] or units of time like doubling time . [23] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beating_heart_cadaver A beating heart cadaver is a body that is pronounced dead in all medical and legal definitions, connected to a medical ventilator , and retains cardio-pulmonary functions. This keeps the organs of the body, including the heart , functioning and alive. [1] As a result, the period of time in which the organs may be used for transplantation is extended. The heart contains pacemaker cells that will cause it to continue beating even when a patient is brain-dead . Other organs in the body do not have this capability and need the brain to be functioning to send signals to the organs to carry out their functions. A beating heart cadaver requires a ventilator to provide oxygen to its blood, but the heart will continue to beat on its own even in the absence of brain activity. [2] This allows organs to be preserved for a longer period of time in the case of a transplant or donation. A small number of cases in recent years indicate that it can also be implemented for a brain-dead pregnant woman to reach the full term of her pregnancy. [2] There is an advantage to beating heart cadaver organ donation because doctors are able to see the vitals of the organs and tell if they are stable and functioning before transplanting to an ailing patient. [3] This is not possible in a donation from someone pronounced dead. The observed phenomena of lifelike qualities after death is not a new concept. In René Descartes ' Discourse on the Method , he notes that decapitated animals move and display characteristics of a living body a few seconds after decapitation which was published in 1637. [4] This continued into the French Revolution where it was observed that people who had been beheaded showed movements in facial muscles and hearts could continue to beat for almost an hour past the time of beheading. [5] The guillotine in some cases did not completely sever head from body. In 1875 an examiner named Pierre Jean Cabanis was assigned the duty of making sure a body was truly dead. [4] There were also stories involving beheadings where the victims would stand up and walk around before falling dead. The ambiguity around brain death and true death has followed it to present day. In an effort to clarify some of these gray areas, the Harvard Medical Committee developed criteria for identifying a body as dead in 1968. [4] [5] These criteria required patients to be completely unaware and unresponsive to external stimuli, have no spontaneous muscle movements, and exhibit no reflexive response even when manipulated. They also required that an electroencephalography ( EEG ) show no signs of activity. [4] The purpose of this report was to encourage physicians to distinguish brain death and irreversible coma from a persistent vegetative state where the patient still has some awareness and cycles through sleep and wakefulness. [6] In 1971 a similar Minnesota criteria was published eliminating the EEG, repeating the exam after 12 hours, a severe lesion in the brain, and increasing the duration of the apnea test to four minutes rather than Harvard's three minute guideline. Other slight changes in the next decades included the United Kingdom's decision to eliminate the repetition of the exam and change from a duration of the apnea test to specified levels of CO 2 in 1976. [5] Later, in 1981 the President's Commission reinstated the apnea test and the repeat exam. In a study done in 1989, only 35% of 195 physicians and nurses involved in organ procurement polled knew brain death criteria. These were not the same nurses and physicians who diagnose brain death. Presently, there is hot debate over the protocol for diagnosing someone as brain dead due to widespread disinformation and misinformation on the internet. [7] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behaviour_therapy Behaviour therapy or behavioural psychotherapy is a broad term referring to clinical psychotherapy that uses techniques derived from behaviourism and/or cognitive psychology . It looks at specific, learned behaviours and how the environment, or other people's mental states , influences those behaviours, and consists of techniques based on learning theory, such as respondent or operant conditioning . Behaviourists who practice these techniques are either behaviour analysts or cognitive-behavioural therapists . [1] They tend to look for treatment outcomes that are objectively measurable. [2] Behaviour therapy does not involve one specific method, but it has a wide range of techniques that can be used to treat a person's psychological problems. [3] Behavioural psychotherapy is sometimes juxtaposed with cognitive psychotherapy . While cognitive behavioural therapy integrates aspects of both approaches, such as cognitive restructuring , positive reinforcement , habituation (or desensitisation ), counterconditioning , and modelling . Applied behaviour analysis (ABA) is the application of behaviour analysis that focuses on functionally assessing how behaviour is influenced by the observable learning environment and how to change such behaviour through contingency management or exposure therapies , which are used throughout clinical behaviour analysis therapies or other interventions based on the same learning principles. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benign Benignity (from Latin benignus "kind, good", itself deriving from bonus "good" and genus "origin") is any condition that is harmless in the long run. The opposite of benignity is malignity (or malignancy in medical discourse ). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioethics Bioethics is the study of the ethical issues emerging from advances in biology and medicine .  It is also moral discernment as it relates to medical policy and practice. Bioethics are concerned with the ethical questions that arise in the relationships among life sciences , biotechnology , medicine and medical ethics , politics , law , theology and philosophy . [1] It includes the study of values relating to primary care and other branches of medicine ( "the ethics of the ordinary" ). Ethics also relates to many other sciences outside the realm of biological sciences. The term Bioethics ( Greek bios , life; ethos , behavior) was coined in 1926 by Fritz Jahr in an article about a "bioethical imperative" regarding the use of animals and plants in scientific research. [2] In 1970, the American biochemist Van Rensselaer Potter used the term to describe the relationship between the biosphere and a growing human population. Potter's work laid the foundation for global ethics , a discipline centered around the link between biology, ecology, medicine, and human values. [3] [4] Sargent Shriver, the spouse of Eunice Kennedy Shriver, claimed that he had invented the word "bioethics" in the living room of his home in Bethesda, Maryland in 1970. He stated that he thought of the word after returning from a discussion earlier that evening at Georgetown University, where he discussed with others a possible Kennedy family sponsorship of an institute focused around the "application of moral philosophy to concrete medical dilemmas." [5] The field of bioethics has addressed a broad swathe of human inquiry; ranging from debates over the boundaries of life (e.g. abortion , euthanasia ), surrogacy, the allocation of scarce health care resources (e.g. organ donation , health care rationing ), to the right to refuse medical care for religious or cultural reasons.  Bioethicists often disagree among themselves over the precise limits of their discipline, debating whether the field should concern itself with the ethical evaluation of all questions involving biology and medicine, or only a subset of these questions. [6] Some bioethicists would narrow ethical evaluation only to the morality of medical treatments or technological innovations, and the timing of medical treatment of humans. Others would broaden the scope of ethical evaluation to include the morality of all actions that might help or harm organisms capable of feeling fear. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomedical_engineering Biomedical engineering ( BME ) or medical engineering is the application of engineering principles and design concepts to medicine and biology for healthcare purposes (e.g., diagnostic or therapeutic). BME is also traditionally known as "bioengineering", but this term has come to also refer to biological engineering . This field seeks to close the gap between engineering and medicine , combining the design and problem-solving skills of engineering with medical biological sciences to advance health care treatment, including diagnosis , monitoring , and therapy . [1] [2] Also included under the scope of a biomedical engineer is the management of current medical equipment in hospitals while adhering to relevant industry standards. This involves making equipment recommendations, procurement, routine testing, and preventive maintenance, a role also known as a Biomedical Equipment Technician (BMET) or as clinical engineering . Biomedical engineering has recently emerged as its own study, as compared to many other engineering fields. Such an evolution is common as a new field transitions from being an interdisciplinary specialization among already-established fields to being considered a field in itself. Much of the work in biomedical engineering consists of research and development , spanning a broad array of subfields (see below). Prominent biomedical engineering applications include the development of biocompatible prostheses , various diagnostic and therapeutic medical devices ranging from clinical equipment to micro-implants, common imaging equipment such as MRIs and EKG /ECGs, regenerative tissue growth, pharmaceutical drugs and therapeutic biologicals. Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary field that develops methods and software tools for understanding biological data. As an interdisciplinary field of science, bioinformatics combines computer science, statistics, mathematics, and engineering to analyze and interpret biological data. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_defect A birth defect , also known as a congenital disorder , is a condition present at birth regardless of its cause. [3] Birth defects may result in disabilities that may be physical , intellectual , or developmental . [3] The disabilities can range from mild to severe. [7] Birth defects are divided into two main types: structural disorders in which problems are seen with the shape of a body part and functional disorders in which problems exist with how a body part works. [4] Functional disorders include metabolic and degenerative disorders . [4] Some birth defects include both structural and functional disorders. [4] Birth defects may result from genetic or chromosomal disorders , exposure to certain medications or chemicals, or certain infections during pregnancy . [5] Risk factors include folate deficiency , drinking alcohol or smoking during pregnancy, poorly controlled diabetes , and a mother over the age of 35 years old. [6] [7] Many are believed to involve multiple factors. [7] Birth defects may be visible at birth or diagnosed by screening tests . [10] A number of defects can be detected before birth by different prenatal tests . [10] Treatment varies depending on the defect in question. [8] This may include therapy , medication, surgery, or assistive technology . [8] Birth defects affected about 96 million people as of 2015. [11] In the United States, they occur in about 3% of newborns. [2] They resulted in about 628,000 deaths in 2015, down from 751,000 in 1990. [12] [9] The types with the greatest numbers of deaths are congenital heart disease (303,000), followed by neural tube defects (65,000). [9] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolus Bolus may refer to: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowel_obstruction  Bowel obstruction , also known as intestinal obstruction , is a mechanical or functional obstruction of the intestines which prevents the normal movement of the products of digestion . [2] [5] Either the small bowel or large bowel may be affected. [1] Signs and symptoms include abdominal pain , vomiting , bloating and not passing gas . [1] Mechanical obstruction is the cause of about 5 to 15% of cases of severe abdominal pain of sudden onset requiring admission to hospital. [1] [2] Causes of bowel obstruction include adhesions , hernias , volvulus , endometriosis , inflammatory bowel disease , appendicitis , tumors , diverticulitis , ischemic bowel , tuberculosis and intussusception . [1] [2] Small bowel obstructions are most often due to adhesions and hernias while large bowel obstructions are most often due to tumors and volvulus. [1] [2] The diagnosis may be made on plain X-rays ; however, CT scan is more accurate. [1] Ultrasound or MRI may help in the diagnosis of children or pregnant women. [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brine Brine is a high-concentration solution of salt (NaCl) in water (H 2 O).  In different contexts, brine may refer to salt solutions ranging from about 3.5% (a typical concentration of seawater , on the lower end of solutions used for brining foods) up to about 26% (a typical saturated solution , depending on temperature). Lower levels of concentration are called by different names: fresh water , brackish water , and saline water . Brine naturally occurs on the Earth's surface ( salt lakes ), crust, and within brine pools on ocean bottom. High-concentration brine lakes typically emerge due to evaporation of ground saline water on high ambient temperatures. Brine is used for food processing and cooking ( pickling and brining ), for de-icing of roads and other structures, and in a number of technological processes. It is also a by-product of many industrial processes , such as desalination , and may pose an environmental risk due to its corrosive and toxic effects, so it requires wastewater treatment for proper disposal or further utilization ( fresh water recovery). [1] Saline water with relatively high concentration of salt (usually sodium chloride ) occurs naturally on Earth's surface ( salt lakes ), crust, and within brine pools on ocean bottom. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsule Capsule may refer to: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childbed_fever Postpartum infections , also known as childbed fever and puerperal fever , are any bacterial infections of the female reproductive tract following childbirth or miscarriage . [1] Signs and symptoms usually include a fever greater than 38.0 °C (100.4 °F), chills, lower abdominal pain, and possibly bad-smelling vaginal discharge . [1] It usually occurs after the first 24 hours and within the first ten days following delivery. [5] The most common infection is that of the uterus and surrounding tissues known as puerperal sepsis , postpartum metritis , or postpartum endometritis . [1] [6] Risk factors include Caesarean section (C-section), the presence of certain bacteria such as group B streptococcus in the vagina, premature rupture of membranes , multiple vaginal exams , manual removal of the placenta , and prolonged labour among others. [1] [2] Most infections involve a number of types of bacteria. [1] Diagnosis is rarely helped by culturing of the vagina or blood. [1] In those who do not improve, medical imaging may be required. [1] Other causes of fever following delivery include breast engorgement , urinary tract infections , infections of an abdominal incision or an episiotomy , and atelectasis . [1] [2] Due to the risks following Caesarean section, it is recommended that all women receive a preventive dose of antibiotics such as ampicillin around the time of surgery. [1] Treatment of established infections is with antibiotics, with most people improving in two to three days. [1] In those with mild disease, oral antibiotics may be used; otherwise intravenous antibiotics are recommended. [1] Common antibiotics include a combination of ampicillin and gentamicin following vaginal delivery or clindamycin and gentamicin in those who have had a C-section. [1] In those who are not improving with appropriate treatment, other complications such an abscess should be considered. [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic Chronic may refer to: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial  Clinical trials are experiments or observations done in clinical research . Such prospective biomedical or behavioral research studies on human participants are designed to answer specific questions about biomedical or behavioral interventions, including new treatments (such as novel vaccines , drugs , dietary choices , dietary supplements , and medical devices ) and known interventions that warrant further study and comparison. Clinical trials generate data on dosage, safety and efficacy . [1] They are conducted only after they have received health authority/ethics committee approval in the country where approval of the therapy is sought. These authorities are responsible for vetting the risk/benefit ratio of the trial—their approval does not mean the therapy is 'safe' or effective, only that the trial may be conducted. Depending on product type and development stage, investigators initially enroll volunteers or patients into small pilot studies , and subsequently conduct progressively larger scale comparative studies. Clinical trials can vary in size and cost, and they can involve a single research center or multiple centers , in one country or in multiple countries. Clinical study design aims to ensure the scientific validity and reproducibility of the results. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive-behavioral_therapy  Cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT ) is a psycho-social intervention [1] [2] that aims to improve mental health . [3] CBT focuses on challenging and changing cognitive distortions (e.g. thoughts, beliefs, and attitudes) and behaviors, improving emotional regulation , [2] [4] and the development of personal coping strategies that target solving current problems. It was originally designed to treat depression , but its uses have been expanded to include treatment of a number of mental health conditions, including anxiety , [5] [6] alcohol and drug use problems, marital problems, and eating disorders. [7] [8] CBT includes a number of cognitive or behavior psychotherapies that treat defined psychopathologies using evidence-based techniques and strategies. [9] [10] [11] CBT is based on the combination of the basic principles from behavioral and cognitive psychology . [2] It is different from historical approaches to psychotherapy , such as the psychoanalytic approach where the therapist looks for the unconscious meaning behind the behaviors and then formulates a diagnosis. Instead, CBT is a "problem-focused" and "action-oriented" form of therapy, meaning it is used to treat specific problems related to a diagnosed mental disorder. The therapist's role is to assist the client in finding and practicing effective strategies to address the identified goals and decrease symptoms of the disorder. [12] CBT is based on the belief that thought distortions and maladaptive behaviors play a role in the development and maintenance of psychological disorders , [3] and that symptoms and associated distress can be reduced by teaching new information-processing skills and coping mechanisms. [1] [12] [13] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity In medicine , comorbidity is the presence of one or more additional conditions often co-occurring (that is, concomitant or concurrent ) with a primary condition. Comorbidity describes the effect of all other conditions an individual patient might have other than the primary condition of interest, and can be physiological or psychological. In the context of mental health, comorbidity often refers to disorders that are often coexistent with each other, such as depression and anxiety disorders. Comorbidity can indicate either a condition existing simultaneously, but independently with another condition or a related medical condition. The latter sense of the term causes some overlap with the concept of complications . For example, in longstanding diabetes mellitus , the extent to which coronary artery disease is an independent comorbidity versus a diabetic complication is not easy to measure, because both diseases are quite multivariate and there are likely aspects of both simultaneity and consequence. The same is true of intercurrent diseases in pregnancy . In other examples, the true independence or relation is not ascertainable because syndromes and associations are often identified long before pathogenetic commonalities are confirmed (and, in some examples, before they are even hypothesized ). In psychiatric diagnoses it has been argued in part that this "'use of imprecise language may lead to correspondingly imprecise thinking', [and] this usage of the term 'comorbidity' should probably be avoided." [1] However, in many medical examples, such as comorbid diabetes mellitus and coronary artery disease, it makes little difference which word is used, as long as the medical complexity is duly recognized and addressed. Many tests attempt to standardize the "weight" or value of comorbid conditions, whether they are secondary or tertiary illnesses. Each test attempts to consolidate each individual comorbid condition into a single, predictive variable that measures mortality or other outcomes. Researchers have validated such tests because of their predictive value, but no one test is as yet recognized as a  standard. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compliance_(medicine) In medicine, patient compliance (also adherence , capacitance ) describes the degree to which a patient correctly follows medical advice. Most commonly, it refers to medication or drug compliance, but it can also apply to other situations such as medical device use, self care , self-directed exercises, or therapy sessions. Both patient and health-care provider affect compliance, and a positive physician-patient relationship is the most important factor in improving compliance, [1] The cost of prescription medication also plays a major role. [2] Compliance can be confused with concordance , which is the process by which a patient and clinician make decisions together about treatment. [3] Worldwide, non-compliance is a major obstacle to the effective delivery of health care. 2003 estimates from the World Health Organization indicated that only about 50% of patients with chronic diseases living in developed countries follow treatment recommendations with particularly low rates of adherence to therapies for asthma , diabetes , and hypertension . [1] Major barriers to compliance are thought to include the complexity of modern medication regimens, poor "health literacy" and not understanding treatment benefits, occurrence of undiscussed side effects, poor treatment satisfaction, cost of prescription medicine, and poor communication or lack of trust between a patient and his or her health-care provider. [4] [5] [6] [7] Efforts to improve compliance have been aimed at simplifying medication packaging, providing effective medication reminders, improving patient education, and limiting the number of medications prescribed simultaneously. Studies show a great variation in terms of characteristics and effects of interventions to improve medicine adherence. [8] It is still unclear how adherence can consistently be improved in order to promote clinically important effects. [8] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cow_urine  Cow urine is a liquid by-product of metabolism in cows. Cow urine is also used in medicine in India , Myanmar , Nepal , and Nigeria . While cow urine and cow dung have benefits as fertilizers, the proponents' claims about its curing diseases and cancer have no scientific backing. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] Some Hindus claim that cow urine has a special significance as a medicinal drink. [6] [1] The sprinkling of cow urine is said to have a spiritual cleansing effect as well. [7] [8] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryonics  Cryonics (from Greek : κρύος kryos meaning 'cold') is the low-temperature freezing (usually at −196 °C or −320.8 °F or 77.1 K) and storage of a human corpse or severed head, with the speculative hope that resurrection may be possible in the future. [1] [2] Cryonics is regarded with skepticism within the mainstream scientific community. It is generally viewed as a pseudoscience , [3] and its practice has been characterized as quackery . [4] [5] Cryonics procedures can begin only after clinical death , and cryonics "patients" are legally dead . Cryonics procedures may begin within minutes of death, [6] and use cryoprotectants to prevent ice formation during cryopreservation. [7] It is, however, not possible for a corpse to be reanimated after undergoing vitrification , as this causes damage to the brain including its neural networks . [8] The first corpse to be frozen was that of Dr. James Bedford in 1967. [9] As of 2014, about 250 dead bodies had been cryopreserved in the United States , and 1,500 people had made arrangements for cryopreservation of their corpses. [10] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis Diagnosis is the identification of the nature and cause of a certain phenomenon. Diagnosis is used in many different disciplines , with variations in the use of logic , analytics , and experience, to determine " cause and effect ". In systems engineering and computer science , it is typically used to determine the causes of symptoms, mitigations, and solutions. [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine Doctor of Medicine (abbreviated M.D. , from the Latin Medicinae Doctor ) is a medical degree , the meaning of which varies between different jurisdictions. In the United States , and some other countries, the M.D. denotes a professional graduate degree . This generally arose because many in 18th-century medical professions trained in Scotland , which used the M.D. degree nomenclature. In England, however, Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery was used and eventually in the 19th century became the standard in Scotland too. Thus, in the United Kingdom , Ireland and other countries, the M.D. is a research doctorate , higher doctorate , honorary doctorate or applied clinical degree restricted to those who already hold a professional degree in medicine; in those countries, the equivalent professional to the North American and some others use of M.D. is still typically titled Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery ( M.B.B.S. ). [2] The first medical degrees were awarded by the Schola Medica Salernitana around the year 1000, including to women such as Trota of Salerno . [3] [4] The degrees received legal sanction in 1137 by Roger II of Sicily and in 1231 by Emperor Federico II , in the Constitution of Melfi . [5] In the titles XLIV-LXXXIX of the third book of the Constitutions of 1231, it was established that the activity of a physician ( medicus ) could only be carried out by physicians holding a medical degree, the Licentia Medendi (license to practice medicine), by the Schola Medica Salernitana (the only school in the kingdom authorized to award degrees in medicine). [3] [6] This degree was awarded after a curriculum composed of three years of study of logic , five years of medical studies , an examination of a commission composed of the professors of the university, a one-year apprenticeship with an expert doctor, and a final examination before the commissioners of the Royal Curia and the Provincial Curias. [6] In 1703, the University of Glasgow 's first medical graduate, Samuel Benion, was issued with the academic degree of Doctor of Medicine. [7] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor-patient_relationship A doctor-patient relationship is a complex relationship between a doctor and a patient . This relationship is formed when a doctor attends to a patient's medical needs and is usually through consent. [1] This unique relationship is built on trust, respect, communication, and a common understanding of both the doctor and patients' sides. The trust aspect of this relationship goes both ways, the doctor trusts the patient to reveal any information that may be relevant to the case and in turn, the patient trusts the doctor to respect their privacy and not disclose this information to outside parties. An important dynamic of this relationship is that the doctor is bonded by oath to follow certain ethical guidelines ( Hippocratic Oath ) whereas the patient is not. [2] [3] It is important to remember that the doctor–patient relationship is a central part of health care and the practice of medicine . Additionally, the healthiness of a doctor-patient relationship is essential to keep the quality of the patient's healthcare high as well as to ensure that the doctor is functioning at their optimum. In more recent times healthcare has become more patient-centered and this has brought a new dynamic to this ancient relationship. A patient must have confidence in the competence of their physician and must feel that they can confide in him or her. For most physicians, the establishment of good rapport with a patient is important.  Some medical specialties, such as psychiatry and family medicine , emphasize the physician–patient relationship more than others, such as pathology or radiology , which have very little contact with patients. The quality of the patient–physician relationship is important to both parties. The doctor and patient's values and perspectives about disease, life, and time available play a role in building up this relationship. A strong relationship between the doctor and patient may lead to frequent, freely-offered quality information about the patient's disease and as a result, better healthcare for the patient and their family. Enhancing both the accuracy of the diagnosis and the patient's knowledge about the disease contributes to a good relationship between the doctor and the patient. [4] In a poor doctor-patient relationship, the physician's ability to make a full assessment may be compromised and the patient may be more likely to distrust the diagnosis and proposed treatment. The downstream effects of this mistrust may include decreased patient adherence to the physician's medical advice , which could result in poorer health outcomes for the patient. In these circumstances, and also in cases where there is genuine divergence of medical opinions, a second opinion from another physician may be sought, or the patient may choose to go to another physician that they trust more. Additionally, the benefits of any placebo effect are also based upon the patient's subjective assessment (conscious or unconscious) of the physician's credibility and skills. [5] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabethan_collar An Elizabethan collar , E-collar , Buster collar or pet cone (sometimes humorously called a pet lamp-shade , pet radar dish , dog-saver , or cone of shame ) is a protective medical device worn by an animal, usually a cat or dog. Shaped like a truncated cone, its purpose is to prevent the animal from biting or licking at its body or scratching at its head or neck while wounds or injuries heal . [1] The collars are named from the ruffs worn in Elizabethan times .  A U.S. patent was filed by Frank L. Johnson in 1959. [2] The device is generally attached to the pet's usual collar with strings or tabs passed through holes punched in the sides of the plastic. The neck of the collar should be short enough to let the animal eat and drink. Although most pets adjust to them quite well, others will not eat or drink with the collar in place and the collar is temporarily removed for meals. [3] While purpose-made collars can be purchased from veterinarians or pet stores, they can also be made from plastic and cardboard or by using plastic flowerpots, wastebaskets, buckets or lampshades. Modern collars might involve soft fabric trim along the edges to increase comfort and velcro surfaces for ease of attachment and removal. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENCODE The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements ( ENCODE ) is a public research project which aims to identify functional elements in the human genome . Encode was launched by the US National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) in September 2003. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] Intended as a follow-up to the Human Genome Project , the ENCODE project aims to identify all functional elements in the human genome . The project involves a worldwide consortium of research groups, and data generated from this project can be accessed through public databases. The project began its fourth phase in February 2017. [7] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eradication_of_infectious_diseases  Eradication is the reduction of an infectious disease 's prevalence in the global host population to zero. [1] It is sometimes confused with elimination, which describes either the reduction of an infectious disease's prevalence in a regional population to zero or the reduction of the global prevalence to a negligible amount. Further confusion arises from the use of the term eradication to refer to the total removal of a given pathogen from an individual (also known as clearance of an infection ), particularly in the context of HIV and certain other viruses where such cures are sought. The selection of infectious diseases for eradication is based on rigorous criteria, as both biological and technical features determine whether a pathogenic organism is (at least potentially) eradicable. The targeted organism must not have a non-human reservoir (or, in the case of animal diseases, the infection reservoir must be an easily identifiable species, as in the case of rinderpest ), and/or amplify in the environment. This implies that sufficient information on the life cycle and transmission dynamics is available at the time an eradication initiative is programmed. An efficient and practical intervention (such as a vaccine or antibiotic) must be available to interrupt transmission of the infective agent. Studies of measles in the pre-vaccination era led to the concept of the critical community size , the size of the population below which a pathogen ceases to circulate. [2] The use of vaccination programs before the introduction of an eradication campaign can reduce the susceptible population. The disease to be eradicated should be clearly identifiable, and an accurate diagnostic tool should exist. Economic considerations, as well as societal and political support and commitment, are other crucial factors that determine eradication feasibility. [3] [4] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_(medicine) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetal_viability Fetal viability or foetal viability is the ability of a fetus to survive outside the uterus . [1] Viability , as the word has been used in United States constitutional law since Roe v. Wade , is the potential of the fetus to survive outside the uterus after birth, natural or induced, when supported by up-to-date medicine. Fetal viability depends largely on the fetal organ maturity, and environmental conditions. [2] According to Websters Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary of the English Language, viability of a fetus means having reached such a stage of development as to be capable of living, under normal conditions, outside the uterus. Viability exists as a function of biomedical and technological capacities, which are different in different parts of the world. As a consequence, there is, at the present time, no worldwide, uniform gestational age that defines viability. [3] According to the McGraw-Hill medical dictionary a nonviable fetus is "an expelled or delivered fetus which, although living, cannot possibly survive to the point of sustaining life independently, even with support of the best available medical therapy." [4] A legal definition states: "Nonviable means not capable of living, growing, or developing and functioning successfully. It is antithesis of viable, which is defined as having attained such form and development of organs as to be normally capable of living outside the uterus." [Wolfe v. Isbell, 291 Ala. 327, 329 (Ala. 1973)] [5] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Geneva_Convention The First Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded in Armies in the Field, held on 22 August 1864, is the first of four treaties of the Geneva Conventions . It defines "the basis on which rest the rules of international law for the protection of the victims of armed conflicts." [1] After the first treaty was adopted in 1864, it was significantly revised and replaced in 1906, 1929, and finally 1949. It is inextricably linked to the International Committee of the Red Cross , which is both the instigator for the inception and enforcer of the articles in these conventions. The 1864 Geneva Convention was instituted at a critical period in European political and military history. Elsewhere, the American Civil War had been raging since 1861, and would ultimately claim between 750,000 and 900,000 lives. Between the fall of Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 and the rise of his nephew in the Italian campaign of 1859 , the powers had maintained peace in western Europe. [2] Yet, with the 1853–1856 conflict in the Crimea , war had returned to Europe, and while those troubles were "in a distant and inaccessible region" northern Italy was "so accessible from all parts of western Europe that it instantly filled with curious observers;" while the bloodshed was not excessive the sight of it was unfamiliar and shocking. [2] Despite its intent of ameliorating the ravages of war, the inception of the 1864 Geneva Convention inaugurated "a renewal of military activity on a large scale, to which the people of western Europe…had not been accustomed since the first Napoleon had been eliminated." [2] The movement for an international set of laws governing the treatment and care for the wounded and prisoners of war began when relief activist Henry Dunant witnessed the Battle of Solferino in 1859, fought between French- Piedmontese and Austrian armies in Northern Italy. [3] The subsequent suffering of 40,000 wounded soldiers left on the field due to lack of facilities, personnel, and truces to give them medical aid moved Dunant into action. Upon return to Geneva , Dunant published his account Un Souvenir de Solferino . [4] He urged the calling together of an international conference and soon co-founded the International Committee of the Red Cross in 1863. [5] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folding@home Folding@home ( FAH or F@h ) is a distributed computing project aimed to help scientists develop new therapeutics for a variety of diseases by the means of simulating protein dynamics. This includes the process of protein folding and the movements of proteins, and is reliant on simulations run on volunteers' personal computers. [4] Folding@home is currently based at Washington University in St. Louis and led by Greg Bowman, a former student of Vijay Pande . [5] The project utilizes central processing units (CPUs), graphics processing units (GPUs), PlayStation 3s , Message Passing Interface (used for computing on multi-core processors ), and some Sony Xperia smartphones for distributed computing and scientific research. The project uses statistical simulation methodology that is a paradigm shift from traditional computing methods. [6] As part of the client–server model network architecture , the volunteered machines each receive pieces of a simulation (work units), complete them, and return them to the project's database servers , where the units are compiled into an overall simulation. Volunteers can track their contributions on the Folding@home website, which makes volunteers' participation competitive and encourages long-term involvement. Folding@home is one of the world's fastest computing systems. With heightened interest in the project as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic , [7] the system achieved a speed of approximately 1.22 exaflops by late March 2020 and reached 2.43 exaflops by April 12, 2020, [8] making it the world's first exaflop computing system . This level of performance from its large-scale computing network has allowed researchers to run computationally costly atomic-level simulations of protein folding thousands of times longer than formerly achieved. Since its launch on October 1, 2000, the Pande Lab has produced 225 scientific research papers as a direct result of Folding@home. [9] Results from the project's simulations agree well with experiments. [10] [11] [12] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_counselling Genetic counseling is the process of advising individuals and families affected by or at risk of genetic disorders to help them understand and adapt to the medical, psychological and familial implications of genetic contributions to disease; this field is considered necessary for the implementation of genomic medicine. [1] [2] The process integrates: The practice of advising people about inherited traits began around the turn of the 20th century, shortly after William Bateson suggested that the new medical and biological study of heredity be called “genetics”. [3] Heredity became intertwined with social reforms when the field of modern eugenics took form. Although initially well-intentioned, ultimately the movement had disastrous consequences; many states in the United States had laws mandating the sterilization of certain individuals, others were not allowed to immigrate and by the 1930s these ideas were accepted by many other countries including in Germany where euthanasia for the “genetically defective” was legalized in 1939. [3] This part of the history of genetics is at the heart of the now “non directive” approach to genetic counseling. [4] Sheldon Clark Reed coined the term genetic counseling in 1947 and published the book Counseling in Medical Genetics in 1955. [5] Most of the early genetic counseling clinics were run by non-medical scientists or by those who were not experienced clinicians. [6] With the growth in knowledge of genetic disorders and the appearance of medical genetics as a distinct specialty in the 1960s, genetic counseling progressively became medicalized, representing one of the key components of clinical genetics. [7] It was not, though, until later that the importance of a firm psychological basis was recognized and became an essential part of genetic counseling, the writings of Seymour Kessler making a particular contribution to this. [8] The first master's degree genetic counseling program in the United States was founded in 1969 at Sarah Lawrence College in Bronxville, New York. [9] In 1979, the National Society of Genetic Counselors (NSGC) was founded and led by the first president, Audrey Heimler. [10] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_screening Genetic testing , also known as DNA testing , is used to identify changes in DNA sequence or chromosome structure. Genetic testing can also include measuring the results of genetic changes, such as RNA analysis as an output of gene expression , or through biochemical analysis to measure specific protein output. [1] In a medical setting, genetic testing can be used to diagnose or rule out suspected genetic disorders, predict risks for specific conditions, or gain information that can be used to customize medical treatments based on an individual's genetic makeup. [1] Genetic testing can also be used to determine biological relatives, such as a child's parentage (genetic mother and father) through DNA paternity testing , [2] or be used to broadly predict an individual's ancestry . [3] Genetic testing of plants and animals can be used for similar reasons as in humans (e.g. to assess relatedness/ancestry or predict/diagnose genetic disorders), [4] to gain information used for selective breeding , [5] or for efforts to boost genetic diversity in endangered populations. [6] The variety of genetic tests has expanded throughout the years. Early forms of genetic testing which began in the 1950s involved counting the number of chromosomes per cell. Deviations from the expected number of chromosomes (46 in humans) could lead to a diagnosis of certain genetic conditions such as trisomy 21 ( Down syndrome ) or monosomy X ( Turner syndrome ). [7] In the 1970s, a method to stain specific regions of chromosomes, called chromosome banding , was developed that allowed more detailed analysis of chromosome structure and diagnosis of genetic disorders that involved large structural rearrangements. [8] In addition to analyzing whole chromosomes ( cytogenetics ), genetic testing has expanded to include the fields of molecular genetics and genomics which can identify changes at the level of individual genes, parts of genes, or even single nucleotide "letters" of DNA sequence. [7] According to the National Institutes of Health , there are tests available for more than 2,000 genetic conditions, [9] and one study estimated that as of 2017 there were more than 75,000 genetic tests on the market. [10] Genetic testing is "the analysis of chromosomes ( DNA ), proteins, and certain metabolites in order to detect heritable disease-related genotypes , mutations , phenotypes , or karyotypes for clinical purposes." [11] It can provide information about a person 's genes and chromosomes throughout life. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germ_theory_of_disease  The germ theory of disease is the currently accepted scientific theory for many diseases . It states that microorganisms known as pathogens or "germs" can lead to disease. These small organisms, too small to see without magnification, invade humans, other animals, and other living hosts. Their growth and reproduction within their hosts can cause disease. "Germ" may refer to not just a bacterium but to any type of microorganism, such as protists or fungi , or even non-living pathogens that can cause disease, such as viruses , prions , or viroids . [1] Diseases caused by pathogens are called infectious diseases . Even when a pathogen is the principal cause of a disease, environmental and hereditary factors often influence the severity of the disease, and whether a potential host individual becomes infected when exposed to the pathogen. Basic forms of germ theory were proposed in the late Middle Ages by physicians including Ibn Sina in 1025, [2] Ibn Khatima and Ibn al-Khatib in the 14th century, [3] Girolamo Fracastoro in 1546, and expanded upon by Marcus von Plenciz in 1762. However, such views were held in disdain in Europe, where Galen's miasma theory remained dominant among scientists and doctors. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GISAID GISAID is a global science initiative and primary source established in 2008 that provides open-access to genomic data of influenza viruses [3] and the coronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. [4] [5] On January 10, 2020, the first whole-genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 were made available on GISAID, which enabled global responses to the pandemic, [6] including the development of the first vaccines [7] and diagnostic tests [8] to detect SARS-CoV-2. GISAID facilitates genomic epidemiology and real-time surveillance to monitor the emergence of new COVID-19 viral strains across the planet. [6] [9] Since its establishment as an alternative to sharing avian influenza data [10] via conventional public-domain archives, [3] [11] GISAID has been recognized for incentivizing rapid exchange of outbreak data [11] during the H1N1 pandemic [12] [13] in 2009, the H7N9 epidemic [14] [15] in 2013, and the COVID-19 pandemic [16] [17] in 2020. GISAID was recognized for its importance to global health by G20 health ministers in 2017, [18] and in 2020 the World Health Organization chief scientist called the data-science initiative "a game changer". [4] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow_Coma_Scale The Glasgow Coma Scale [1] ( GCS ) is a clinical scale used to reliably measure a person's level of consciousness after a brain injury . The GCS assesses a person based on their ability to perform eye movements, speak, and move their body. These three behaviors make up the three elements of the scale: eye, verbal, and motor. A person's GCS score can range from 3 (completely unresponsive) to 15 (responsive). This score is used to guide immediate medical care after a brain injury (such as a car accident) and also to monitor hospitalized patients and track their level of consciousness. Lower GCS scores are correlated with higher risk of death. However, the GCS score alone should not be used on its own to predict the outcome for an individual person with brain injury. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care Health care , health-care , or healthcare is the maintenance or improvement of health via the prevention , diagnosis , treatment , recovery, or cure of disease , illness , injury , and other physical and mental impairments in people. Health care is delivered by health professionals and allied health fields . Medicine , dentistry , pharmacy , midwifery , nursing , optometry , audiology , psychology , occupational therapy , physical therapy , athletic training and other health professions are all part of health care. It includes work done in providing primary care , secondary care, and tertiary care , as well as in public health . Access to health care may vary across countries, communities, and individuals, influenced by social and economic conditions as well as health policies . Providing health care services means "the timely use of personal health services to achieve the best possible health outcomes". [2] Factors to consider in terms of healthcare access include financial limitations (such as insurance coverage), geographic barriers (such as additional transportation costs, the possibility to take paid time off of work to use such services), and personal limitations (lack of ability to communicate with healthcare providers, poor health literacy, low income). [3] Limitations to health care services affects negatively the use of medical services, the efficacy of treatments, and overall outcome (well-being, mortality rates). Health care systems are organizations established to meet the health needs of targeted populations. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), a well-functioning health care system requires a financing mechanism, a well-trained and adequately paid workforce , reliable information on which to base decisions and policies , and well maintained health facilities to deliver quality medicines and technologies. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_immunity Herd immunity (also called herd effect , community immunity , population immunity , or mass immunity ) is a form of indirect protection from infectious disease that can occur with some diseases when a sufficient percentage of a population has become immune to an infection, whether through vaccination or previous infections, thereby reducing the likelihood of infection for individuals who lack immunity. [1] [2] [3] Immune individuals are unlikely to contribute to disease transmission , disrupting chains of infection, which stops or slows the spread of disease. [4] The greater the proportion of immune individuals in a community, the smaller the probability that non-immune individuals will come into contact with an infectious individual. [1] Individuals can become immune by recovering from an earlier infection or through vaccination . [4] Some individuals cannot become immune because of medical conditions, such as an immunodeficiency or immunosuppression , and for this group herd immunity is a crucial method of protection. [5] [6] Once the herd immunity threshold has been reached, disease gradually disappears from a population. [6] This elimination, if achieved worldwide, may result in the permanent reduction in the number of infections to zero, called eradication . [7] Herd immunity created via vaccination contributed to the eventual eradication of smallpox in 1977 and has contributed to the reduction of other diseases. [8] Herd immunity applies only to contagious disease, meaning that it is transmitted from one individual to another. [6] Tetanus , for example, is infectious but not contagious, so herd immunity does not apply. [5] Herd immunity was recognized as a naturally occurring phenomenon in the 1930s when it was observed that after a significant number of children had become immune to measles , the number of new infections temporarily decreased. [9] Mass vaccination to induce herd immunity has since become common and proved successful in preventing the spread of many infectious diseases. [10] Opposition to vaccination has posed a challenge to herd immunity, allowing preventable diseases to persist in or return to populations with inadequate vaccination rates. [11] [12] [13] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospice Hospice care is a type of health care that focuses on the palliation of a terminally ill patient's pain and symptoms and attending to their emotional and spiritual needs at the end of life. Hospice care prioritizes comfort and quality of life by reducing pain and suffering. Hospice care provides an alternative to therapies focused on life-prolonging measures that may be arduous, likely to cause more symptoms, or are not aligned with a person's goals. Hospice care in the United States is largely defined by the practices of the Medicare system and other health insurance providers, which cover inpatient or at home hospice care for patients with terminal diseases who are estimated to live six months or less. Hospice care under the Medicare Hospice Benefit requires documentation from two physicians estimating a person has less than six months to live if the disease follows its usual course. Hospice benefits include access to a multidisciplinary treatment team specialized in end of life care and can be accessed in the home, long term care facility or the hospital. [1] Outside the United States, the term tends to be primarily associated with the particular buildings or institutions that specialize in such care. Such institutions may similarly provide care mostly in an end-of-life setting, but they may also be available for patients with other palliative care needs. Hospice care includes assistance for patients' families to help them cope with what is happening and provide care and support to keep the patient at home. [2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_microbiome  The human microbiome is the aggregate of all microbiota that reside on or within human tissues and biofluids along with the corresponding anatomical sites in which they reside, [1] including the skin, mammary glands, seminal fluid, uterus, ovarian follicles, lung, saliva, oral mucosa , conjunctiva , biliary tract , and gastrointestinal tract . Types of human microbiota include bacteria , archaea , fungi , protists and viruses . Though micro-animals can also live on the human body, they are typically excluded from this definition. In the context of genomics , the term human microbiome is sometimes used to refer to the collective genomes of resident microorganisms; [2] however, the term human metagenome has the same meaning. [1] Humans are colonized by many microorganisms, with approximately the same order of magnitude of non-human cells as human cells. [3] Some microorganisms that colonize humans are commensal , meaning they co-exist without harming humans; others have a mutualistic relationship with their human hosts. [2] : 700 [4] Conversely, some non- pathogenic microorganisms can harm human hosts via the metabolites they produce, like trimethylamine , which the human body converts to trimethylamine N-oxide via FMO3 -mediated oxidation. [5] [6] Certain microorganisms perform tasks that are known to be useful to the human host but the role of most of them is not well understood. Those that are expected to be present, and that under normal circumstances do not cause disease, are sometimes deemed normal flora or normal microbiota . [2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrochloric_acid Hydrochloric acid , also known as muriatic acid , is an aqueous solution of hydrogen chloride .  It is a colorless solution with a distinctive pungent smell. It is classified as a strong acid . It is a component of the gastric acid in the digestive systems of most animal species, including humans. Hydrochloric acid is an important laboratory reagent and industrial chemical. [7] [8] In the early tenth century, the Persian physician and alchemist Abu Bakr al-Razi (854–925, Latin: Rhazes) conducted experiments with sal ammoniac ( ammonium chloride ) and vitriol (hydrated sulfates of various metals), which he distilled together, thus producing the gas hydrogen chloride. In doing so, al-Razi came very close to discovering hydrochloric acid, but it appears that he disregarded the gaseous products of his experiments, concentrating instead on the color changes that could be effected in the residue. [9] Drawing on al-Razi's experiments, the De aluminibus et salibus ("On Alums and Salts", an eleventh- or twelfth century Arabic text falsely attributed to al-Razi and translated into Latin in the second half of the twelfth century by Gerard of Cremona , 1144-1187) described the heating of metals with various salts, which in the case of mercury resulted in the production of mercury(II) chloride (corrosive sublimate). [10] In this process, hydrochloric acid actually started to form, but it immediately reacted with the mercury to produce corrosive sublimate. Thirteenth-century Latin alchemists, for whom the De aluminibus et salibus was one of the main reference works, were fascinated by the chlorinating properties of corrosive sublimate, and they soon discovered that when the metals are eliminated from the process of heating vitriols, alums , and salts, strong mineral acids can directly be distilled. [11] One important invention that resulted from the discovery of the mineral acids is aqua regia , a mixture of nitric acid and hydrochloric acid in a 1:3 proportion, capable of dissolving gold. This was first described in pseudo-Geber 's De inventione veritatis ("On the Discovery of Truth", after c. 1300), where aqua regia was prepared by adding ammonium chloride to nitric acid. [12] However, the production of hydrochloric acid itself (i.e., as an isolated substance rather than as already mixed with nitric acid) depended on the use of more efficient cooling apparatus, which would only develop in subsequent centuries. [13] Thus, recipes for the production of hydrochloric acid only appear in the late sixteenth century, the earliest being found in Giovanni Battista Della Porta 's (1535–1615) Magiae naturalis ("Natural Magic") and in the works of other contemporary chemists like Andreas Libavius (c. 1550–1616), Jean Beguin (1550–1620), and Oswald Croll (c. 1563– 1609). [14] The knowledge of mineral acids such as hydrochloric acid would be of key importance to seventeenth-century chemists like Daniel Sennert (1572–1637) and Robert Boyle (1627–1691), who used their capability to rapidly dissolve metals in their demonstrations of the composite nature of bodies. [15] Because it was produced from rock salt according to the methods of Johann Rudolph Glauber , hydrochloric acid was historically called by European alchemists spirits of salt or acidum salis (salt acid). Both names are still used, especially in other languages, such as German : Salzsäure , Dutch : Zoutzuur , Swedish : Saltsyra , Spanish : Salfumán , Turkish : Tuz Ruhu , Polish : kwas solny and Czech : kyselina solná https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informed_consent Informed consent is a process for getting permission before conducting a healthcare intervention on a person, for conducting some form of research on a person, or for disclosing a person's information. A health care provider may ask a patient to consent to receive therapy before providing it, a clinical researcher may ask a research participant before enrolling that person into a clinical trial , and a researcher may ask a research participant before starting some form of controlled experiment . Informed consent is collected according to guidelines from the fields of medical ethics and research ethics . Free consent is a cognate term enshrined in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights . The Covenant was adopted in 1966 by the United Nations , and supposed to be in force by 23 March 1976. Article seven prohibits experiments conducted without the "free consent to medical or scientific experimentation" of the subject. [1] As of September 2019 [update] , the Covenant has 173 parties and six more signatories without ratification. [2] An informed consent can be said to have been given based upon a clear appreciation and understanding of the facts, implications, and consequences of an action. To give informed consent, the individual concerned must have adequate reasoning faculties and be in possession of all relevant facts. Impairments to reasoning and judgment that may prevent informed consent include basic intellectual or emotional immaturity, high levels of stress such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or a severe intellectual disability , severe mental disorder , intoxication , severe sleep deprivation , Alzheimer's disease , or being in a coma . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhaler An inhaler (also known as a puffer , pump or allergy spray ) is a medical device used for delivering medicines into the lungs through the work of a person's breathing. This allows medicines to be delivered to and absorbed in the lungs, which provides the ability for targeted medical treatment to this specific region of the body, as well as a reduction in the side effects of oral medications. There are a wide variety of inhalers, and they are commonly used to treat numerous medical conditions with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) being among the most notable. [1] Some of the common types of inhalers include meter-dosed inhalers , dry powder inhalers , soft mist inhalers, and nebulizers . Each device has advantages and disadvantages and can be selected based on specific patient needs, as well as age, coordination, and lung function. [2] Proper education on inhaler use is important to ensure that inhaled medication takes its proper effects in the lungs. [3] Inhalers are designed to deliver medication directly to the lungs through a person's own breathing. This may benefit a patient by providing medicines directly to areas of disease, allowing medication to take a greater effect on its intended target, and limit side effects of medications due to localized treatment. [1] Inhalers are used in a variety of different medical conditions with diseases of the lungs and respiratory system being among the most common. These conditions utilize medications designed to decrease airway inflammation and obstruction to allow for easier and less strained breathing. [4] Antibiotic medications have even been developed for inhalers to allow for direct delivery to areas of infection within the lungs. [5] Two of the most common conditions that warrant inhaler therapy are asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . [4] [6] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interventional_Radiology Interventional radiology ( IR ) is a medical subspecialty that performs various minimally-invasive procedures using medical imaging guidance, such as x-ray fluoroscopy , computed tomography , magnetic resonance imaging , or ultrasound . IR performs both diagnostic and therapeutic procedures through very small incisions or body orifices . Diagnostic IR procedures are those intended to help make a diagnosis or guide further medical treatment, and include image-guided biopsy of a tumor or injection of an imaging contrast agent into a hollow structure, such as a blood vessel or a duct . By contrast, therapeutic IR procedures provide direct treatment—they include catheter-based medicine delivery, medical device placement (e.g., stents), and angioplasty of narrowed structures. The main benefits of interventional radiology techniques are that they can reach the deep structures of the body through a body orifice or tiny incision using small needles and wires . That decreases risks, pain, and recovery compared to open procedures . Real-time visualization also allows precision guidance to the abnormality, making the procedure or diagnosis more accurate.   These benefits are weighed against the additional risks of lack of immediate access to internal structures (should bleeding or a perforation occur), and the risks of radiation exposure such as cataracts and cancer. Interventional radiology is a set of techniques that allows access to the internal structures of the body through body orifices or very small incisions and guidance with medical imaging .  Regardless of the reason for the intervention, the procedure will likely use common elements such as a puncture needle (to pass through the skin), guidewires (to guide through structures such as blood vessels or the biliary or urinary systems), a sheath (which slides over the guidewire and hold the path open without injuring it), and catheters (that allow fluids to be pushed through them). [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lancet  The Lancet is a weekly peer-reviewed general medical journal . It is among the world's oldest and best-known general medical journals. [1] [2] It was founded in 1823 by Thomas Wakley , an English surgeon who named it after the surgical instrument called a lancet (scalpel). [3] The journal publishes original research articles, review articles ("seminars" and "reviews"), editorials , book reviews , correspondence, as well as news features and case reports . The Lancet has been owned by Elsevier since 1991, and its editor-in-chief since 1995 is Richard Horton . [4] The journal has editorial offices in London , New York , and Beijing . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_therapy Light therapy —or phototherapy , classically referred to as heliotherapy —consists either of exposure to daylight or some equivalent form of light as a treatment for seasonal affective disorder (SAD), or exposure of the skin to specific wavelengths of light using polychromatic polarised light to treat a skin condition. It is used as a treatment for wintertime seasonal affective disorder and in circadian rhythm disorders , such as delayed sleep phase disorder . [1] There is tentative evidence to support its use to treat non-seasonal psychiatric disorders , in particular major depression and depression in bipolar disorder . [2] [3] [4] As a treatment for disorders of the skin, the second kind of light therapy, called ultraviolet light therapy , is meant to correct psoriasis , acne vulgaris , eczema and neonatal jaundice . [5] [6] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liraglutide Liraglutide , sold under the brand name Victoza among others, is a medication used to treat diabetes mellitus type 2 and obesity . [1] In diabetes it is a less preferred agent compared to metformin . [1] [2] Its effects on long-term health outcomes like heart disease and life expectancy are unclear. [1] [3] It is given by injection under the skin . [1] Common side effects include low blood sugar , nausea, dizziness, abdominal pain, and pain at the site of injection. [1] Other serious side effects may include medullary thyroid cancer , angioedema , pancreatitis , gallbladder disease , and kidney problems . [1] Use in pregnancy and breastfeeding is of unclear safety. [1] Liraglutide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 receptor agonist) also known as incretin mimetics . [1] It works by increasing insulin release from the pancreas and decreases excessive glucagon release. [1] Liraglutide was approved for medical use in the European Union in 2009, and in the United States in 2010. [4] [5] In 2018, it was the 143rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 4 million prescriptions. [6] [7] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_medical_abbreviations 0–9 A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z Abbreviations are used very frequently in medicine. They boost efficiency as long as they are used intelligently. The advantages of brevity should be weighed against the possibilities of obfuscation (making the communication harder for others to understand) and ambiguity (having more than one possible interpretation). Certain medical abbreviations are avoided to prevent mistakes, according to best practices (and in some cases regulatory requirements); these are flagged in the list of abbreviations used in medical prescriptions . Periods (stops) are often used in styling abbreviations. Prevalent practice in medicine today is often to  forego them as unnecessary. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignant Malignancy (from Latin male 'badly', and -gnus 'born') is the tendency of a medical condition to become progressively worse. Malignancy is most familiar as a characterization of cancer . A malignant tumor contrasts with a non-cancerous benign tumor in that a malignancy is not self-limited in its growth, is capable of invading into adjacent tissues, and may be capable of spreading to distant tissues. A benign tumor has none of those properties. Malignancy in cancers is characterized by anaplasia , invasiveness, and metastasis . [4] Malignant tumors are also characterized by genome instability , so that cancers, as assessed by whole genome sequencing , frequently have between 10,000 and 100,000 mutations in their entire genomes. [5] Cancers usually show tumour heterogeneity , containing multiple subclones. [6] They also frequently have reduced expression of DNA repair enzymes due to epigenetic methylation of DNA repair genes or altered microRNAs that control DNA repair gene expression. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis Medical diagnosis (abbreviated Dx [1] or D S ) is the process of determining which disease or condition explains a person's symptoms and signs . It is most often referred to as diagnosis with the medical context being implicit. The information required for diagnosis is typically collected from a history and physical examination of the person seeking medical care. Often, one or more diagnostic procedures , such as medical tests , are also done during the process. Sometimes posthumous diagnosis is considered a kind of medical diagnosis. Diagnosis is often challenging, because many signs and symptoms are nonspecific , and can only be undertaken by registered and licensed health professionals. For example, redness of the skin ( erythema ), by itself, is a sign of many disorders and thus does not tell the healthcare professional what is wrong. Thus differential diagnosis , in which several possible explanations are compared and contrasted, must be performed. This involves the correlation of various pieces of information followed by the recognition and differentiation of patterns. Occasionally the process is made easy by a sign or symptom (or a group of several) that is pathognomonic . Diagnosis is a major component of the procedure of a doctor's visit . From the point of view of statistics , the diagnostic procedure involves classification tests . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ethics Medical ethics is an applied branch of ethics which analyzes the practice of clinical medicine and related scientific research. Medical ethics is based on a set of values that professionals can refer to in the case of any confusion or conflict. These values include the respect for autonomy , non-maleficence, beneficence , and justice . [1] Such tenets may allow doctors, care providers, and families to create a treatment plan and work towards the same common goal. [2] It is important to note that these four values are not ranked in order of importance or relevance and that they all encompass values pertaining to medical ethics. [3] However, a conflict may arise leading to the need for hierarchy in an ethical system, such that some moral elements overrule others with the purpose of applying the best moral judgement to a difficult medical situation. [4] Medical ethics is particularly relevant in decisions regarding involuntary treatment and involuntary commitment . There are several codes of conduct. The Hippocratic Oath discusses basic principles for medical professionals. [4] This document dates back to the fifth century BCE. [5] Both The Declaration of Helsinki (1964) and The Nuremberg Code (1947) are two well-known and well respected documents contributing to medical ethics. Other important markings in the history of medical ethics include Roe v. Wade in 1973 and the development of hemodialysis in the 1960s. More recently, new techniques for gene editing aiming at treating, preventing and curing diseases utilizing gene editing, are raising important moral questions about their applications in medicine and treatments as well as societal impacts on future generations. [6] As this field continues to develop and change throughout history, the focus remains on fair, balanced, and moral thinking across all cultural and religious backgrounds around the world. [7] [8] The field of medical ethics encompasses both practical application in clinical settings and scholarly work in philosophy , history , and sociology . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Medical_Journal_of_Australia The Medical Journal of Australia is a peer-reviewed medical journal published 22 times a year. It is the official journal of the Australian Medical Association , published by Wiley on behalf of the Australasian Medical Publishing Company. The journal publishes editorials, original research, guideline summaries, narrative reviews, perspectives, medical education, reflections, and letters. [1] The full text of every issue since January 2002 is available online. [2] The journal was established in 1856, when communication between Australian states and other English-speaking nations entailed long delays. [3] The journal was both a platform for Australian medical research, as well as educational reviews summarising research done overseas. It has since been renamed several times: [3] [4] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_microbiology Medical microbiology , the large subset of microbiology that is applied to medicine , is a branch of medical science concerned with the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases .  In addition, this field of science studies various clinical applications of microbes for the improvement of health.  There are four kinds of microorganisms that cause infectious disease: bacteria , fungi , parasites and viruses , and one type of infectious protein called prion . A medical microbiologist studies the characteristics of pathogens , their modes of transmission, mechanisms of infection and growth. The academic qualification as a clinical/Medical Microbiologist in a hospital or medical research centre generally requires a Masters in Microbiology along with Ph.D. in any of the life-sciences (Biochem, Micro, Biotech, Genetics, etc). [1] Using this information, a treatment can be devised.  Medical microbiologists often serve as consultants for physicians , providing identification of pathogens and suggesting treatment options. Other tasks may include the identification of potential health risks to the community or monitoring the evolution of potentially virulent or resistant strains of microbes, educating the community and assisting in the design of health practices.  They may also assist in preventing or controlling epidemics and outbreaks of disease. Not all medical microbiologists study microbial pathology ; some study common, non-pathogenic species to determine whether their properties can be used to develop antibiotics or other treatment methods. Epidemiology , the study of the patterns, causes, and effects of health and disease conditions in populations, is an important part of medical microbiology, although the clinical aspect of the field primarily focuses on the presence and growth of microbial infections in individuals, their effects on the human body, and the methods of treating those infections. In this respect the entire field, as an applied science, can be conceptually subdivided into academic and clinical sub-specialties, although in reality there is a fluid continuum between public health microbiology and clinical microbiology , just as the state of the art in clinical laboratories depends on continual improvements in academic medicine and research laboratories . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_Renaissance The Medical Renaissance , from around 1400 to 1700 CE , was a period of progress in European medical knowledge, with renewed interest in the ideas of the ancient Greek and Roman civilizations along with Arabic-Persian medicine , following the translation into Latin of many works from these societies. Medical discoveries during the Medical Renaissance are credited with paving the way for modern medicine. The Medical Renaissance began just as the original Renaissance did, in the early 16th century. Medical researchers continued their Renaissance-evoked practices into the late 17th century. [1] [2] Progress made during the Medical Renaissance depended on several factors. [3] [4] Printed books based on movable type , adopted in Europe from the middle of the 15th century, allowed the diffusion of medical ideas and anatomical diagrams. Linacre , Erasmus , Leonicello and Sylvius are among the list of the first scholars most credited for the starting of the Medical Renaissance. [2] Following after is Andreas Vesalius 's publication of De humani corporis fabrica (On the Fabric of the Human body) in 1543.  Better knowledge of the original writings of Galen in particular, developed into the learned medicine tradition through the more open attitudes of Renaissance humanism . Church control of the teachings of the medical profession and universities diminished, and dissection was more often possible.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_Subject_Headings Medical Subject Headings ( MeSH ) is a comprehensive controlled vocabulary for the purpose of indexing journal articles and books in the life sciences . It serves as a thesaurus that facilitates searching. Created and updated by the United States National Library of Medicine (NLM), it is used by the MEDLINE / PubMed article database and by NLM's catalog of book holdings. MeSH is also used by ClinicalTrials.gov registry to classify which diseases are studied by trials registered in ClinicalTrials. MeSH was introduced in the 1960s, with the NLM's own index catalogue and the subject headings of the Quarterly Cumulative Index Medicus (1940 edition) as precursors. The yearly printed version of MeSH was discontinued in 2007 and MeSH is now available online only. [2] It can be browsed and downloaded free of charge through PubMed. Originally in English, MeSH has been translated into numerous other languages and allows retrieval of documents from different origins. MeSH vocabulary is divided into four types of terms. The main ones are the "headings" (also known as MeSH headings or descriptors [2] ), which describe the subject of each article (e.g., "Body Weight", "Brain Edema" or "Critical Care Nursing"). Most of these are accompanied by a short description or definition, links to related descriptors, and a list of synonyms or very similar terms (known as entry terms ). MeSH contains approximately 27,000 entries and is updated annually to reflect changes in medicine and medical terminology. [3] MeSH terms are arranged in alphabetic order and in a hierarchical structure by subject categories with more specific terms arranged beneath broader terms. When we search for a MeSH term, the most specific MeSH terms are automatically included in the search. This is known as the extended search or explode of that MeSH term. This additional information and the hierarchical structure (see below) make the MeSH essentially a thesaurus , rather than a plain subject headings list. [4] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_tourism Medical tourism refers to people traveling abroad to obtain medical treatment. In the past, this usually referred to those who traveled from less-developed countries to major medical centers in highly developed countries for treatment unavailable at home. [1] [2] However, in recent years it may equally refer to those from developed countries who travel to developing countries for lower-priced medical treatments. The motivation may be also for medical services unavailable or non-licensed in the home country: There are differences between the medical agencies ( FDA , EMA etc.) world-wide, whether a drug is approved in their country or not. Even within Europe, although therapy protocols might be approved by the European Medical Agency (EMA), several countries have their own review organizations in order to evaluate whether the same therapy protocol would be "cost-effective", so that patients face differences in the therapy protocols, particularly in the access of these drugs, which might be partially explained by the financial strength of the particular Health System. Medical tourism most often is for surgeries (cosmetic or otherwise) or similar treatments, though people also travel for dental tourism or fertility tourism . [3] People with rare conditions may travel to countries where the treatment is better understood. However, almost all types of health care are available, including psychiatry , alternative medicine, convalescent care, and even burial services. Health tourism is a wider term for travel that focuses on medical treatments and the use of healthcare services. It covers a wide field of health-oriented tourism ranging from preventive and health-conductive treatment to rehabilitational and curative forms of travel. Wellness tourism is a related field. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MedlinePlus MedlinePlus is an online information service produced by the United States National Library of Medicine . The service provides curated consumer health information in English and Spanish with select content in additional languages. [1] [2] The site brings together information from the National Library of Medicine (NLM), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), other U.S. government agencies, and health-related organizations.  There is also a site optimized for display on mobile devices, in both English and Spanish. In 2015, about 400 million people from around the world used MedlinePlus. [3] The service is funded by the NLM and is free to users. MedlinePlus provides encyclopedic information on health and drug issues, and provides a directory of medical services. MedlinePlus Connect links patients or providers in electronic health record (EHR) systems to related MedlinePlus information on conditions or medications. PubMed Health [4] is another NLM site that offers consumer health information, in addition to information for health professionals. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_capacity Intelligence has been defined in many ways: the capacity for logic , understanding , self-awareness , learning , emotional knowledge , reasoning , planning , creativity , critical thinking , and problem-solving . More generally, it can be described as the ability to perceive or infer information , and to retain it as knowledge to be applied towards adaptive behaviors within an environment or context. Intelligence is most often studied in humans but has also been observed in both non-human animals and in plants despite controversy as to whether some of these forms of life exhibit intelligence. [1] [2] Intelligence in computers or other machines is called artificial intelligence . The word intelligence derives from the Latin nouns intelligentia or intellēctus , which in turn stem from the verb intelligere , to comprehend or perceive. In the Middle Ages , the word intellectus became the scholarly technical term for understanding, and a translation for the Greek philosophical term nous . This term, however, was strongly linked to the metaphysical and cosmological theories of teleological scholasticism , including theories of the immortality of the soul, and the concept of the active intellect (also known as the active intelligence). This approach to the study of nature was strongly rejected by the early modern philosophers such as Francis Bacon , Thomas Hobbes , John Locke , and David Hume , all of whom preferred "understanding" (in place of " intellectus " or "intelligence") in their English philosophical works. [3] [4] Hobbes for example, in his Latin De Corpore , used " intellectus intelligit ", translated in the English version as "the understanding understandeth", as a typical example of a logical absurdity . [5] "Intelligence" has therefore become less common in English language philosophy, but it has later been taken up (with the scholastic theories which it now implies) in more contemporary psychology . [6] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwife  A midwife is a health professional who cares for mothers and newborns around childbirth , a specialization known as midwifery . The education and training for a midwife concentrates extensively on the care of women throughout their lifespan; concentrating on being experts in what is normal and identifying conditions that need further evaluation. In most countries, midwives are recognized as skilled healthcare providers. Midwives are trained to recognize variations from the normal progress of labor and understand how to deal with deviations from normal. They may intervene in high risk situations such as breech births , twin births , and births where the baby is in a posterior position , using non-invasive techniques. For complications related to pregnancy and birth that are beyond the midwife's scope of practice , including surgical and instrumental deliveries, they refer their patients to physicians or surgeons. [3] [4] In many parts of the world, these professions work in tandem to provide care to childbearing women. In others, only the midwife is available to provide care, and in yet other countries, many women elect to utilize obstetricians primarily over midwives. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_Army_Surgical_Hospital The Mobile Army Surgical Hospital ( MASH ) refers to a United States Army medical unit serving as a fully functional hospital in a combat area of operations.  The units were first established in August 1945, and were deployed during the Korean War and later conflicts. The term was made famous in the novel, movie, and television series M*A*S*H , which depicted a fictional MASH unit. The U.S. Army deactivated the last MASH unit on February 16, 2006. The successor to the Mobile Army Surgical Hospital is the Combat Support Hospital . A precursor to MASH units, the American Expeditionary Force Mobile Hospital No.1 was established following the example of the French military automobile-chirurgical units shortly after the American entry to the war. [1] Principles for a mobile medical unit and their implementation were established through trial and error in the dental field during World War II by Major Vincent P. Marran, medic in Patton's Third Army. [2] The effectiveness of his efforts were widely admired and supported by the command structure, but no formal designation was established. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgue A morgue or mortuary (in a hospital or elsewhere) is a place used for the storage of human corpses awaiting identification or removal for autopsy or respectful burial , cremation or other method. In modern times, corpses have customarily been refrigerated to delay decomposition . [1] The term mortuary dates from the early 14th century, from Anglo-French mortuarie , meaning "gift to a parish priest from a deceased parishioner," from Medieval Latin mortuarium, noun use of neuter of Late Latin adjective mortuarius "pertaining to the dead," from Latin mortuus , pp. of mori "to die" (see mortal (adj.)). The meaning of "place where bodies are kept temporarily" was first recorded in 1865, as a euphemism for the earlier English term "deadhouse." The term morgue comes from the French morgue , which means 'to look at solemnly, to defy'. First used to describe the inner wicket of a prison , where new prisoners were kept so that jailers and turnkeys could recognize them in the future, it took on its modern meaning in fifteenth-century Paris , being used to describe part of the Châtelet used for the storage and identification of unknown corpses. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturopathy   Naturopathy or naturopathic medicine is a form of alternative medicine that employs an array of pseudoscientific practices branded as "natural", "non-invasive", or promoting "self-healing". The ideology and methods of naturopathy are based on vitalism and folk medicine , rather than evidence-based medicine (EBM). [2] Naturopathic practitioners generally recommend against following modern medical practices , including but not limited to medical testing , drugs , vaccinations , and surgery . [3] [4] [5] [6] Instead, naturopathic practice relies on unscientific notions, often leading naturopaths to diagnoses and treatments that have no factual merit. [7] [8] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_pharmacy An online pharmacy , internet pharmacy , or mail-order pharmacy is a pharmacy that operates over the Internet and sends orders to customers through mail, shipping companies, or online pharmacy web portal. Online pharmacies include: Conventional 'bricks and mortar' pharmacies usually have controlled drug distribution systems from the manufacturer, sufficient validation , and follow good distribution practices. Home delivery of pharmaceuticals can be a desirable convenience, but sometimes it can lead to problems with uncontrolled distribution. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid_crisis  The Opioid epidemic , also referred to as the opioid crisis , is the phrase used to describe the overuse, misuse/abuse, and overdose deaths, attributed either in part or in whole, by the class of drugs opiates/ opioids , and the significant medical, social, psychological, and economic consequences of both the medical and the non-medical or recreational use of these medications. Opioids are a diverse class of moderate to strong painkillers , including oxycodone (commonly sold under the trade names OxyContin and Percocet ), hydrocodone ( Vicodin , Norco ) and a very strong painkiller, fentanyl , which is synthesized to resemble other opiates such as opium -derived morphine and heroin . [1] The potency and availability of these substances, despite the potential risk of addiction and overdose, have made them popular both as medical treatments and as recreational drugs . Due to their sedative effects on the part of the brain which regulates breathing, the respiratory center of the medulla oblongata , opioids in high doses present the potential for respiratory depression and may cause respiratory failure and death . [2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_concentrator An oxygen concentrator is a device that concentrates the oxygen from a gas supply (typically ambient air) by selectively removing nitrogen to supply an oxygen-enriched product gas stream. Two methods in common use are pressure swing adsorption and membrane gas separation . Home medical oxygen concentrators were invented in the early 1970s, with the manufacturing output of these devices increasing in the late 1970s. Union Carbide Corporation and Bendix Corporation were both early manufacturers. Before that era, home medical oxygen therapy required the use of heavy high-pressure oxygen cylinders or small cryogenic liquid oxygen systems. Both of these delivery systems required frequent home visits by suppliers to replenish oxygen supplies. In the United States, Medicare switched from fee-for-service payment to a flat monthly rate for home oxygen therapy in the mid-1980s, causing the durable medical equipment (DME) industry to rapidly embrace concentrators as a way to control costs. This reimbursement change dramatically decreased the number of primary high pressure and liquid oxygen delivery systems in use in homes in the United States at that time. Oxygen concentrators became the preferred and most common means of delivering home oxygen. The number of manufacturers entering the oxygen concentrator market increased exponentially as a result of this change. Union Carbide Corporation invented the molecular sieve in the 1950s which made these devices possible.  It also invented the first cryogenic liquid home medical oxygen systems in the 1960s. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_therapy Oxygen therapy , also known as supplemental oxygen , is the use of oxygen as a medical treatment . [1] This can include for low blood oxygen , carbon monoxide toxicity , cluster headaches , and to maintain enough oxygen while inhaled anesthetics are given. [2] Long-term oxygen is often useful in people with chronically low oxygen such as from severe COPD or cystic fibrosis . [3] [1] Oxygen can be given in a number of ways including nasal cannula , face mask , and inside a hyperbaric chamber . [4] [5] Oxygen is required for normal cell metabolism . [6] Excessively high concentrations can cause oxygen toxicity such as lung damage or result in respiratory failure in those who are predisposed. [2] [7] Higher oxygen concentrations also increase the risk of fires, particularly while smoking, and without humidification can also dry out the nose. [1] The target oxygen saturation recommended depends on the condition being treated. [1] In most conditions a saturation of 94–96% is recommended, while in those at risk of carbon dioxide retention saturations of 88–92% are preferred, and in those with carbon monoxide toxicity or cardiac arrest they should be as high as possible. [1] [8] Air is typically 21% oxygen by volume while oxygen therapy increases this by some amount up to 100%. [7] The use of oxygen in medicine became common around 1917. [9] [10] It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines . [11] The cost of home oxygen is about US$150 a month in Brazil and US$400 a month in the United States. [3] Home oxygen can be provided either by oxygen tanks or an oxygen concentrator . [1] Oxygen is believed to be the most common treatment given in hospitals in the developed world . [12] [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient A patient is any recipient of health care services that are performed by healthcare professionals . The patient is most often ill or injured and in need of treatment by a physician , nurse , psychologist , dentist , veterinarian , or other health care provider . The word patient originally meant 'one who suffers'. This English noun comes from the Latin word patiens , the present participle of the deponent verb , patior , meaning 'I am suffering,' and akin to the Greek verb πάσχειν (= paskhein , to suffer) and its cognate noun πάθος (= pathos ).  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nerve_block Nerve block or regional nerve blockade is any deliberate interruption of signals traveling along a nerve, often for the purpose of pain relief. Local anesthetic nerve block (sometimes referred to as simply "nerve block") is a short-term block, usually lasting hours or days, involving the injection of an anesthetic, a corticosteroid , and other agents onto or near a nerve. Neurolytic block , the deliberate temporary degeneration of nerve fibers through the application of chemicals, heat, or freezing, produces a block that may persist for weeks, months, or indefinitely. Neurectomy , the cutting through or removal of a nerve or a section of a nerve, usually produces a permanent block. Because neurectomy of a sensory nerve is often followed, months later, by the emergence of new, more intense pain, sensory nerve neurectomy is rarely performed. The concept of nerve block sometimes includes central nerve block , which includes epidural and spinal anaesthesia . [1] Local anesthetic is often combined with other drugs to potentiate or prolong the analgesia produced by the nerve block. These adjuvants may include epinephrine , corticosteroids , opioids , ketamine , or alpha-adrenergic agonists . These blocks can be either single treatments, multiple injections over a period of time, or continuous infusions. A continuous peripheral nerve block can be introduced into a limb undergoing surgery – for example, a femoral nerve block to prevent pain in knee replacement . [2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacy Pharmacy is the clinical health science that links medical science with chemistry and it is charged with the discovery, production, disposal, safe and effective use, and control of medications and drugs . The practice of pharmacy requires excellent knowledge of drugs, their mechanism of action , side effects , interactions, mobility and toxicity . At the same time, it requires knowledge of treatment and understanding of the pathological process. Some specialties of pharmacists, such as that of clinical pharmacists , require other skills, e.g. knowledge about the acquisition and evaluation of physical and laboratory data. [1] The scope of pharmacy practice includes more traditional roles such as compounding and dispensing of medications, and it also includes more modern services related to health care , including clinical services, reviewing medications for safety and efficacy, and providing drug information. Pharmacists , therefore, are the experts on drug therapy and are the primary health professionals who optimize the use of medication for the benefit of the patients. An establishment in which pharmacy (in the first sense) is practiced is called a pharmacy (this term is more common in the United States) or a chemist's (which is more common in Great Britain, though pharmacy is also used) [ citation needed ] . In the United States and Canada, drugstores commonly sell medicines , as well as miscellaneous items such as confectionery , cosmetics , office supplies , toys , hair care products and magazines and occasionally refreshments and groceries. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_dependence Physical dependence is a physical condition caused by chronic use of a tolerance -forming drug, in which abrupt or gradual drug withdrawal causes unpleasant physical symptoms. [5] [6] Physical dependence can develop from low-dose therapeutic use of certain medications such as benzodiazepines, opioids, antiepileptics and antidepressants, as well as the recreational misuse of drugs such as alcohol, opioids and benzodiazepines. The higher the dose used, the greater the duration of use, and the earlier age use began are predictive of worsened physical dependence and thus more severe withdrawal syndromes. Acute withdrawal syndromes can last days, weeks or months. Protracted withdrawal syndrome, also known as post-acute-withdrawal syndrome or "PAWS", is a low-grade continuation of some of the symptoms of acute withdrawal, typically in a remitting-relapsing pattern, often resulting in relapse and prolonged disability of a degree to preclude the possibility of lawful employment. Protracted withdrawal syndrome can last for months, years, or depending on individual factors, indefinitely. Protracted withdrawal syndrome is noted to be most often caused by benzodiazepines . [7] To dispel the popular misassociation with addiction, physical dependence to medications is sometimes compared to dependence on insulin by persons with diabetes. [8] Physical dependence can manifest itself in the appearance of both physical and psychological symptoms which are caused by physiological adaptions in the central nervous system and the brain due to chronic exposure to a substance. Symptoms which may be experienced during withdrawal or reduction in dosage include increased heart rate and/or blood pressure, sweating, and tremors. [9] More serious withdrawal symptoms such as confusion , seizures , and visual hallucinations indicate a serious emergency and the need for immediate medical care. Sedative hypnotic drugs such as alcohol , benzodiazepines , and barbiturates are the only commonly available substances that can be fatal in withdrawal due to their propensity to induce withdrawal convulsions. Abrupt withdrawal from other drugs, such as opioids can cause an extremely painful withdrawal that is very rarely fatal in patients of general good health and with medical treatment, but is more often fatal in patients with weakened cardiovascular systems; toxicity is generally caused by the often-extreme increases in heart rate and blood pressure (which can be treated with clonidine ), or due to arrhythmia due to electrolyte imbalance caused by the inability to eat, and constant diarrhea and vomiting (which can be treated with loperamide and ondansetron respectively) associated with acute opioid withdrawal, especially in longer-acting substances where the diarrhea and emesis can continue unabated for weeks, although life-threatening complications are extremely rare, and nearly non-existent with proper medical management. Treatment for physical dependence depends upon the drug being withdrawn and often includes administration of another drug, especially for substances that can be dangerous when abruptly discontinued or when previous attempts have failed. [10] Physical dependence is usually managed by a slow dose reduction over a period of weeks, months or sometimes longer depending on the drug, dose and the individual. [7] A physical dependence on alcohol is often managed with a cross tolerant drug, such as long acting benzodiazepines to manage the alcohol withdrawal symptoms. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiotherapy  Physical therapy ( PT ), also known as physiotherapy , is one of the healthcare professions .  Physical therapy is provided by physical therapists who promote, maintain, or restore health through physical examination , diagnosis , prognosis, patient education , physical intervention, rehabilitation, disease prevention and health promotion . Physical therapists are known as physiotherapists in many countries. In addition to clinical practice, other aspects of physical therapist practice include research, education, consultation and health administration . Physical therapy is provided as a primary care treatment or alongside, or in conjunction with, other medical services. In some jurisdictions, such as the United Kingdom, physical therapists have the authority to prescribe medication. [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plague_doctor A Plague doctor was a physician who treated victims of the bubonic plague [1] during epidemics . These physicians were hired by cities to treat infected patients regardless of income, especially the poor that could not afford to pay. [2] Plague doctors are often depicted in Halloween costumes and seen as a symbol of death and disease. [3] Plague doctors had a mixed reputation, with some citizens seeing their presence as a warning to leave the area. [4] Some plague doctors were said to charge patients and their families additional fees for special treatments or false cures. [5] In many cases these "doctors" were not experienced physicians or surgeons ; instead, being volunteers, second-rate doctors, or young doctors just starting a career. [6] In one case, a plague doctor was a fruit salesman before his employment as a physician. Plague doctors rarely cured patients; instead serving to record death tolls and the number of infected people for demographic purposes. [4] In France and the Netherlands , plague doctors often lacked medical training and were referred to as " empirics ." Plague doctors were known as municipal or "community plague doctors", whereas "general practitioners" were separate doctors and both might be in the same European city or town at the same time. [1] [7] [8] [9] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plumpy%27nut Plumpy'Nut is a peanut -based paste in a plastic wrapper for treatment of severe acute malnutrition manufactured by Nutriset , a French company. [2] [3] Removing the need for hospitalization, the 92-gram (3¼ oz) packets of this paste can be administered at home and allow larger numbers to be treated. [2] Plumpy'Nut may be referred to in scientific literature as a Ready-to-Use Therapeutic Food (RUTF) alongside other RUTFs such as BP100. [4] Nutriset has been criticized by Médecins Sans Frontières for enforcing its Plumpy'nut patents. [5] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenatal_diagnosis Prenatal testing consists of prenatal screening and prenatal diagnosis , which are aspects of prenatal care that focus on detecting problems with the pregnancy as early as possible. [1] These may be anatomic and physiologic problems with the health of the zygote , embryo , or fetus , either before gestation even starts (as in preimplantation genetic diagnosis ) or as early in gestation as practicable. Screening can detect problems such as neural tube defects , chromosome abnormalities, and gene mutations that would lead to genetic disorders and birth defects , such as spina bifida , cleft palate , Downs Syndrome , Tay–Sachs disease , sickle cell anemia , thalassemia , cystic fibrosis , muscular dystrophy , and fragile X syndrome . Some tests are designed to discover problems which primarily affect the health of the mother, such as PAPP-A to detect pre-eclampsia or glucose tolerance tests to diagnose gestational diabetes . Screening can also detect anatomical defects such as hydrocephalus , anencephaly , heart defects , and amniotic band syndrome . Prenatal screening focuses on finding problems among a large population with affordable and noninvasive methods. Prenatal diagnosis focuses on pursuing additional detailed information once a particular problem has been found, and can sometimes be more invasive. The most common screening procedures are routine ultrasounds , blood tests, and blood pressure measurement. Common diagnosis procedures include amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling . In some cases, the tests are administered to determine if the foetus will be aborted , though physicians and patients also find it useful to diagnose high-risk pregnancies early so that delivery can be scheduled in a tertiary care hospital where the baby can receive appropriate care. There are three purposes of prenatal diagnosis: (1) to enable timely medical or surgical treatment of a condition before or after birth, (2) to give the parents the chance to abort a fetus with the diagnosed condition, and (3) to give parents the chance to prepare psychologically, socially, financially, and medically for a baby with a health problem or disability, or for the likelihood of a stillbirth. Prior information about problems in pregnancy means that healthcare staff as well as parents can better prepare themselves for the delivery of a child with a health problem. For example, Down Syndrome is associated with cardiac defects that may need intervention immediately upon birth. [2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis Prognosis ( Greek : πρόγνωσις "fore-knowing, foreseeing") is a medical term for predicting the likely or expected development of a disease, including whether the signs and symptoms will improve or worsen (and how quickly) or remain stable over time; expectations of quality of life, such as the ability to carry out daily activities; the potential for complications and associated health issues; and the likelihood of survival (including life expectancy). [1] [2] A prognosis is made on the basis of the normal course of the diagnosed disease, the individual's physical and mental condition, the available treatments, and additional factors. [2] A complete prognosis includes the expected duration, function, and description of the course of the disease, such as progressive decline, intermittent crisis, or sudden, unpredictable crisis. When applied to large statistical populations , prognostic estimates can be very accurate: for example the statement "45% of patients with severe septic shock will die within 28 days" can be made with some confidence, because previous research found that this proportion of patients died. This statistical information does not apply to the prognosis for each individual patient, because patient-specific factors can substantially change the expected course of the disease: additional information is needed to determine whether a patient belongs to the 45% who will die, or to the 55% who survive. [3] Prognostic scoring is also used for cancer outcome predictions. A Manchester score is an indicator of prognosis for small-cell lung cancer . For Non-Hodgkin lymphoma , physicians have developed the International Prognostic Index to predict patient outcome. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis Preventive healthcare , or prophylaxis , consists of measures taken for disease prevention. [1] Disease and disability are affected by environmental factors , genetic predisposition , disease agents, and lifestyle choices and are dynamic processes which begin before individuals realize they are affected. Disease prevention relies on anticipatory actions that can be categorized as primal, [2] [3] primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention. [1] Each year, millions of people die of preventable deaths. A 2004 study showed that about half of all deaths in the United States in 2000 were due to preventable behaviors and exposures. [4] Leading causes included cardiovascular disease , chronic respiratory disease , unintentional injuries, diabetes , and certain infectious diseases. [4] This same study estimates that 400,000 people die each year in the United States due to poor diet and a sedentary lifestyle . [4] According to estimates made by the World Health Organization (WHO), about 55 million people died worldwide in 2011, two thirds of this group from non-communicable diseases, including cancer , diabetes , and chronic cardiovascular and lung diseases . [5] This is an increase from the year 2000, during which 60% of deaths were attributed to these diseases. [5] Preventive healthcare is especially important given the worldwide rise in prevalence of chronic diseases and deaths from these diseases. There are many methods for prevention of disease. One of them is prevention of teenage smoking through information giving. [6] [7] [8] [9] It is recommended that adults and children aim to visit their doctor for regular check-ups, even if they feel healthy, to perform disease screening , identify risk factors for disease, discuss tips for a healthy and balanced lifestyle, stay up to date with immunizations and boosters, and maintain a good relationship with a healthcare provider. [10] In pediatrics, some common examples of primary prevention are encouraging parents to turn down the temperature of their home water heater in order to avoid scalding burns, encouraging children to wear bicycle helmets, and suggesting that people use the Air Quality Index (AQI) to check the level of pollution in the outside air before engaging in sporting activities.  Some common disease screenings include checking for hypertension (high blood pressure), hyperglycemia (high blood sugar, a risk factor for diabetes mellitus ), hypercholesterolemia (high blood cholesterol), screening for colon cancer , depression , HIV and other common types of sexually transmitted disease such as chlamydia , syphilis , and gonorrhea , mammography (to screen for breast cancer ), colorectal cancer screening, a Pap test (to check for cervical cancer ), and screening for osteoporosis . Genetic testing can also be performed to screen for mutations that cause genetic disorders or predisposition to certain diseases such as breast or ovarian cancer . [10] However, these measures are not affordable for every individual and the cost effectiveness of preventive healthcare is still a topic of debate. [11] [12] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoallergy A pseudoallergy is a condition named for its similar presentation to a true allergy , though due to different causes. [1] It may be due to alterations in the metabolism of histamine . [2] It can be the cause of some forms of food intolerance . [3] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopathology Psychopathology is the study of abnormal cognitions, behaviour and experiences which differs according to social norms and rests upon a number of constructs that are deemed to be the social norm at any particular era. It can be broadly separated into descriptive and explanatory. [1] Descriptive psychopathology involves categorizing, defining and understanding symptoms as reported by people and observed through their behavior which are then assessed according to a social norm. [1] Explanatory psychopathology looks to find explanations for certain kinds of symptoms according to theoretical models such as psychodynamics , cognitive behavioral therapy or through understanding how they have been constructed by drawing upon Constructivist Grounded Theory (Charmaz, 2016) or Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (Smith, Flowers & Larkin, 2013). [1] A practitioner in a clinical or academic field is referred to as a psychopathologist . Biological psychopathology is the study of the biological etiology of abnormal cognitions, behavior and experiences. Child psychopathology is a specialization applied to children and adolescents. Animal psychopathology is a specialization applied to non-human animals. This concept is linked to the philosophical ideas first outlined by Galton (1869) and is linked to the appliance of eugenical ideations around what constitutes the human. Early explanations for mental illnesses were influenced by religious belief and superstition . Psychological conditions that are now classified as mental disorders were initially attributed to possessions by evil spirits, demons, and the devil. This idea was widely accepted up until the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Individuals who suffered from these so-called "possessions" were tortured as treatment or as Foucault outlines in the History of Madness: viewed as seers (Joan of Arc). [ citation needed ] Religious practitioners used this technique in hoping to bring their patients back to sanity but increasingly there was the shift to the great confinement. [2] [ unreliable source? ] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health  Public health has been defined as "the science and art of preventing disease ”, prolonging life and improving quality of life through organized efforts and informed choices of society , organizations (public and private), communities and individuals . [1] Analyzing the determinants of health of a population and the threats it faces is the basis for public health. [2] The public can be as small as a handful of people or as large as a village or an entire city; in the case of a pandemic it may encompass several continents. The concept of health takes into account physical, psychological , and social well-being . As such, according to the World Health Organization , it is not merely the absence of disease or infirmity and more recently, a resource for everyday living. [3] Public health is an interdisciplinary field. For example, epidemiology , biostatistics , social sciences and management of health services are all relevant. Other important sub-fields include environmental health , community health , behavioral health , health economics , public policy , mental health , health education , health politics , occupational safety , disability , gender issues in health, and sexual and reproductive health . [4] Public health, together with primary care , secondary care, and tertiary care , is part of a country's overall health care system. Many interventions of public health interest are delivered outside of health facilities , such as food safety surveillance, distribution of condoms and needle-exchange programs for the prevention of transmissible diseases. Public health is not the same as public healthcare ( publicly funded health care ). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed  PubMed is a free search engine accessing primarily the MEDLINE database of references and abstracts on life sciences and biomedical topics. The United States National Library of Medicine (NLM) at the National Institutes of Health maintain the database as part of the Entrez system of information retrieval . [1] From 1971 to 1997, online access to the MEDLINE database had been primarily through institutional facilities, such as university libraries . [2] PubMed, first released in January 1996, ushered in the era of private, free, home- and office-based MEDLINE searching. [3] The PubMed system was offered free to the public starting in June 1997. [2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial A randomized controlled trial (or randomized control trial ; [2] RCT ) is a type of scientific experiment (e.g. a clinical trial ) or intervention study (as opposed to observational study ) that aims to reduce certain sources of bias when testing the effectiveness of new treatments; this is accomplished by randomly allocating subjects to two or more groups, treating them differently, and then comparing them with respect to a measured response. One group—the experimental group—receives the intervention being assessed, while the other—usually called the control group—receives an alternative treatment, such as a placebo or no intervention. The groups are monitored under conditions of the trial design to determine the effectiveness of the experimental intervention, and efficacy is assessed in comparison to the control. [3] There may be more than one treatment group or more than one control group . The trial may be blinded , meaning that information which may influence the participants is withheld until after the experiment is complete. A blind can be imposed on any participant of an experiment, including subjects, researchers, technicians, data analysts, and evaluators. Effective blinding may reduce or eliminate some sources of experimental bias . The randomness in the assignment of subjects to groups reduces selection bias and allocation bias, balancing both known and unknown prognostic factors, in the assignment of treatments. [4] Blinding reduces other forms of experimenter and subject biases . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction_Agostini Reaction Agostini is the name of a simplified examination for the presence of glucose in human urine. The method consists of preparing a solution of sodium chloride and potassium oxide , adding the urine to be investigated. If there is glucose present, the solution becomes red.

Founded by royal charter from King Henry VIII in 1518, the RCP is the oldest medical college in England. It set the first international standard in the classification of diseases, and its library contains medical texts of great historical interest. The college is sometimes referred to as the Royal College of Physicians of London to differentiate it from other similarly named bodies. The RCP drives improvements in health and healthcare through advocacy, education and research. Its 40,000 members work in hospitals and communities across over 30 medical specialties with around a fifth based in over 80 countries worldwide. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_(medicine)  Saline (also known as saline solution ) is a mixture of sodium chloride in water and has a number of uses in medicine. [1] Applied to the affected area it is used to clean wounds, help remove contact lenses , and help with dry eyes . [2] By injection into a vein it is used to treat dehydration such as from gastroenteritis and diabetic ketoacidosis . [2] [1] Large amounts may result in fluid overload , swelling , acidosis , and high blood sodium . [1] [2] In those with long-standing low blood sodium , excessive use may result in osmotic demyelination syndrome . [2] Saline is in the crystalloid family of medications. [3] It is most commonly used as a sterile 9 g of salt per litre (0.9%) solution, known as normal saline. [1] Higher and lower concentrations may also occasionally be used. [4] [5] Saline is acidic, with a pH of 5.5 (due mainly to dissolved carbon dioxide). [6] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septic_shock Septic shock is a potentially fatal medical condition that occurs when sepsis , which is organ injury or damage in response to infection , leads to dangerously low blood pressure and abnormalities in cellular metabolism. The Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3) defines septic shock as a subset of sepsis in which particularly profound circulatory, cellular, and metabolic abnormalities are associated with a greater risk of mortality than with sepsis alone. Patients with septic shock can be clinically identified by requiring  a vasopressor to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 65 mm Hg or greater and having serum lactate level greater than 2 mmol/L (>18 mg/dL) in the absence of hypovolemia . This combination is associated with hospital mortality rates greater than 40%. [1] The primary infection is most commonly caused by bacteria , but also may be by fungi , viruses or parasites . It may be located in any part of the body, but most commonly in the lungs, brain, urinary tract , skin or abdominal organs . [2] It can cause multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (formerly known as multiple organ failure) and death . [3] Frequently, people with septic shock are cared for in intensive care units . It most commonly affects children, immunocompromised individuals, and the elderly, as their immune systems cannot deal with infection as effectively as those of healthy adults. The mortality rate from septic shock is approximately 25–50%. [3] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_distancing  In public health, social distancing , also called physical distancing , [2] [3] [4] is a set of non-pharmaceutical interventions or measures intended to prevent the spread of a contagious disease by maintaining a physical distance between people and reducing the number of times people come into close contact with each other. [2] [5] It usually involves keeping a certain distance from others (the distance specified differs from country to country and can change with time) and avoiding gathering together in large groups. [6] [7] By minimising the probability that a given uninfected person will come into physical contact with an infected person, the disease transmission can be suppressed, resulting in fewer deaths . [2] The measures may be used in combination with others, such as good respiratory hygiene , face masks and hand washing . [8] [9] To slow down the spread of infectious diseases and avoid overburdening healthcare systems, particularly during a pandemic , several social-distancing measures are used, including the closing of schools and workplaces, isolation , quarantine , restricting the movement of people and the cancellation of mass gatherings . [5] [10] Drawbacks of social distancing can include loneliness , reduced productivity and the loss of other benefits associated with human interaction . [11] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_index The therapeutic index ( TI ; also referred to as therapeutic ratio ) is a quantitative measurement of the relative safety of a drug.  It is a comparison of the amount of a therapeutic agent that causes the therapeutic effect to the amount that causes toxicity. [1] The related terms therapeutic window or safety window refer to a range of doses which optimize between efficacy and toxicity, achieving the greatest therapeutic benefit without resulting in unacceptable side-effects or toxicity. Classically, in an established clinical indication setting of an approved drug, TI refers to the ratio of the dose of drug that causes adverse effects at an incidence/severity not compatible with the targeted indication (e.g. toxic dose in 50% of subjects, TD 50 ) to the dose that leads to the desired pharmacological effect (e.g. efficacious dose in 50% of subjects, ED 50 ). In contrast, in a drug development setting TI is calculated based on plasma exposure levels. [2] In the early days of pharmaceutical toxicology, TI was frequently determined in animals as lethal dose of a drug for 50% of the population ( LD 50 ) divided by the minimum effective dose for 50% of the population ( ED 50 ). Today, more sophisticated toxicity endpoints are used. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy A therapy or medical treatment (often abbreviated tx , Tx , or T x ) is the attempted remediation of a health problem, usually following a medical diagnosis . As a rule, each therapy has indications and contraindications .  There are many different types of therapy.  Not all therapies are effective .  Many therapies can produce unwanted adverse effects . Treatment and therapy are generally considered synonyms.  However,  in the context of mental health , the term therapy may refer specifically to psychotherapy . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_medicine  Traditional Chinese medicine ( TCM ) is a branch of traditional medicine in China. It has been described as "fraught with pseudoscience ", and the majority of its treatments as having no logical mechanism of action . [1] TCM is said to be based on Compendium of Materia Medica and Huangdi Neijing . The practice includes various forms of herbal medicine , acupuncture , cupping therapy , gua sha , massage (tui na) , bonesetter (die-da) , exercise (qigong) , and dietary therapy. [2] TCM is widely used in the Sinosphere , [2] [3] [4] [5] where it has a long history; subsequently it is now also practiced outside of China. [2] [6] One of the basic tenets of TCM is that the body's vital energy ( ch'i or qi ) is circulating through channels called meridians having branches connected to bodily organs and functions. [7] The concept of vital energy is pseudoscientific. Concepts of the body and of disease used in TCM reflect its ancient origins and its emphasis on dynamic processes over material structure, similar to the humoral theory of Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome . [8] The use of traditional medicine in China has been a major generator of illegal wildlife smuggling , linked to the killing and smuggling of endangered animals and the primary consumer of the illegal ivory trade . The trade being a major factor for endangering species leading to extinction of biodiversity collapse in many places of the world. [9] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_medicine Traditional medicine (also known as indigenous or folk medicine ) comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within the folk beliefs of various societies before the era of modern medicine . The World Health Organization (WHO) defines traditional medicine as "the sum total of the knowledge, skills, and practices based on the theories, beliefs, and experiences indigenous to different cultures, whether explicable or not, used in the maintenance of health as well as in the prevention, diagnosis, improvement or treatment of physical and mental illness". [1] Traditional medicine is contrasted with scientific medicine . In some Asian and African countries, up to 80% of the population relies on traditional medicine for their primary health care needs.  When adopted outside its traditional culture, traditional medicine is often considered a form of alternative medicine . [1] Practices known as traditional medicines include traditional European medicine, traditional Chinese medicine , traditional indigenous Mayongia magic and medicine(Assam), traditional indigenous medicine of Assam and rest of NE India, nattuvaidyam (indigenous medicine practised in south India), traditional Korean medicine , traditional African medicine , Ayurveda , Siddha medicine , Unani , ancient Iranian Medicine , Iranian (Persian) , Islamic medicine , Muti , and Ifá . Scientific disciplines which study traditional medicine include herbalism , ethnomedicine , ethnobotany , and medical anthropology . The WHO notes, however, that "inappropriate use of traditional medicines or practices can have negative or dangerous effects" and that " further research is needed to ascertain the efficacy and safety" of such practices and medicinal plants used by traditional medicine systems. [1] As a result, the WHO has implemented a nine-year strategy to "support Member States in developing proactive policies and implementing action plans that will strengthen the role traditional medicine plays in keeping populations healthy."

Consisting of eight separate campuses, it is mainly located in the cities of Versailles , Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines , Mantes-en-Yvelines and Vélizy-Villacoublay / Rambouillet . It is one of the five universities of the Academy of Versailles . [n 1] Versailles Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines University is a constituent university of the federal Paris-Saclay University . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinary_medicine Veterinary medicine is the branch of medicine that deals with the prevention, control, diagnosis, and treatment of disease, disorder, and injury in animals . Along with this, it deals with animal rearing, husbandry, breeding, research on nutrition, and product development. The scope of veterinary medicine is wide, covering all animal species, both domesticated and wild , with a wide range of conditions that can affect different species. Veterinary medicine is widely practiced, both with and without professional supervision. Professional care is most often led by a veterinary physician (also known as a veterinarian, veterinary surgeon, or "vet"), but also by paraveterinary workers , such as veterinary nurses or technicians.  This can be augmented by other paraprofessionals with specific specialties, such as animal physiotherapy or dentistry , and species-relevant roles such as farriers . Veterinary science helps human health through the monitoring and control of zoonotic disease ( infectious disease transmitted from nonhuman animals to humans), food safety, and indirectly through human applications from basic medical research. They also help to maintain food supply through livestock health monitoring and treatment, and mental health by keeping pets healthy and long-living. Veterinary scientists often collaborate with epidemiologists and other health or natural scientists, depending on type of work. Ethically, veterinarians are usually obliged to look after animal welfare. Veterinarians diagnose, treat, and help keep animals safe and healthy. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain  Pain is a distressing feeling often caused by intense or damaging stimuli. The International Association for the Study of Pain defines pain as "an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with, or resembling that associated with, actual or potential tissue damage." [1] In medical diagnosis, pain is regarded as a symptom of an underlying condition. Pain motivates the individual to withdraw from damaging situations, to protect a damaged body part while it heals, and to avoid similar experiences in the future. [2] Most pain resolves once the noxious stimulus is removed and the body has healed, but it may persist despite removal of the stimulus and apparent healing of the body. Sometimes pain arises in the absence of any detectable stimulus, damage or disease. [3] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_pain  Abdominal pain , also known as a stomach ache , is a symptom associated with both non-serious and serious medical issues. Common causes of pain in the abdomen include gastroenteritis and irritable bowel syndrome . [2] About 15% of people have a more serious underlying condition such as appendicitis , leaking or ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm , diverticulitis , or ectopic pregnancy . [2] In a third of cases the exact cause is unclear. [2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthetic  An anesthetic ( American English ) or anaesthetic ( British English ; see spelling differences ) is a drug used to induce anesthesia ⁠— ⁠in other words, to result in a temporary loss of sensation or awareness . They may be divided into two broad classes: general anesthetics , which result in a reversible loss of consciousness , and local anesthetics , which cause a reversible loss of sensation for a limited region of the body without necessarily affecting consciousness. A wide variety of drugs are used in modern anesthetic practice.  Many are rarely used outside anesthesiology , but others are used commonly in various fields of healthcare. Combinations of anesthetics are sometimes used for their synergistic and additive therapeutic effects. Adverse effects, however, may also be increased. [1] Anesthetics are distinct from analgesics , which block only sensation of painful stimuli. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibromyalgia  Fibromyalgia ( FM ) is a medical condition characterized by chronic widespread pain and a heightened pain response to pressure . [3] Other symptoms include tiredness to a degree that normal activities are affected, sleep problems and troubles with memory . [4] Some people also report restless legs syndrome , bowel or bladder problems , numbness and tingling and sensitivity to noise, lights or temperature. [5] Fibromyalgia is frequently associated with depression , anxiety and posttraumatic stress disorder . [4] Other types of chronic pain are also frequently present. [4] The cause of fibromyalgia is unknown; however, it is believed to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors. [4] [5] The condition runs in families and many genes are believed to be involved. [8] Environmental factors may include psychological stress , trauma , and certain infections . [4] The pain appears to result from processes in the central nervous system and the condition is referred to as a "central sensitization syndrome". [3] [4] Fibromyalgia is recognized as a disorder in both the U.S. by the US National Institutes of Health and the American College of Rheumatology , [5] [9] and in Canada by the Canadian Rheumatology Association and the Canadian Pain Society. [10] There is no specific diagnostic test, [5] although as of 2020, several diagnostic blood tests were in the process of moving towards certification and wider use for diagnosing fibromyalgia in conjunction with a physical examination. [11] [12] Nonetheless, all forms of diagnosis involve first ruling out other potential causes and verifying that a set number of symptoms are present. [4] [5] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headache Headache is the symptom of pain in the face , head , or neck . It can occur as a migraine , tension-type headache , or cluster headache . There is an increased risk of depression in those with severe headaches. [1] Headaches can occur as a result of many conditions. There are a number of different classification systems for headaches. The most well-recognized is that of the International Headache Society . Causes of headaches may include dehydration, fatigue, sleep deprivation, stress, the effects of medications, the effects of recreational drugs, viral infections, loud noises, common colds, head injury, rapid ingestion of a very cold food or beverage, and dental or sinus issues (such as sinusitis ). [2] Treatment of a headache depends on the underlying cause, but commonly involves pain medication . A headache is one of the most commonly experienced of all physical discomforts. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstitial_cystitis  Interstitial cystitis ( IC ), also known as bladder pain syndrome ( BPS ), is a type of chronic pain that affects the bladder and pelvic floor. [1] Together with CP/CPPS , it makes up urologic chronic pelvic pain syndrome (UCPPS) . [2] Symptoms include feeling the need to urinate right away , needing to urinate often , and pain with sex . [1] IC/BPS is associated with depression and lower quality of life . [5] Many of those affected also have irritable bowel syndrome and fibromyalgia . [1] The cause of IC/BPS is unknown. [1] While it can, it does not typically run in a family. [1] The diagnosis is usually based on the symptoms after ruling out other conditions . [5] Typically the urine culture is negative. [5] Ulceration or inflammation may be seen on cystoscopy . [5] Other conditions which can produce similar symptoms include urinary tract infection (UTI), overactive bladder , sexually transmitted infections , endometriosis , bladder cancer , and prostatitis . [1] [6] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migraine  Migraine ( UK : / ˈ m iː ɡ r eɪ n / , US : / ˈ m aɪ -/ ) [12] [13] is a primary headache disorder characterized by recurrent headaches that are moderate to severe. [1] Typically, episodes affect one side of the head, are pulsating in nature, and last from a few hours to three days. [1] Associated symptoms may include nausea , vomiting , and sensitivity to light , sound , or smell . [2] The pain is generally made worse by physical activity, [14] although regular exercise may have prophylactic effects. [15] Up to one-third of people affected have aura : typically a short period of visual disturbance that signals that the headache will soon occur. [14] Occasionally, aura can occur with little or no headache following, but not everyone has this symptom. [16] Migraine is believed to be due to a mixture of environmental and genetic factors. [3] About two-thirds of cases run in families. [5] Changing hormone levels may also play a role, as migraine affects slightly more boys than girls before puberty and two to three times more women than men. [4] [17] The risk of migraine usually decreases during pregnancy and after menopause . [4] [18] The underlying mechanisms are not fully known. [18] They are, however, believed to involve the nerves and blood vessels of the brain. [5] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myalgia Myalgia (also called muscle pain and muscle ache ) is the medical term for muscle pain .  Myalgia is a symptom of many diseases . The most common cause of acute myalgia is the overuse of a muscle or group of muscles; another likely cause is viral infection , especially when there has been no trauma. Long-lasting myalgia can be caused by metabolic myopathy , some nutritional deficiencies, and chronic fatigue syndrome . The most common causes of myalgia are overuse , injury , or strain . However, myalgia can also be caused by diseases, medications, or as a response to a vaccination . Dehydration at times results in muscle pain as well, for people involved in extensive physical activities such as workout. It is also a sign of acute rejection after heart transplant surgery. The most common causes are: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck_pain Neck pain , also known as cervicalgia , is a common problem, with two-thirds of the population having neck pain at some point in their lives. [1] Neck pain, although felt in the neck , can be caused by numerous other spinal problems. Neck pain may arise due to muscular tightness in both the neck and upper back, or pinching of the nerves emanating from the cervical vertebrae . Joint disruption in the neck creates pain, as does joint disruption in the upper back. The head is supported by the lower neck and upper back, and it is these areas that commonly cause neck pain. The top three joints in the neck allow for most movement of the neck and head. The lower joints in the neck and those of the upper back create a supportive structure for the head to sit on. If this support system is affected adversely, then the muscles in the area will tighten, leading to neck pain. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_disorder Pain disorder is chronic pain experienced by a patient in one or more areas, and is thought to be caused by psychological stress . The pain is often so severe that it disables the patient from proper functioning. Duration may be as short as a few days or as long as many years. The disorder may begin at any age, and occurs more frequently in girls than boys. [1] This disorder often occurs after an accident, during an illness that has caused pain, or after withdrawing from use during drug addiction, which then takes on a 'life' of its own. [2] Common symptoms of pain disorder are: negative or distorted cognition, such as feelings of despair or hopelessness; inactivity and passivity, in some cases disability; increased pain, sometimes requiring clinical treatment; sleep disturbance and fatigue; disruption of social relationships; depression and anxiety. [3] Acute conditions last less than six months while chronic pain disorder lasts six or more months. [4] There is no neurological or physiological basis for the pain. Pain is reported as more distressing than it should be had there been a physical explanation. Pain behavior highlights the psychological aspect of pain disorder. This can be demonstrated how moderate pain symptoms become more painful when rewarded in the form of solicitous and attentive behavior of others, by monetary gain, or by the successful avoidance of distasteful activities. [5] The same can be said about excessive worry. A minor physical symptom can be aggravated or become more harmful and threatening if the person suffering engages in a constant body and symptom appraisal, which can lead to stress and maladaptive behavior when coping with the physical symptom. [6] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sore_throat Sore throat , also known as throat pain , is pain or irritation of the throat . Sore throat is usually caused by a viral infection or a group A streptococcus (GAS) bacterial infection. [1] Other causes include pharyngitis ( inflammation of the throat), tonsillitis (inflammation of the tonsils), or dehydration , which leads to the throat drying up. It can also result from trauma . The majority of sore throats are caused by a virus, for which antibiotics are not helpful. [1] A strong association between antibiotic misuse and antibiotic resistance has been shown. [2] For sore throat caused by bacteria (GAS), treatment with antibiotics may help the person get better faster, reduce the risk that the bacterial infection does not spread, prevent retropharyngeal abscesses and quinsy , and reduce the risk of other complications such as rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease . [1] In most developed countries , post-streptococcal diseases have become far less common. For this reason, awareness and public health initiatives to promote minimizing the use of antibiotics for viral infections has become the focus. [1] Approximately 35% of childhood sore throats and 5-25% of adults sore throats are caused by a bacterial infection from group A streptococcus. [1] Sore throats that are "non-group A streptococcus" are assumed to be caused by a viral infection. Sore throat is a common reason for people to visit their primary care doctors and the top reason for antibiotic prescriptions by primary care practitioners such as family doctors. [1] In the United States, about 1% of all visits to the hospital emergency department, physician office and medical clinics, and outpatient clinics are for sore throat (over 7 million visits for adults and 7 million visits for children per year). [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering Suffering , or pain in a broad sense, [1] may be an experience of unpleasantness and aversion associated with the perception of harm or threat of harm in an individual. [2] Suffering is the basic element that makes up the negative valence of affective phenomena . The opposite of suffering is pleasure or happiness . Suffering is often categorized as physical [3] or mental. [4] It may come in all degrees of intensity, from mild to intolerable. Factors of duration and frequency of occurrence usually compound that of intensity. Attitudes toward suffering may vary widely, in the sufferer or other people, according to how much it is regarded as avoidable or unavoidable, useful or useless, deserved or undeserved. Suffering occurs in the lives of sentient beings in numerous manners, often dramatically. As a result, many fields of human activity are concerned with some aspects of suffering. These aspects may include the nature of suffering, its processes, its origin and causes, its meaning and significance, its related personal, social, and cultural behaviors, [5] its remedies, management, and uses. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tension_headache Tension headache , also known as stress headache , or tension-type headache (TTH), is the most common type of primary headache . The pain can radiate from the lower back of the head, the neck, eyes or other muscle groups in the body typically affecting both sides of the head. Tension-type headaches account for nearly 90% of all headaches. Pain medication, such as aspirin and ibuprofen , are effective for the treatment of tension headache. [1] [2] Tricyclic antidepressants appear to be useful for prevention. [3] Evidence is poor for SSRIs , propranolol and muscle relaxants . [4] [5] As of 2016, tension headaches affect about 1.89 billion people [6] and are more common in women than men (23% to 18% respectively). [7] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toothache  Toothache , also known as dental pain , [3] is pain in the teeth or their supporting structures, caused by dental diseases or pain referred to the teeth by non-dental diseases. When severe it may impact sleep, eating, and other daily activities. Common causes include inflammation of the pulp , (usually in response to tooth decay , dental trauma , or other factors), dentin hypersensitivity , apical periodontitis (inflammation of the periodontal ligament and alveolar bone around the root apex), dental abscesses (localized collections of pus ), alveolar osteitis ("dry socket", a possible complication of tooth extraction ), acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (a gum infection), and temporomandibular disorder . [4] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom Signs and symptoms are the observed or detectable signs, and experienced symptoms of an illness,  injury, or condition.  A sign for example may be a higher or lower temperature than normal,  raised or lowered blood pressure or an abnormality showing on a medical scan .  A  symptom is something out of the ordinary that is experienced by an individual such as feeling feverish, a headache  or other pain or pains in the body. [1] [2] A medical sign is an objective indication of a disease, injury, or abnormal physiological state that may be detected during a physical examination . [3] These signs are visible or otherwise detectable such as a rash or bruise . Medical signs assist in arriving at an accurate diagnosis . Examples of signs include elevated blood pressure , nail clubbing of the fingernails or toenails, staggering gait , and arcus senilis and arcus juvenilis of the eyes. A sign is distinguished from an indication which is a specific reason for using a particular treatment . A symptom is something felt or experienced, such as pain or dizziness. Signs and symptoms are not mutually exclusive, for example a subjective feeling of fever can be noted as sign by using a thermometer that registers a high reading. [4] Signs and symptoms are often non-specific, but some combinations can be suggestive of certain diagnoses , helping to narrow down what may be wrong. A particular set of characteristic signs and symptoms that may be associated with a disorder is known as a syndrome . In cases where the underlying cause is known the syndrome is named as for example Down syndrome and Noonan syndrome . Other syndromes such as acute coronary syndrome may have a number of possible causes. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom Signs and symptoms are the observed or detectable signs, and experienced symptoms of an illness,  injury, or condition.

Other syndromes such as acute coronary syndrome may have a number of possible causes. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesia  Amnesia is a deficit in memory caused by brain damage or disease, [1] but it can also be caused temporarily by the use of various sedatives and hypnotic drugs . The memory can be either wholly or partially lost due to the extent of damage that was caused. [2] There are two main types of amnesia: retrograde amnesia and anterograde amnesia . Retrograde amnesia is the inability to retrieve information that was acquired before a particular date, usually the date of an accident or operation. [3] In some cases the memory loss can extend back decades, while in others the person may lose only a few months of memory. Anterograde amnesia is the inability to transfer new information from the short-term store into the long-term store. People with anterograde amnesia cannot remember things for long periods of time. These two types are not mutually exclusive; both can occur simultaneously. [4] Case studies also show that amnesia is typically associated with damage to the medial temporal lobe . In addition, specific areas of the hippocampus (the CA1 region ) are involved with memory. Research has also shown that when areas of the diencephalon are damaged, amnesia can occur. Recent studies have shown a correlation between deficiency of RbAp48 protein and memory loss . Scientists were able to find that mice with damaged memory have a lower level of RbAp48 protein compared to normal, healthy mice. [5] [6] In people suffering with amnesia, the ability to recall immediate information is still retained, [7] [8] [ full citation needed ] [ better source needed ] and they may still be able to form new memories. However, a severe reduction in the ability to learn new material and retrieve old information can be observed. Patients can learn new procedural knowledge. In addition, priming (both perceptual and conceptual) can assist amnesiacs in the learning of fresh non-declarative knowledge. [1] Amnesic patients also retain substantial intellectual, linguistic, and social skill despite profound impairments in the ability to recall specific information encountered in prior learning episodes. [9] [10] [11] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anhedonia  Anhedonia is a diverse array of deficits in hedonic function, including reduced motivation or ability to experience pleasure. [1] While earlier definitions emphasized the inability to experience pleasure, anhedonia is currently used by researchers to refer to reduced motivation, reduced anticipatory pleasure (wanting), reduced consummatory pleasure (liking), and deficits in reinforcement learning. [2] [3] [4] In the DSM-5 , anhedonia is a component of depressive disorders, substance-related disorders, psychotic disorders, and personality disorders, where it is defined by either a reduced ability to experience pleasure, or a diminished interest in engaging in pleasurable activities. [5] [6] While the ICD-10 does not explicitly mention anhedonia, the depressive symptom analogous to anhedonia as described in the DSM-V is a loss of interest or pleasure. [3] While anhedonia was originally defined in 1896 by Théodule-Armand Ribot as the reduced ability to experience pleasure, it has been used to refer to deficits in multiple facets of reward.  Re-conceptualizations of anhedonia highlight the independence of "wanting" and "liking".  "Wanting" is a component of anticipatory positive affect, mediating both the motivation (i.e. incentive salience) to engage with reward, as well as the positive emotions associated with anticipating a reward.  "Liking", on the other hand, is associated with the pleasure derived from consuming a reward. [2] [1] The consciousness of reward-related processes has also been used to categorize reward in the context of anhedonia, as studies comparing implicit behavior versus explicit self-reports demonstrate a dissociation of the two. [7] Learning has also been proposed as an independent facet of reward that may be impaired in conditions associated with anhedonia, but empirical evidence dissociating learning from either "liking" or "wanting" is lacking. [7] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anosmia Anosmia , also known as smell blindness , is the loss of the ability to detect one or more smells . [1] [2] Anosmia may be temporary or permanent. [3] It differs from hyposmia , which is a decreased sensitivity to some or all smells. [2] Anosmia can be due to a number of factors, including an inflammation of the nasal mucosa , blockage of nasal passages or a destruction of one temporal lobe . Inflammation is due to chronic mucosa changes in the lining of the paranasal sinus and in the middle and superior turbinates . When anosmia is caused by inflammatory changes in the nasal passageways, it is treated simply by reducing inflammation. [4] It can be caused by chronic meningitis and neurosyphilis that would increase intracranial pressure over a long period of time, [5] and in some cases by ciliopathy , [6] including ciliopathy due to primary ciliary dyskinesia . [7] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aura_(symptom) An aura is a perceptual disturbance experienced by some with epilepsy or migraine . An epileptic aura is in fact a seizure. [1] Epileptic and migraine auras are due to the involvement of specific areas of the brain, which are those that determine the symptoms of the aura. Therefore, if the visual area is affected, the aura will consist of visual symptoms, while if a sensory one, then sensory symptoms will occur. Epileptic auras are subjective sensory or psychic phenomena due to a focal seizure, i.e. a seizure that originates from that area of the brain responsible for the function which then expresses itself with the symptoms of the aura. It is important because it makes it clear where the alteration causing the seizure is located. An epileptic aura is in most cases followed by other manifestations of a seizure, for example a convulsion, since the epileptic discharge spreads to other parts of the brain. Rarely it remains isolated. Auras, when they occur, allow some people who have epilepsy time to prevent injury to themselves and/or others when they lose consciousness. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_behaviour Automatic behavior , from the Greek automatos or self-acting, is the spontaneous production of often purposeless verbal or motor behavior without conscious self-control or self-censorship . This condition can be observed in a variety of contexts, including schizophrenia , psychogenic fugue , epilepsy (in complex partial seizures and Jacksonian seizures ), narcolepsy or in response to a traumatic event . The individual does not recall the behavior. According to the book 'The Mind Machine' by Colin Blakemore , hypoglycemia usually leads quickly to unconsciousness, but as blood glucose level falls, there is 'a window of experience between sanity and coma in which self-control is lost', and the body 'behaves on its own'. Automatic behavior can also be exhibited whilst in the REM state—subjects can hold conversations, sit up and even open their eyes. Those acts are considered sub-conscious as most of the time the events cannot be recalled by the subject. It is most common when the subject has had under 10 hours sleep within a 36-hour period. [ citation needed ]  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bibliomania Bibliomania can be a symptom of obsessive–compulsive disorder which involves the collecting or even hoarding of books to the point where social relations or health are damaged. Bibliomania is not to be confused with bibliophilia , which is the (psychologically healthy) love of books, and as such is not considered a clinical psychological disorder. One of several unusual behaviors associated with books, bibliomania is characterized by the collecting of books which have no use to the collector nor any great intrinsic value to a genuine book collector. The purchase of multiple copies of the same book and edition and the accumulation of books beyond possible capacity of use or enjoyment are frequent symptoms of bibliomania. [1] Bibliomania is not a psychological disorder recognized by the American Psychiatric Association in its DSM-IV. [2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blunt_trauma Blunt trauma , also known as blunt force trauma or non-penetrating trauma , is physical trauma or impactful force to a body part, often occurring with road traffic collisions , direct blows, assaults , injuries during sports , and particularly in the elderly who fall . [1] [2] It is contrasted with penetrating trauma which occurs when an object pierces the skin and enters a tissue of the body, creating an open wound and bruise . [3] Blunt trauma can result in contusions , abrasions , lacerations , internal hemorrhages , and bone fractures . [1] Worldwide, a significant cause of disability and death in people under the age of 35 years is trauma, of which most are due to blunt trauma. [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalepsy Catalepsy (from Ancient Greek katálēpsis , κατάληψις , "seizing, grasping") is a nervous condition characterized by muscular rigidity and fixity of posture regardless of external stimuli, as well as decreased sensitivity to pain . [1] Symptoms include a rigid body, rigid limbs, limbs staying in same position when moved ( waxy flexibility ), no response, loss of muscle control, and slowing down of bodily functions, such as breathing. [2] Catalepsy is a symptom of certain nervous disorders or conditions such as Parkinson's disease and epilepsy . It is also a characteristic symptom of cocaine withdrawal, as well as one of the features of catatonia . [ citation needed ] It can be caused by schizophrenia treatment with anti-psychotics , [3] such as haloperidol , [4] and by the anesthetic ketamine . [5] Protein kinase A has been suggested as a mediator of cataleptic behavior. [6] Unsuggested waxy catalepsy, sometimes accompanied by spontaneous anesthesia, is seen as an indicator of hypnotic trance. [7] Suggested or induced rigid catalepsy, of extended limbs or even the entire body, sometimes tested with heavy weights, has been a staple of stage hypnosis shows and even academic demonstrations of hypnotism since the late 18th century, as proof of extraordinary physical abilities possible in trance states. [ citation needed ] Such demonstrations have also been performed by Asian martial artists to prove the presence of "ki" or "chi" power, a kind of psychological or spiritual resource. [ citation needed ] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chorea Chorea (or choreia , occasionally) is an abnormal involuntary movement disorder , one of a group of neurological disorders called dyskinesias . The term chorea is derived from the Ancient Greek : χορεία ("dance"; see choreia ), as the quick movements of the feet or hands are comparable to dancing. The term hemichorea refers to chorea of one side of the body, such as chorea of one arm but not both (analogous to hemiballismus ). Chorea is characterized by brief, semi-directed, irregular movements that are not repetitive or rhythmic, but appear to flow from one muscle to the next. These 'dance-like' movements of chorea often occur with athetosis , which adds twisting and writhing movements. Walking may become difficult, and include odd postures and leg movements. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coma A coma is a deep state of prolonged unconsciousness in which a person cannot be awakened, fails to respond normally to painful stimuli, light, or sound, lacks a normal wake-sleep cycle and does not initiate voluntary actions. [2] Coma patients exhibit a complete absence of wakefulness and are unable to consciously feel, speak or move. [3] Comas can be derived by natural causes, or can be medically induced . Clinically, a coma can be defined as the inability consistently to follow a one-step command. [4] It can also be defined as a score of ≤ 8 on the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) lasting ≥ 6 hours. For a patient to maintain consciousness, the components of wakefulness and awareness must be maintained. Wakefulness describes the quantitative degree of consciousness , whereas awareness relates to the qualitative aspects of the functions mediated by the cortex, including cognitive abilities such as attention, sensory perception, explicit memory, language, the execution of tasks, temporal and spatial orientation and reality judgment. [3] [5] From a neurological perspective, consciousness is maintained by the activation of the cerebral cortex —the gray matter that forms the outer layer of the brain and by the reticular activating system (RAS), a structure located within the brainstem . [6] [7] The term 'coma', from the Greek κῶμα koma , meaning deep sleep, had already been used in the Hippocratic corpus ( Epidemica ) and later by Galen (second century AD). Subsequently, it was hardly used in the known literature up to the middle of the 17th century. The term is found again in Thomas Willis ' (1621–1675) influential De anima brutorum (1672), where lethargy (pathological sleep), 'coma' (heavy sleeping), carus (deprivation of the senses) and apoplexy (into which carus could turn and which he localized in the white matter ) are mentioned. The term carus is also derived from Greek, where it can be found in the roots of several words meaning soporific or sleepy. It can still be found in the root of the term 'carotid'. Thomas Sydenham (1624–89) mentioned the term 'coma' in several cases of fever (Sydenham, 1685). [8] [9] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cough A cough is a sudden expulsion of air through the large breathing passages that can help clear them of fluids, irritants, foreign particles and microbes . As a protective reflex , coughing can be repetitive with the cough reflex following three phases: an inhalation , a forced exhalation against a closed glottis , and a violent release of air from the lungs following opening of the glottis, usually accompanied by a distinctive sound. [1] Frequent coughing usually indicates the presence of a disease. Many viruses and bacteria benefit, from an evolutionary perspective, by causing the host to cough, which helps to spread the disease to new hosts. Most of the time, irregular coughing is caused by a respiratory tract infection but can also be triggered by choking , smoking , air pollution , [1] asthma , gastroesophageal reflux disease , post-nasal drip , chronic bronchitis , lung tumors , heart failure and medications such as angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) . Treatment should target the cause; for example, smoking cessation or discontinuing ACE inhibitors. Cough suppressants such as codeine or dextromethorphan are frequently prescribed, but have been demonstrated to have little effect. Other treatment options may target airway inflammation or may promote mucus expectoration . As it is a natural protective reflex, suppressing the cough reflex might have damaging effects, especially if the cough is productive. [2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delirium Delirium , also known as acute confusional state , is the organically caused decline from a previous baseline mental functioning that develops over a short period of time, typically hours to days. [1] [2] Delirium is a syndrome encompassing disturbances in attention, consciousness, and cognition. It may also involve other neurological deficits, such as psychomotor disturbances (e.g. hyperactive, hypoactive, or mixed), impaired sleep-wake cycle, emotional disturbances, and perceptual disturbances (e.g. hallucinations and delusions), although these features are not required for diagnosis. Delirium is caused by an acute organic process , which is a physically identifiable structural, functional, or chemical problem in the brain that may arise from a disease process outside the brain that nonetheless affects the brain. It may result from an underlying disease process (e.g. infection, hypoxia ), side effect of a medication, withdrawal from drugs, over-consumption of alcohol , usage of hallucinogenic deliriants , or from any number of factors affecting one's overall health (e.g. malnutrition, pain, etc.). In contrast, fluctuations in mental status/function due to changes in primarily psychiatric processes or diseases (e.g. schizophrenia , bipolar disorder ) do not, by definition, meet the criteria for 'delirium.' [3] Delirium may be difficult to diagnose without the proper establishment of a person's usual mental function. Without careful assessment and history, delirium can easily be confused with a number of psychiatric disorders or chronic organic brain syndromes because of many overlapping signs and symptoms in common with dementia , depression , psychosis , etc. [4] Delirium may manifest from a baseline of existing mental illness, baseline intellectual disability, or dementia, without being due to any of these problems. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delirium_tremens Delirium tremens ( DTs ) is a rapid onset of confusion usually caused by withdrawal from alcohol . [2] When it occurs, it is often three days into the withdrawal symptoms and lasts for two to three days. [2] Physical effects may include shaking , shivering, irregular heart rate , and sweating. [1] People may also hallucinate . [2] Occasionally, a very high body temperature or seizures may result in death. [2] Alcohol is one of the most dangerous drugs from which to withdraw . [5] Delirium tremens typically only occurs in people with a high intake of alcohol for more than a month. [6] A similar syndrome may occur with benzodiazepine and barbiturate withdrawal . [3] Withdrawal from stimulants such as cocaine do not have major medical complications. [7] In a person with delirium tremens it is important to rule out other associated problems such as electrolyte abnormalities , pancreatitis , and alcoholic hepatitis . [2] Prevention is by treating withdrawal symptoms. [2] If delirium tremens occurs, aggressive treatment improves outcomes. [2] Treatment in a quiet intensive care unit with sufficient light is often recommended. [2] Benzodiazepines are the medication of choice with diazepam , lorazepam , chlordiazepoxide , and oxazepam all commonly used. [6] They should be given until a person is lightly sleeping. [2] The antipsychotic haloperidol may also be used. [2] The vitamin thiamine is recommended. [2] Mortality without treatment is between 15% and 40%. [4] Currently death occurs in about 1% to 4% of cases. [2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_(mood)   Depression is a state of low mood and aversion to activity. [2] It can affect a person's thoughts, behavior, motivation, feelings , and sense of well-being . [3] The core symptom of depression is said to be anhedonia , which refers to loss of interest or a loss of feeling of pleasure in certain activities that usually bring joy to people. [4] Depressed mood is a symptom of some mood disorders such as major depressive disorder or dysthymia ; [5] it is a normal temporary reaction to life events, such as the loss of a loved one; and it is also a symptom of some physical diseases and a side effect of some drugs and medical treatments. It may feature sadness, difficulty in thinking and concentration and a significant increase or decrease in appetite and time spent sleeping. People experiencing depression may have feelings of dejection, hopelessness and, sometimes, suicidal thoughts. It can either be short term or long term. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea   Diarrhea , also spelled diarrhoea , is the condition of having at least three loose, liquid, or watery bowel movements each day. [2] It often lasts for a few days and can result in dehydration due to fluid loss. [2] Signs of dehydration often begin with loss of the normal stretchiness of the skin and irritable behaviour. [2] This can progress to decreased urination , loss of skin color , a fast heart rate , and a decrease in responsiveness as it becomes more severe. [2] Loose but non-watery stools in babies who are exclusively breastfed , however, are normal. [2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythema_ab_igne Erythema ab igne (EAI) , also known as hot water bottle rash , [2] is a skin condition caused by long-term exposure to heat ( infrared radiation ). [3] Prolonged thermal radiation exposure to the skin can lead to the development of reticulated erythema , hyperpigmentation, scaling and telangiectasias in the affected area. Some people may complain of mild itchiness and a burning sensation, but often, unless a change in pigmentation is seen, it can go unnoticed. Different types of heat sources can cause this condition such as: The pathogenesis of erythema ab igne remains unknown. It has been proposed that thermal radiation exposure can induce damage to superficial blood vessels that subsequently leads to epidermal vascular dilation. The dilation of vessels presents morphologically as the initially observed erythema. [4] Red blood cell extravasion and deposition of hemosiderin that follows clinically appears as hyperpigmentation, which can occur in a reticular distribution. It has also been proposed that the distribution of affected blood vessels — predominantly in the superficial subcutaneous plexus (found in the papillary dermis )— results in the net-like pattern of erythema ab igne skin lesions. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_memory In psychology , a false memory is a phenomenon where someone recalls something that did not happen or recalls it differently from the way it actually happened. Suggestibility , activation of associated information, the incorporation of misinformation, and source misattribution have been suggested to be several mechanisms underlying a variety of types of false memory phenomena. False memories are a component of false memory syndrome (FMS). [1] The false memory phenomenon was initially investigated by psychological pioneers Pierre Janet and Sigmund Freud . [2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasciculation A fasciculation , or muscle twitch , is a spontaneous, involuntary muscle contraction and relaxation, involving fine muscle fibers. [1] They are common, with as much as 70% of people experiencing them. [1] They can be benign, or associated with more serious conditions. [1] When no cause or pathology is identified, they are diagnosed as benign fasciculation syndrome . [1] The most effective way to detect fasciculations may be surface electromyography (EMG). Surface EMG is more sensitive than needle electromyography and clinical observation in the detection of fasciculation in people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis . [2] Deeper areas of contraction can be detected by electromyography (EMG) testing, though they can happen in any skeletal muscle in the body. Fasciculations arise as a result of spontaneous depolarization of a lower motor neuron leading to the synchronous contraction of all the skeletal muscle fibers within a single motor unit. An example of normal spontaneous depolarization is the constant contractions of cardiac muscle , causing the heart to beat. Usually, intentional movement of the involved muscle causes fasciculations to cease immediately, but they may return once the muscle is at rest again. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever  Fever , also referred to as pyrexia , is defined as having a temperature above the normal range due to an increase in the body's temperature set point . [1] [6] [7] There is not a single agreed-upon upper limit for normal temperature with sources using values between 37.2 and 38.3 °C (99.0 and 100.9 °F) in humans. [1] [2] [8] The increase in set point triggers increased muscle contractions and causes a feeling of cold or chills . [3] This results in greater heat production and efforts to conserve heat. [4] When the set point temperature returns to normal, a person feels hot, becomes flushed , and may begin to sweat . [4] Rarely a fever may trigger a febrile seizure , with this being more common in young children. [5] Fevers do not typically go higher than 41 to 42 °C (105.8 to 107.6 °F). [7] A fever can be caused by many medical conditions ranging from non-serious to life-threatening . [12] This includes viral , bacterial , and parasitic infections —such as influenza , the common cold , meningitis , urinary tract infections , appendicitis , COVID-19 , and malaria . [12] [13] Non-infectious causes include vasculitis , deep vein thrombosis , connective tissue disease , side effects of medication, and cancer . [12] [14] It differs from hyperthermia , in that hyperthermia is an increase in body temperature over the temperature set point, due to either too much heat production or not enough heat loss . [2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fistula A fistula (plural: fistulas or fistulae /- l i , - l aɪ / ; from Latin fistula , "tube, pipe") is an abnormal connection between two hollow spaces (technically, two epithelialized surfaces), such as blood vessels , intestines , or other hollow organs . [2] [3] [4] Types of fistula can be described by their location. Anal fistulas connect between the anal canal and the perianal skin. Anovaginal or rectovaginal fistulas occur when a hole develops between the anus or rectum and the vagina . Colovaginal fistulas occur between the colon and the vagina. Urinary tract fistulas are abnormal openings within the urinary tract or an abnormal connection between the urinary tract and another organ such as between the bladder and the uterus in a vesicouterine fistula, between the bladder and the vagina in a vesicovaginal fistula, and between the urethra and the vagina in urethrovaginal fistula. When occurring between two parts of the intestine, it is known as an enteroenteral fistula, between the small intestine and the skin as an enterocutaneous fistula, and between the small intestine and the colon as a colocutaneous fistula. [3] Fistulas can result from an infection or inflammation, injury or surgery. [5] Fistulas are sometimes purposefully surgically created as part of a treatment, for example arteriovenous fistulas for hemodialysis . [6] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequent_urination Frequent urination is the need to urinate more often than usual. Diuretics or medications that will increase urinary frequency. Nocturia is the need of frequent urination at night. [1] The most common cause of urinary frequency for women and children is a urinary tract infection . The most common cause of urinary frequency in older men is an enlarged prostate . [2] Frequent urination is strongly associated with frequent incidents of urinary urgency , which is the sudden need to urinate.  It is often, though not necessarily, associated with urinary incontinence and polyuria (large total volume of urine). However, in other cases, urinary frequency involves only normal volumes of urine overall. [3] [ citation needed ] The normal number of times varies according to the age of the person.  Among young children, urinating 8 to 14 times each day is typical.  This decreases to 6 to 12 times per day for older children, and to four to six times per day among teenagers. [4] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gangrene Gangrene is a type of tissue death caused by a lack of blood supply . [4] Symptoms may include a change in skin color to red or black, numbness, swelling, pain, skin breakdown, and coolness. [1] The feet and hands are most commonly affected. [1] If the gangrene is caused by an infectious agent it may present with a fever or sepsis . [1] Risk factors include diabetes , peripheral arterial disease , smoking , major trauma , alcoholism , HIV/AIDS , frostbite , influenza , COVID-19 , dengue fever , malaria , plague , meningococcal disease , Group B streptococcal infection and Raynaud's syndrome . [3] [4] It can be classified as dry gangrene , wet gangrene , gas gangrene , internal gangrene , and necrotizing fasciitis . [3] The diagnosis of gangrene is based on symptoms and supported by tests such as medical imaging . [6] Treatment may involve surgery to remove the dead tissue, antibiotics to treat any infection, and efforts to address the underlying cause. [5] Surgical efforts may include debridement , amputation , or the use of maggot therapy . [5] Efforts to treat the underlying cause may include bypass surgery or angioplasty . [5] In certain cases, hyperbaric oxygen therapy may be useful. [5] How commonly the condition occurs is unknown. [2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gynecomastia   Gynecomastia (also spelled Gynaecomastia ) [a] is the abnormal non-cancerous enlargement of one or both breasts in men due to the growth of breast tissue as a result of a hormone imbalance between estrogen and androgen . [4] [5] Gynecomastia can cause significant psychological distress or unease . [6] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halitosis  Bad breath , also known as halitosis , is a symptom in which a noticeably unpleasant breath odour is present. [1] It can result in anxiety among those affected. [1] It is also associated with depression and symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder . [1] The concerns of bad breath may be divided into genuine and non-genuine cases. [2] Of those who have genuine bad breath, about 85% of cases come from inside the mouth. [1] The remaining cases are believed to be due to disorders in the nose , sinuses , throat , lungs , esophagus , or stomach . [4] Rarely, bad breath can be due to an underlying medical condition such as liver failure or ketoacidosis . [2] Non-genuine cases occur when someone feels they have bad breath but someone else cannot detect it. [2] This is estimated to make up between 5% and 72% of cases. [2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headache Headache is the symptom of pain in the face , head , or neck . It can occur as a migraine , tension-type headache , or cluster headache . There is an increased risk of depression in those with severe headaches. [1] Headaches can occur as a result of many conditions. There are a number of different classification systems for headaches. The most well-recognized is that of the International Headache Society . Causes of headaches may include dehydration, fatigue, sleep deprivation, stress, the effects of medications, the effects of recreational drugs, viral infections, loud noises, common colds, head injury, rapid ingestion of a very cold food or beverage, and dental or sinus issues (such as sinusitis ). [2] Treatment of a headache depends on the underlying cause, but commonly involves pain medication . A headache is one of the most commonly experienced of all physical discomforts. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartburn Heartburn , also known as pyrosis , cardialgia or acid indigestion , [2] is a burning sensation in the central chest or upper central abdomen . [3] [4] [5] The discomfort often rises in the chest and may radiate to the neck, throat, or angle of the arm. Heartburn is usually due to regurgitation of gastric acid (gastric reflux) into the esophagus and is the major symptom of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). [6] In about 0.6% of cases it is a symptom of ischemic heart disease . [7] The term indigestion includes heartburn along with a number of other symptoms. [8] Indigestion is sometimes defined as a combination of epigastric pain and heartburn. [9] Heartburn is commonly used interchangeably with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) rather than just to describe a symptom of burning in one's chest. [10] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperactivity  Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by inattention , or excessive activity and impulsivity , which are otherwise not appropriate for a person's age. [1] [2] [3] [4] Some individuals with ADHD also display difficulty regulating emotions or problems with executive function . [1] [5] [6] [7] For a diagnosis, the symptoms have to be present for more than six months, and cause problems in at least two settings (such as school, home, work, or recreational activities). [1] [2] In children, problems paying attention may result in poor school performance . [8] Additionally, it is associated with other mental disorders and substance use disorders . [9] Although it causes impairment, particularly in modern society, many people with ADHD can have sustained attention for tasks they find interesting or rewarding (known as hyperfocus ). [10] [11] Despite being the most commonly studied and diagnosed mental disorder in children and adolescents, the precise cause or causes are unknown in the majority of cases. [12] Genetic factors are estimated to make up about 75% of the risk. [13] Nicotine exposure during pregnancy may be an environmental risk. [14] It does not appear to be related to the style of parenting or discipline. [15] It affects about 5–7% of children when diagnosed via the DSM-IV criteria [1] [16] and 1–2% when diagnosed via the ICD-10 criteria. [17] As of 2019, it was estimated to affect 84.7 million people globally. [18] Rates are similar between countries and differences in rates depend mostly on how it is diagnosed. [19] ADHD is diagnosed approximately two times more often in boys than in girls, [1] although the disorder is often overlooked in girls because their symptoms are often less disruptive. [20] [21] [22] About 30–50% of people diagnosed in childhood continue to have symptoms into adulthood and between 2–5% of adults have the condition. [23] [24] [25] In adults, inner restlessness, rather than hyperactivity, may occur. [26] Adults often develop coping skills which compensate for some or all of their impairments. [27] The condition can be difficult to tell apart from other conditions, as well as from high levels of activity within the range of normal behavior. [28] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hysteria  Hysteria is a pejorative term used colloquially to mean ungovernable emotional excess and can refer to a temporary state of mind or emotion. [1] In the 19th century, hysteria was considered a diagnosable physical illness in females. It is assumed that the basis for diagnosis operated under the belief that women are predisposed to mental and behavioral conditions; a misinterpretation of gender-related differences in stress responses. [2] In the 20th century, it shifted to being considered a mental illness. [3] Many influential persons such as Sigmund Freud and Jean-Martin Charcot dedicated research to hysteria patients. [4] Currently, most doctors practicing Western medicine do not accept hysteria as a medical diagnosis. [5] The blanket diagnosis of hysteria has been fragmented into myriad medical categories such as epilepsy , histrionic personality disorder , conversion disorders , dissociative disorders , or other medical conditions. [5] [6] Furthermore, lifestyle choices, such as deciding not to wed, are no longer considered symptoms of psychological disorders such as hysteria. [5] The word hysteria originates from the Greek word for uterus , hystera . [5] The oldest record of hysteria dates back to 1900 B.C. when Egyptians recorded behavioral abnormalities in adult women on medical papyrus. [5] The Egyptians attributed the behavioral disturbances to a wandering uterus—thus later dubbing the condition hysteria. [5] To treat hysteria Egyptian doctors prescribed various medications. [5] For example, doctors put strong smelling substances on the patients’ vulvas to encourage the uterus to return to its proper position. [5] Another tactic was to smell or swallow unsavory herbs to encourage the uterus to flee back to the lower part of the female’s abdomen. [5] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itch Itch (also known as pruritus ) is a sensation that causes the desire or reflex to scratch. [1] Itch has resisted many attempts to be classified as any one type of sensory experience. Itch has many similarities to pain , and while both are unpleasant sensory experiences, their behavioral response patterns are different. Pain creates a withdrawal reflex , whereas itch leads to a scratch reflex . [2] Unmyelinated nerve fibers for itch and pain both originate in the skin ; however, information for them is conveyed centrally in two distinct systems that both use the same nerve bundle and spinothalamic tract . [3] Most commonly, an itch is felt in one place.  If it is felt all over the body, then it is called generalized itch or generalized pruritus . [4] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaundice Jaundice , also known as icterus , is a yellowish or greenish pigmentation of the skin and whites of the eyes due to high bilirubin levels . [3] [6] Jaundice in adults is typically a sign indicating the presence of underlying diseases involving abnormal heme metabolism , liver dysfunction , or biliary-tract obstruction. [7] The prevalence of jaundice in adults is rare, while jaundice in babies is common, with an estimated 80% affected during their first week of life. [8] The most commonly associated symptoms of jaundice are itchiness , [2] pale feces , and dark urine . [4] Normal levels of bilirubin in blood are below 1.0 mg / dl (17 μmol / L ), while levels over 2–3 mg/dl (34-51 μmol/L) typically result in jaundice. [4] [9] High blood bilirubin is divided into two types - unconjugated  and conjugated bilirubin. [10] Causes of jaundice vary from nonserious to potentially fatal. [10] High unconjugated bilirubin may be due to excess red blood cell breakdown , large bruises , genetic conditions such as Gilbert's syndrome , not eating for a prolonged period of time, newborn jaundice, or thyroid problems . [4] [10] High conjugated bilirubin may be due to liver diseases such as cirrhosis or hepatitis , infections, medications , or blockage of the bile duct ,. [4] due to factors including gallstones , cancer , or pancreatitis . [4] Other conditions can also cause yellowish skin, but are not jaundice, including carotenemia , which can develop from eating large amounts of foods containing carotene — or medications such as rifampin . [4] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_hysteria Mass psychogenic illness ( MPI ), also called mass sociogenic illness , mass psychogenic disorder , epidemic hysteria , or mass hysteria , is the rapid spread of illness signs and symptoms affecting members of a cohesive group, originating from a nervous system disturbance involving excitation, loss, or alteration of function, whereby physical complaints that are exhibited unconsciously have no corresponding organic aetiology . [1] Mass psychogenic illness involves the spread of illness symptoms through a population where there is no infectious agent responsible for contagion. [2] MPI is distinct from other types of collective delusions by involving physical symptoms. [3] According to Balaratnasingam and Janca, "Mass hysteria is to date a poorly understood condition. Little certainty exists regarding its etiology." [4] Qualities of MPI outbreaks often include: [3] British psychiatrist Simon Wesseley distinguishes between two forms of MPI: [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_confusion  In medicine, confusion is the quality or state of being bewildered or unclear. The term "acute mental confusion" [1] is often used interchangeably with delirium [2] in the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems and the Medical Subject Headings publications to describe the pathology . These refer to the loss of orientation , or the ability to place oneself correctly in the world by time, location and personal identity. Mental confusion is sometimes accompanied by disordered consciousness (the loss of linear thinking) and memory loss (the inability to correctly recall previous events or learn new material). [3] The term is from Latin : confusĭo, -ōnis , from confundere : "to pour together", "to mingle together", "to confuse". Confusion may result from drug side effects or from a relatively sudden brain dysfunction.  Acute confusion is often called delirium (or "acute confusional state"), [4] although delirium often includes a much broader array of disorders than simple confusion.  These disorders include the inability to focus attention; various impairments in awareness, and temporal or spatial dis-orientation.  Mental confusion can result from chronic organic brain pathologies, such as dementia [ citation needed ] , as well. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea Nausea is a diffuse sensation of unease and discomfort, often perceived as an urge to vomit . [1] While not painful, it can be a debilitating symptom if prolonged and has been described as placing discomfort on the chest, upper abdomen, or back of the throat. [2] Over 30 definitions of nausea were proposed in a 2011 book on the topic. [3] Nausea is a non-specific symptom , which means that it has many possible causes. Some common causes of nausea are gastroenteritis and other gastrointestinal disorders , food poisoning , motion sickness , dizziness , migraine , fainting , low blood sugar and lack of sleep . Nausea is a side effect of many medications including chemotherapy , or morning sickness in early pregnancy. Nausea may also be caused by disgust and depression . [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pallor Pallor is a pale color of the skin that can be caused by illness, emotional shock or stress, stimulant use, or anemia , and is the result of a reduced amount of oxyhaemoglobin and may also be visible as pallor of the conjunctivae of the eyes on physical examination. Pallor is more evident on the face and palms . It can develop suddenly or gradually, depending on the cause. It is not usually clinically significant unless it is accompanied by a general pallor (pale lips , tongue , palms, mouth and other regions with mucous membranes ). It is distinguished from similar presentations such as hypopigmentation (lack or loss of skin pigment ) or simply a fair complexion. This medical sign article is a stub .

After four weeks in a vegetative state (VS), the patient is classified as in a persistent vegetative state. This diagnosis is classified as a permanent vegetative state some months (three in the US and six in the UK) after a non-traumatic brain injury or one year after a traumatic injury. Today, doctors and neuroscientists prefer to call the state of consciousness a syndrome , [2] primarily because of ethical questions about whether a patient can be called "vegetative" or not. [2] There are several definitions that vary by technical versus layman's usage. There are different legal implications in different countries. A wakeful unconscious state that lasts longer than a few weeks is referred to as a persistent (or 'continuing') vegetative state. [3] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_disability  Intellectual disability ( ID ), also known as general learning disability [3] and formerly mental retardation ( MR ), [4] [5] is a generalized neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by significantly impaired intellectual and adaptive functioning . It is defined by an IQ under 70 , in addition to deficits in two or more adaptive behaviors that affect everyday, general living. Intellectual functions are defined under DSM-V as reasoning, problem‑solving, planning, abstract thinking, judgment, academic learning, and learning from instruction and experience, and practical understanding confirmed by both clinical assessment and standardized tests. Adaptive behavior is defined in terms of conceptual, social, and practical skills involving tasks performed by people in their everyday lives. [6] Once focused almost entirely on cognition , the definition now includes both a component relating to mental functioning and one relating to an individual's functional skills in their daily environment. As a result of this focus on the person's abilities in practice, a person with an unusually low IQ may still not be considered to have an intellectual disability. [ citation needed ] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantom_smell Phantosmia (phantom smell), also called an olfactory hallucination or a phantom odor , [1] is smelling an odor that is not actually there. It can occur in one nostril or both. [2] Unpleasant phantosmia, cacosmia , is more common and is often described as smelling something that is burned, foul, spoiled, or rotten. [3] Experiencing occasional phantom smells is normal and usually goes away on its own in time. [4] When hallucinations of this type do not seem to go away or when they keep coming back, it can be very upsetting and can disrupt an individual's quality of life. [2] Olfactory hallucinations can be caused by common medical conditions such as nasal infections, nasal polyps , or dental problems. It can result from neurological conditions such as migraines, head injuries, strokes, Parkinson's disease , seizures , or brain tumors. [4] It can also be a symptom of certain mental disorders such as depression , bipolar disorder , intoxication or withdrawal from  drugs and alcohol, or psychotic disorders . [3] Environmental exposures are sometimes the cause as well, such as smoking, exposure to certain types of chemicals (e.g., insecticides or solvents ), or radiation treatment for head or neck cancer. [4] A physician can determine if the problem is with the sense of smell ( olfactory system ) or taste ( gustatory system ), or if it is caused by a neurological or psychiatric disorder. Phantosmia usually goes away on its own, though this can sometimes be gradual and occur over several years. [2] When caused by an illness (e.g., sinusitis ), it should go away when the illness resolves. [4] If the problem persists or causes significant discomfort, a doctor might recommend nasal saline drops, antidepressant or anticonvulsant medications, anesthesia to parts of the nose, or in very rare circumstances, surgical procedures to remove the olfactory nerves or bulbs . [2] [3] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polydipsia Polydipsia is excessive thirst or excess drinking. [1] The word derives from the Greek πολυδίψιος ( poludípsios ) "very thirsty", [2] which is derived from πολύς ( polús , "much, many") + δίψα ( dípsa , "thirst").  Polydipsia is a nonspecific symptom in various medical disorders. It also occurs as an abnormal behaviour in some non-human animals , such as in birds . [3] Polydipsia can be characteristic of diabetes mellitus , often as an initial symptom. It is observed in cases of poorly controlled diabetes, which is sometimes the result of low patient adherence to anti-diabetic medication . [1] Diabetes insipidus ("tasteless" diabetes, as opposed to diabetes mellitus) can also cause polydipsia. [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retching Retching (also known as dry heaving ) is the reverse movement ( retroperistalsis ) of the stomach and esophagus without vomiting . [1] It can be caused by bad smells or choking, or by withdrawal from some medications after vomiting stops. Retching can also occur as a result of an emotional response or from stress , which produces the same physical reaction. The function is thought to be mixing gastric contents with intestinal refluxate in order to buffer the former and give it momentum in preparation of vomiting. [2] Treatments include medication and correction of the fluid and electrolyte balance . The retching phase is characterized by a series of violent spasmodic abdomino - thoracic contractions with the glottis closed. During this time, the inspiratory (inhalatory) movements of the chest wall and diaphragm are opposed by the expiratory contractions of the abdominal musculature. At the same time, movements of the stomach and its contents take place. Whereas a patient will complain of disagreeable sensations during nausea , speech is not possible during retching. The characteristic movements furnish a ready diagnostic sign of the retching phase. Schindler (1937) [3] studied retching on two occasions during gastroscopy and noted that longitudinal folds appeared in the previously smooth antrum , thickened quickly, came together and completely closed the antrum. [4] Retching involves a deep inspiration against a closed glottis . This, along with contraction of the abdomen, leads to a pressure difference between the abdominal and thoracic cavities. As a result, the stomach and gastric contents are displaced upwards toward the thoracic cavity. [5] Retching comprises a rhythmically alternating (about once per second) elevation and descension of the entire pharyngolaryngo-esophago-gastric apparatus in synchrony with the movement of the diaphragm. The function of retching may be to mix gastric contents with intestinal refluxate to buffer gastric contents before gastroesophageal reflux and to impart a momentum to the gastric contents before vomiting. Airway protection during retching is accomplished by glottal closure during retches and constriction of the upper esophageal sphincter between retches. [2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrograde_amnesia Retrograde amnesia ( RA ) is a loss of memory-access to events that occurred or information that was learned in the past. It is caused by an injury or the onset of a disease. [1] It tends to negatively affect episodic , autobiographical , and declarative memory , while keeping procedural memory intact without increasing difficulty for learning new information. RA can be temporally graded, or more permanent based on the severity of its cause. It is usually consistent with Ribot's law . The law states that subjects are more likely to lose memories closer to the traumatic incident than more memories that happened further from the incident. [2] The type of information that is forgotten can range from a specific memory, such as a single event, or a more general memory. This would resemble generic amnesia . Anterograde amnesia is a similar condition that deals with the inability to form new memories following the onset of an injury or disease. RA commonly results from damage to regions of the brain that are associated with episodic and declarative memory, including autobiographical information. In extreme cases, individuals may completely forget who they are. Generally, this is a more severe type of amnesia known as global , or generalized amnesia. [3] However, memory loss can also be selective or categorical, manifested by a person's inability to remember events related to a specific incident or topic. Patients also differ in durations of RA (how long they can't recall information) and durations of what is forgotten (past time frame for which information is unavailable). In temporally graded retrograde amnesia, victims eventually recover most memories following the onset of RA. This suggests that the hippocampal formation / consolidation, the process of coding new information, [4] is only used in systematic consolidation for temporary storage, and short periods of time. Systemic consolidation then moves the information and long-term consolidation takes place in other brain structures. [5] The fact that damage to the hippocampal formation can eventually overcome RA suggests that other brain structures are able to take over the jobs of the malfunctioning regions. RA can also progress and further deteriorate memory recollection, as in the case of Korsakoff syndrome and Alzheimer's disease , due to the ongoing nature of the damage caused by the illnesses. The degree to which different patients recover from RA differs in time (some take a few days while others a few decades) and content (some will only remember certain specific instances while others more). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizophreniform_disorder Schizophreniform disorder is a mental disorder diagnosed when symptoms of schizophrenia are present for a significant portion of time (at least a month), but signs of disturbance are not present for the full six months required for the diagnosis of schizophrenia. The symptoms of both disorders can include delusions , hallucinations , disorganized speech , disorganized or catatonic behavior , and social withdrawal . While impairment in social, occupational, or academic functioning is required for the diagnosis of schizophrenia, in schizophreniform disorder an individual's level of functioning may or may not be affected. While the onset of schizophrenia is often gradual over a number of months or years, the onset of schizophreniform disorder can be relatively rapid. Like schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder is often treated with antipsychotic medications , especially the atypicals , along with a variety of social supports (such as individual psychotherapy , family therapy , occupational therapy , etc.) designed to reduce the social and emotional impact of the illness. The prognosis varies depending upon the nature, severity, and duration of the symptoms, but about two-thirds of individuals diagnosed with schizophreniform disorder go on to develop schizophrenia. [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_addiction Sexual addiction , also known as sex addiction , is a state characterized by compulsive participation or engagement in sexual activity , particularly sexual intercourse , despite negative consequences. [1] Proponents of a diagnostic model for sexual addiction consider it to be one of several sex-related disorders within hypersexual disorder . [2] The term sexual dependence is also used to refer to people who report being unable to control their sexual urges , behaviors, or thoughts. Related or synonymous models of pathological sexual behavior include hypersexuality (nymphomania and satyriasis), erotomania , Don Juanism , and paraphilia -related disorders. [3] [4] [5] The concept of sexual addiction is contentious. [6] [7] There is considerable debate among psychiatrists , psychologists , sexologists , and other specialists whether compulsive sexual behavior constitutes an addiction, and therefore its classification and possible diagnosis. Animal research has established that compulsive sexual behavior arises from the same transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms that mediate drug addiction in laboratory animals; however, as of 2018, [update] sexual addiction is not a clinical diagnosis in either the DSM or ICD medical classifications of diseases and medical disorders. Some argue that applying such concepts to normal behaviors such as sex can be problematic, and suggest that applying medical models such as addiction to human sexuality can serve to pathologise normal behavior and cause harm. [8] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinusitis Sinusitis , also known as rhinosinusitis , is inflammation of the mucous membranes that line the sinuses resulting in symptoms that may include thick nasal mucus , a plugged nose , and facial pain . [1] [6] Other signs and symptoms may include fever , headaches , a poor sense of smell , sore throat , and a cough . [2] It is defined as acute sinusitis if it lasts less than 4 weeks, and as chronic sinusitis if it lasts for more than 12 weeks. [1] Sinusitis can be caused by infection , allergies , air pollution , or structural problems in the nose. [2] Most cases are caused by a viral infection . [2] Recurrent episodes are more likely in persons with asthma , cystic fibrosis , and poor immune function . [1] X-rays are not usually needed unless complications are suspected. [1] In chronic cases, confirmatory testing is recommended by either direct visualization or computed tomography . [1] Some cases may be prevented by hand washing, avoiding smoking, and immunization . [2] Pain killers such as naproxen , nasal steroids , and nasal irrigation may be used to help with symptoms. [1] [4] Recommended initial treatment for acute sinusitis is watchful waiting . [1] If symptoms do not improve in 7–10 days or get worse, then an antibiotic may be used or changed. [1] In those in whom antibiotics are used, either amoxicillin or amoxicillin/clavulanate is recommended first line. [1] Surgery may occasionally be used in people with chronic disease. [7] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_paralysis Sleep paralysis is a state, during waking up or falling asleep , in which a person is aware but unable to move or speak. [1] [2] During an episode, one may hallucinate (hear, feel, or see things that are not there), which often results in fear . [1] Episodes generally last less than a couple of minutes. [2] It may occur as a single episode or be recurrent. [1] The condition may occur in those who are otherwise healthy or those with narcolepsy , or it may run in families as a result of specific genetic changes. [2] The condition can be triggered by sleep deprivation , psychological stress , or abnormal sleep cycles . [2] The underlying mechanism is believed to involve a dysfunction in REM sleep . [2] Sleep paralysis is commonly experienced by lucid dreamers; some lucid dreamers use this as a method of having a lucid dream . [3] Diagnosis is based on a person's description. [2] Other conditions that can present similarly include narcolepsy, atonic seizure , and hypokalemic periodic paralysis . [2] Treatment options for sleep paralysis have been poorly studied. [1] It is recommended that people be reassured that the condition is common and generally not serious. [1] Other efforts that may be tried include sleep hygiene , cognitive behavioral therapy , and antidepressants . [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somnolence Somnolence (alternatively " sleepiness " or " drowsiness ") is a state of strong desire for sleep , or sleeping for unusually long periods (compare hypersomnia ). It has distinct meanings and causes. It can refer to the usual state preceding falling asleep , [1] the condition of being in a drowsy state due to circadian rhythm disorders, or a symptom of other health problems. It can be accompanied by lethargy , weakness, and lack of mental agility. [2] Somnolence is often viewed as a symptom rather than a disorder by itself. However, the concept of somnolence recurring at certain times for certain reasons constitutes various disorders, such as excessive daytime sleepiness , shift work sleep disorder , and others; and there are medical codes for somnolence as viewed as a disorder. Sleepiness can be dangerous when performing tasks that require constant concentration, such as driving a vehicle. When a person is sufficiently fatigued , microsleeps may be experienced. In individuals deprived of sleep, somnolence may spontaneously dissipate for short periods of time; this phenomenon is the second wind , and results from the normal cycling of the circadian rhythm interfering with the processes the body carries out to prepare itself to rest. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevens%E2%80%93Johnson_syndrome  Stevens–Johnson syndrome ( SJS ) is a type of severe skin reaction . [1] Together with toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and Stevens–Johnson/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN), it forms a spectrum of disease , with SJS being less severe. [1] [3] Erythema multiforme (EM) is generally considered a separate condition. [5] Early symptoms of SJS include fever and flu-like symptoms . [1] A few days later, the skin begins to blister and peel, forming painful raw areas. [1] Mucous membranes , such as the mouth, are also typically involved. [1] Complications include dehydration , sepsis , pneumonia and multiple organ failure . [1] The most common cause is certain medications such as lamotrigine , carbamazepine , allopurinol , sulfonamide antibiotics and nevirapine . [1] Other causes can include infections such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae and cytomegalovirus , or the cause may remain unknown. [2] [1] Risk factors include HIV/AIDS and systemic lupus erythematosus . [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syncope Syncope may refer to: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought_disorder  A thought disorder ( TD ) is any disturbance in cognition that adversely affects language and thought content, and thereby communication. [1] [2] A variety of thought disorders were said to be characteristic of people with schizophrenia . [1] A content-thought disorder is typically characterised by the experience of multiple delusional fragments. [3] The term, thought disorder, is often used to refer to a formal thought disorder. A formal thought disorder ( FTD ) is a disruption of the form or structure of thought. [4] Formal thought disorder, also known as disorganised thinking, results in disorganised speech, and is recognised as a major feature of schizophrenia , and other psychoses . [5] [6] FTD is also associated with conditions including mood disorders , dementia , mania , and neurological diseases . [7] [5] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinnitus  Tinnitus is the perception of sound when no corresponding external sound is present. [1] Nearly everyone will experience a faint "normal tinnitus" in a completely quiet room but it is only of concern if it is bothersome or interferes with normal hearing or correlated with other problems. [6] While often described as a ringing, it may also sound like a clicking, buzzing, hiss, or roaring. [2] The sound may be soft or loud, low or high pitched , and often appears to be coming from one or both ears or from the head itself. [2] In some people, the sound may interfere with concentration and in some cases it is associated with anxiety and depression. [2] Tinnitus is usually associated with some degree of hearing loss and with decreased understanding in noisy environments. [2] It is common, affecting about 10–15% of people. [5] Most, however, tolerate it well, and it is a significant problem in only 1–2% of people. [5] The word tinnitus comes from the Latin tinnire which means "to ring". [3] Rather than a disease, tinnitus is a symptom that may result from various underlying causes and can may be generated at any level of the auditory system and structures beyond that system. [2] The most common causes are hearing damage, noise-induced hearing loss or age-related hearing loss, known as presbycusis . [2] Other causes include ear infections , disease of the heart or blood vessels , Ménière's disease , brain tumors , exposure to certain medications, a previous head injury , earwax , and sometimes, the tinnitus is suddenly perceived during a period of emotional stress . [2] [4] It is more common in those with depression. [3] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomit  Vomiting (also known as puking , throwing up , barfing , emesis , among other names) is the involuntary, forceful expulsion of the contents of one's stomach through the mouth and sometimes the nose . [1] Vomiting can be caused by many conditions; it may be present as a specific response to ailments like gastritis [2] or poisoning , or as a non-specific sequela ranging from brain tumors and elevated intracranial pressure to overexposure to ionizing radiation . The feeling that one is about to vomit is called nausea ; it often precedes, but does not always lead to vomiting. Antiemetics are sometimes necessary to suppress nausea and vomiting. In severe cases, where dehydration develops, intravenous fluid may be required. Self-induced vomiting can be a component of an eating disorder such as bulimia , and is itself now classified as an eating disorder on its own, purging disorder . [3]
