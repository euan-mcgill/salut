Coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID-19 ) is an infectious disease caused by SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) , [8] a virus closely related to the SARS virus . [9] [10] [11] The disease is the cause of the COVID-19 pandemic . [12] [13] Those who get the disease might get a fever , dry cough , fatigue (tiredness) and shortness of breath. A sore throat, runny nose or sneezing is less common. In very bad cases, they can even get a much worse fever, fewer white blood cells , and loss of appetite. They might cough up blood, and have kidney failure . People with this disease can get pneumonia and multi-organ failure if they are weak, old, or are already sick. [12] [13] There are people who are called asymptomatic carriers , which means that they did not have all or some of the symptoms of the virus. This is very dangerous since they may not know that they have the virus and can give it to other people without knowing it. The countries with the most sick people are the USA, India and Brazil. COVID-19 virus travels from person to person through the air like the common cold does. Scientists think the virus is not able to hang in the air a long time and go far like the measles virus does. [14] 
SARS coronavirus 2 ( SARS-CoV-2 ) is a positive-sense , single-stranded RNA coronavirus which causes the disease COVID-19 . [2] It used to be known as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by the World Health Organization (WHO). [3] [4] The virus started the 2019–20 coronavirus outbreak . [5] [6] [7] The first suspected cases were reported to the WHO on December 31, 2019. [8] [9] Many early cases of this new coronavirus were linked to Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, a large seafood and animal market in Wuhan , China. The virus may have come from infected animals. It is not certain that this place was the source of the pandemic . [10] The genetic material of this virus showed many similarities to SARS-CoV (79.5%) [11] and bat coronaviruses (96%). [11] This means the virus may have originally come from bats . [12] [13] [14] Scientists did more experiments that showed the virus probably went from bats to an intermediate host , meaning another animal in between bats and humans.  The viruses in that other animal changed over time until they could infect humans.  Scientists are close to sure that the original animal was a bat but not sure what the intermediate animal was. [15] Some scientists think it could have been a pangolin because there are coronaviruses that live in pangolins even though they are not exactly the same as SARS-CoV-2 or the ones in bats. [16] Pangolins are an endangered species and buying, selling or moving them from place to place is illegal in China and many other countries.  But their scales are an ingredient in many traditional Chinese medicines , so they are often sold on the black market . [17] Although SARS-CoV-2 began in bats, scientists noticed that the bats do not get sick and die from it.  They think this is because the bats have very careful immune systems that fight the virus without causing inflammation .  Scientists are studying bats because of this. [18] [19] 
The 2020 stock market crash is a global stock market crash that began on 20 February 2020 during the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic . [1] [2] [3] The Dow Jones Industrial Average , S&P 500 Index , and the NASDAQ-100 all fell into short-term decline on 27 February during one of the worst trading weeks since the financial crisis of 2007–08 . [4] [5] Markets over the following week (2–6 March) became extremely bad, with swings of 3% or more being made per daily session (except for 6 March). [6] [7] On 9 March, all three Wall Street indices fell more than 7% and most global markets reported severe losses, due to the response of the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic and the Russia–Saudi Arabia oil price war . [8] [9] This became known as Black Monday , and at the time was the worst drop since the Great Recession in 2008. [10] [11] Three days after Black Monday there was another drop, Black Thursday , where stocks across Europe and North America fell more than 9%. 
The 501Y.V2 variant , also known as South African COVID-19 variant , is a variant of the SARS-CoV-2 , the virus that causes COVID-19 . It is one of several SARS-CoV-2 variants. It was first detected in the Nelson Mandela Bay [1] metropolitan area of the Eastern Cape province of South Africa . On 23 December 2020, the United Kingdom health minister Matt Hancock said that two people who had travelled from South Africa to the United Kingdom were infected with the 501.V2. [2] On 28 December, the variant was detected in two people in Switzerland [3] and one in Finland . [4] The United States reported its first cases of the variant in the U.S. state of South Carolina . [5]  
Abenomask is a Japanese political word named after Shinzo Abe . [1] It is used in Japan for two meanings: [2] [3] [4] [5] Abenomask-like actions are taken in other regions including Spain [6] and the United States [7] etc. 
African Americans are more likely to catch COVID-19 compared to their white counterparts. [1] African Americans are also more likely to die from the disease. [2] African Americans are less likely to get vaccinated . [3] 
Black Thursday [1] was a global stock market crash on March 12, 2020 as part of the greater 2020 stock market crash . Global stock markets suffered the greatest single-day fall since the 1987 stock market crash . [2] Following Black Monday three days earlier, Black Thursday was caused by the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic and a lack of investor confidence in United States President Donald Trump after he added a 30-day travel ban against the Schengen Area . [3] 
Coronaviruses are a group of RNA viruses . [5] [6] They cause diseases in birds and mammals , including humans . These diseases can be mild, or they can be fatal. In humans and birds, they cause respiratory tract infections. Mild illnesses in humans include some cases of the common cold (which is also caused by other viruses, for example rhinoviruses ). More lethal varieties can cause SARS , MERS , and COVID-19 . They are enveloped viruses with a positive-sense RNA genome . [7] The genome size of coronaviruses is about 26 to 32 kilobases, [8] which is extraordinarily large for an RNA virus . There are four major groups of coronaviruses, called alpha, beta, gamma and delta. The most famous coronavirus is one of the betas, the kind that causes Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in humans. The name "coronavirus" comes from the Latin word corona , meaning "crown" or "halo", and refers to how virions look under an electron microscopy (E.M.). [9] They have a fringe of large, bulbous surface projections looking like a crown. This morphology is created by the viral spike (S) peplomers , which are proteins on the surface of the virus. They decide which cells the virus can infect. 
COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access , abbreviated as COVAX , is a global program that helps give COVID-19 vaccines to people living in poor countries led by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance ,  the World Health Organization (WHO), the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), and others. [1] By 15 July 2020, 165 countries – representing 60% of the human population – had joined COVAX. [2] 
The COVID-19 Advisory Board was announced in November 2020 by then President-elect of the United States Joe Biden as part of his presidential transition . It is co-chaired by physicians David A. Kessler , Marcella Nunez-Smith , and Vivek Murthy and comprises 13 health experts. The goal of the advisory board is to create ideas and rules on how to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States during Biden's transition period. The board was dissolved when Biden was inaugurated on January 20, 2021 and was replaced with the White House COVID-19 Response Team . University of Chicago ( JD ) 
COVID-19 pandemic caused many governments to limit the spread of the disease by adding stay-at-home orders , curfews , quarantines , cordons sanitaires and similar societal restrictions. [1] By April 2020, about half of the world's population was under some form of lockdown, with more than 3.9 billion people in more than 90 countries or territories having been asked or ordered to stay at home by their governments. [2] 
The COVID-19 pandemic , also called the coronavirus pandemic , is a current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). [1] [6] [b] The outbreak started in Wuhan , Hubei , China, in December 2019. The World Health Organization (WHO) called it a pandemic on 11 March 2020. [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses gave the virus its name. As of February 19, 2021, more than 110 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in more than 188 countries and territories. More than two million people have died of COVID-19, [12] and more than 85 million people have defeated, or recovered from the disease. [12] [13] [14] The virus usually moves from one person to another with small drops made when coughing [15] [16] or sneezing . [17] It mostly spreads when people are close to each other, which is why social distancing is encouraged. Coronavirus can also spread when people touch a surface with the virus, and then they touch their face. [16] [17] Common symptoms include fever , cough, and trouble breathing. [18] The illness can worsen with pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome . [19] As of January 2021, a number of vaccines for COVID-19 have been developed, but only a few have been approved as safe for use. The first vaccine to be approved was created by Pfizer and BioNTech , [20] followed by the Oxford / AstraZeneca [21] vaccine. Vaccine distribution has begun in many countries in Europe, North America, South America and Asia. [22] The United Kingdom was the first western country to administer a COVID-19 vaccine. [23] No antiviral medicine for COVID-19 is available. [24] Doctors usually give patients supportive therapy instead. [25] People can avoid spreading the virus by regularly washing their hands, covering their mouth when coughing, maintaining distance from other people , staying away from crowds, wearing medical or cloth face coverings, and being alone for people who think they are infected, also known as quarantining . [24] The outbreak might be from a coronavirus that usually lives in bats . This infected another animal, possibly a pangolin . It then changed inside that other animal until it could infect humans. [26] It originated at a wet market Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market and is linked to China’s wild animal meat trade. Live foxes , crocodiles , wolf pups, giant salamanders , snakes , rats , peacocks , porcupines , koalas and game meats were on the menu at the market. [27] A 55-year-old person from Hubei province was the first human to contract the virus on November 17, 2019. [28] A 61-year-old man who was a regular customer at the market was the first person to die from the virus on January 11, 2020. [29] The exact origin of the virus is still unknown since the market in Wuhan sold a variety of live wild animals in cages. Chinese tourists have spread the virus by traveling to other countries and made it a worldwide pandemic. [30] Racism and xenophobia against Chinese people and Asians increased during the pandemic. 
The first case of COVID-19 in Africa was reported in Egypt on February 14, 2020. 
Deaths by county per 100,000 inhabitants as of 27 August 2020 The COVID-19 pandemic was confirmed to have reached Albania on 8 March 2020 , a father and son who had travelled from Florence , Italy . [1] As of 10 September 2020, there are 10,860 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Albania . [2] After the first case was reported on 8 March, the Ministry of Health and Social Protection stated that a total of 65 people had been tested for COVID-19 , 2 of whom were positive the following day. [3] 
The COVID-19 pandemic in Antarctica is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID-19 ) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS-CoV-2 ). Antarctica was the last continent to have confirmed cases of COVID-19 and was one of the last regions of the world affected by the pandemic. [1] [2] [3] The first cases were reported in December 2020, almost a year after the first cases of COVID-19 were seen in China. [4] 
The COVID-19 pandemic in Australia began on 25 January 2020, in Victoria . A man who had returned from Wuhan , China, tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 . [2] The Australian government stopped all non-residents from entering the country on 20 March. [3] Social distancing rules were put in place on 21 March. The state governments closed "non-essential" services. [4] [5] This included social gathering places such as hotels and clubs, but not businesses such as construction, manufacturing and many retail stores. [6] The number of new cases grew sharply, until reaching about 350 per day on 22 March. The numbers stayed around 350, and then started falling at the beginning of April. At the end of April it was under 20 cases per day. [7] As of 15 February 2021, there were 28,098 cases and 908 deaths in Australia. A virus that caused a respiratory illness was first seen in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019. It reported to the World Health Organisation (WHO) on 31 December 2019. WHO declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January, and a pandemic on 11 March. 
The COVID-19 pandemic was confirmed to have reached Bosnia and Herzegovina on 5 March 2020 in Banja Luka, who had been in Italy during the COVID-19 pandemic . Later the same day, a second case who was the son of the first case. [1] On 21 March 2020, the first death in the country from COVID-19 was announced in a hospital in Bihać . The patient was an elderly woman who had been hospitalized two days before. As of 13 May 2020, in Bosnia and Herzegovina there were 2182 confirmed coronavirus cases, of which 1168 were in Republika Srpska , [2] [3] 994 in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina , [4] [5] and 20 in Brčko District . [6] On 17 March 2020, the Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina declared a state of emergency in all of Bosnia and Herzegovina. [7] 
The COVID-19 pandemic in Canada is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID-19 ) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS-CoV-2 ). The disease was confirmed to have reached Canada on January 27, 2020, after a man who had returned to Toronto from Wuhan , Hubei , China, tested positive. As of September 10, 2020 [update] , there have been over 134,000 confirmed cases, 118,000 recoveries and 9,000 deaths in the country. [2] The Government of Canada says that around 11,000–22,000 deaths could happen over the course of the pandemic. [3] Most of those cases are in Canada's most populous provinces, Ontario (19,598 cases, 1,540 deaths) [4] and Quebec (36,150 cases, 2,725 deaths). [5] Confirmed cases have been reported in all of Canada's provinces and territories, with the exception of Nunavut . An additional 13 cases involve citizens from the Grand Princess cruise ship.

The first case of COVID-19 in New Zealand during the 2019–20 COVID-19 pandemic was reported on 28 February 2020. As of 14 May 2020 [update] , the country has a total of 1,497 cases, of which 65 are currently active, and 21 people have died from the virus. [1] All borders and entry ports of New Zealand were closed to all non-residents at 11:59 pm on 19 March 2020, with returning citizens and residents being required to self-isolate. Since 10 April, all New Zealanders returning from overseas must go into two weeks of quarantine . A four-level alert level system was added on 21 March to manage the outbreak within New Zealand. On 16 March, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern called for an end to public gatherings of more than 500 people and warned that the outbreak could lead to a recession greater than the 2008 global financial crisis . [2] [3] 
The first confirmed case relating to the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria was announced on February 27 2020, when an Italian citizen in Lagos tested positive for the virus SARS-CoV-2 . [1] [2] On March 9, 2020, a second case of the virus was reported in Ewekoro , Ogun State , in a Nigerian citizen who had contact with the Italian citizen. [3] On March 23, there were ten new cases: six in Lagos State, three in the FCT and one in Edo State . [4] They also confirmed their first death, a 67-year-old Suleiman Achimugu. [5] [6] Nigeria is Africa's largest economy, and it has a large oil industry.  It was hit hard when oil prices fell below zero in spring 2020 because of the pandemic. [7] 
The COVID-19 pandemic was confirmed to have reached Oceania on 25 January 2020 with the first confirmed case reported in Melbourne , Australia . [1] It has since spread elsewhere in the region, [2] although many small Pacific island nations have thus far avoided the outbreak by closing their international borders. As of 6 July, ten Oceania sovereign states have yet to report a case - Kiribati , Marshall Islands , Federated State of Micronesia , Nauru , Palau , Samoa , Solomon Islands , Tonga , Tuvalu and Vanuatu . 
The COVID-19 pandemic was confirmed to have reached Papua New Guinea on 20 March 2020. [2] On 4 May, all known cases recovered. [1] On 20 March, the first case in Papua New Guinea was confirmed. [2] On 7 April, Papua New Guinea confirmed its second case of COVID-19. [3] On 4 May, acting Health Secretary Dr Paison Dakulala reported that all known cases have recovered, but stresses that they don't know what they are fighting. 2,400 tests have been carried out with the bulk in Port Moresby . [1] 
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic spread to the United Kingdom in late January 2020. By 13 May there had been  229,705 confirmed cases [nb 4] and  33,186 deaths overall. [nb 2] More than 90% of those dying had underlying illnesses or were over 60 years old. The infection rate was higher in care homes than in the community. There were large regional difference in the outbreak's severity. The outbreak in London had the highest total number and the most infections. England and Wales were the UK countries with the highest recorded death rate per head, and Northern Ireland had the lowest. The Department of Health and Social Care created a public health campaign to help slow the virus's spread, and began posting daily updates in early February. In February, the Heath Secretary , Matt Hancock , proposed the Health Protection (Coronavirus) Regulations 2020 . Hospitals set up drive-through screening (testing for the disease). The Chief Medical Officer for England, Chris Whitty , created a four-stage strategy to tackle the outbreak: contain, delay, research and mitigate (help, lessen). 
The coronavirus recession , also known as the Great Lockdown [1] or Great Shutdown , [2] is an ongoing major global economic recession affecting the world economy in early 2020 [3] [4] [5] during the COVID-19 pandemic . [6] [7] The recession has caused the largest economic downturn since the Great Depression . [8] On 14 April 2020, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) reported that all of the G7 nations had already entered or were entering into what was called a "deep recession". [9] The IMF has stated that the economic decline is "far worse" than that of the Great Recession in 2009. [10] [11] [12] [13] The pandemic has led to more than a third of the world's population being placed on lockdown to stop the spread of COVID-19 . [14] This has caused severe economic downfalls for economies across the world, [15] following soon after a global economic slowdown during 2019 that saw a lowering numbers in stock markets worldwide. [16] [17] The United Nations (UN) predicted in April 2020 that global unemployment will wipe out 6.7 per cent of working hours globally in the second quarter of 2020—equivalent to 195 million full-time workers. [18] 
COVID-19 testing can help find the SARS-CoV-2 virus. There are two types of test; one can find the virus (i.e. Polymerase chain reaction , also called PCR) and the other that can find antibodies produced in response to infection . An accurate mortality rate of the disease and the level of herd immunity in the population can be found from the results of these tests. However, it is still not known how long immunity will last, and how effective it will be. [1] Due to limited testing, as of March 2020, no countries had reliable data of the virus. [2] Demonstration of a nose swab ( nasopharyngeal swab ) for COVID‑19 testing 
A COVID-19 vaccine is any of the vaccines used against the Coronavirus Disease 2019 ( COVID-19 pandemic ). In July 2020, more than 150 vaccines were being developed in different laboratories. [1] Two mRNA vaccines , one by Pfizer and one by Moderna , were approved late in 2020. Both are over 90% effective. [2] A few vaccines also went into use in early 2021. Several countries plan to give the vaccine to many people, but their plans are different. The United Kingdom plans to use its National Health Service .  Canada plans to use its military. The United States plans to send vaccines to all fifty states and then let the state governments each make their own system. [3] The United Kingdom approved the Pfizer vaccine before the European Union or United States did. They began giving it to people on December 8. [4] The United States began giving people the vaccine on December 14, starting with health care workers in New York City . [5] By April 2021, several vaccines were in use around the world and hundreds of millions of people had been vaccinated. In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect a vaccine against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative virus, to become available in less than 18 months. [6] The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) – which is organizing a US$2 billion worldwide fund for fast investment and creation of vaccine candidates [7] – indicated in April that a vaccine may be available under emergency use protocols in less than 12 months or by early 2021. [8] On 4 May 2020, the WHO organized a telethon (fundraising event broadcasted via televisions) to raise US$8 billion from forty countries to support rapid development of vaccines to prevent COVID-19 infections and deaths. [9] The United States government started Operation Warp Speed to develop a vaccine by January 2021. [1] 
Brett E. Crozier is an American naval officer. When he was captain of the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt , he noticed that some of his crew had caught COVID-19 , a serious disease that affects the lungs and breathing.  Late in March, 2020, he wrote letters asking for permission to send his sick sailors off his ship to Guam .  These letters were found and printed in a newspaper.  A few days later, the Navy fired Crozier as the captain of the Theodore Roosevelt but did not fire him from the Navy entirely. [1] [2] [3] In late April, some leaders in the Navy asked that Crozier be reinstated and sent back as captain of the Theodore Roosevelt . [4] Brett Crozier is from Santa Rosa , California .  He graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1992 and became a pilot for the Navy in 1994.  He fought in Iraq in 2003.  He later earned a Master's Degree in National Security and Strategic Studies at the Naval War College .  He served in many different positions in the Navy, including Executive Officer of the USS Ronald Reagan .  Brett Crozier was captain of the USS Blue Ridge from June 2017 to November 2018. [5] He wrote more than twenty copies of a four-page letter, dated March 30, 2020.  He addressed it to senior officials in the military.  He asked for permission to send 1000 of his crew off the ship.  The ship had more than 4000 people on it.  Someone found his messages and they were printed in the newspaper San Francisco Chronicle on March 31, 2020. 
Diamond Princess is a British-registered cruise ship owned and operated by Princess Cruises . She began operation in March 2004 and mainly cruises in Asia during the northern hemisphere summer and Australia during the southern hemisphere summer. Diamond Princess was built in Nagasaki, Japan , by Mitsubishi Industries . There have been two known outbreaks of infectious disease on the ship – an outbreak of gastroenteritis caused by norovirus in 2016 and an outbreak of the COVID-19 coronavirus in 2020. [1] At least 712 out of the 3,711 passengers and crew were infected, [1] and fourteen have died. [2] 
The Farmers to Families Food Box program is set up by the United States ' government during the COVID-19 pandemic to help get fresh food from farmers to consumers. The food is put into "family-sized" boxes containing produce, dairy products and/or meat. The programs is run by the USDA ( Department of Agriculture ).  It is part of the government's general response to the pandemic, called the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program  run by the USDA.  It was announced on April 15, 2020. According to the program's home page, over 70,000,000 boxes were invoiced between the start date and then end of August. [1] As of the second week of August 2020, the program's budget was three billion dollars. [2] The USDA buys the produce from farmers. Then the food is sent to local packaging companies.  These companies distribute the packages to local organizations such as NGOs and religious orga nizations. The program sets no restrictions on which families may pick of the boxes. [3] The program has been positively received.  However, there has been some criticism.  For example, the boxes weigh forty pounds.  This can make it difficult for people without a car to get the boxes home.  Also, the program initially only had boxes with produce, dairy products and meat.  Since some people do not eat dairy or meat products, this created a problem. [4] It has also been stated that specialty-crop farmers have not been helped enough by the program. [5] 
Anthony Stephen Fauci ( / ˈ f aʊ tʃ i / ; born December 24, 1940) is an American immunologist . He works for the National Institutes of Health of the  United States. He is the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). He became well known in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States for his information about preventing the spread of disease . He has been called "the nation’s leading expert on infectious diseases". [1] He is a member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force on the 2020 coronavirus pandemic . On December 4, 2020, newly elected President Joe Biden announced that Fauci would serve as Chief Medical Advisor to the President in the Biden administration. [2]  
Flattening the curve is a public health strategy to slow down the spread of the COVID-19 virus during the COVID-19 pandemic . The curve being flattened is the epidemic curve , a representation of the number of infected people needing health care over time. During an epidemic, a health care system can break down when the number of people infected passes the health care system's ability to take care of them. Flattening the curve means slowing the spread of the epidemic so that the peak number of people requiring care at a time is reduced, and the health care system does not pass its capacity. Flattening the curve relies on techniques such as quarantine , stay at home orders , and social distancing . 
Gam-COVID-Vac ( Russian : Гам-КОВИД-Вак , romanized: Gam-KOVID-Vak ), trade-named Sputnik V , is a COVID-19 vaccine created by the Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology , and registered on 11 August 2020 by the Russian Ministry of Health . [1] [2] [3] Gam-COVID-Vac has been approved for distribution in Russia . [1] [4] [5] 
The Josh Fight was a viral internet meme and pretend fight at Air Park in Lincoln, Nebraska , on April 24, 2021. [1] [2] A college student named Josh Swain from Tucson, Arizona had the idea for the Josh Fight.  He was bored because of the COVID-19 pandemic , and this gave him the idea. [3] He talked about it on April 24, 2020. After a screenshot of a Facebook Messenger group chat involving several users named Josh spread widely on the internet , many people learned about the Josh Fight. Swain told other people named Josh Swain to meet at a set of coordinates , where they would fight for the right to be the only person to be called "Josh Swain." Later, more people with the first name Josh became interested.  Swain meant this as a joke, but several hundred people showed up on the day of the event. Despite the title, there was no violence involved and the gathering was lighthearted.  Fighting involved playing rock, paper, scissors and hitting each other with pool noodles made of light foam.  The fighters raised over $7000 for charity.  A four-year-old fighter, Joshua Vinson Jr., nicknamed "Little Josh," won the fight. [4]

The COVID-19 pandemic started in the city of Wuhan, China in December 2019. It has led to increased acts of prejudice , xenophobia , discrimination , racism and violence against people of Southeast Asian , Hispanic , East Asian , Native American , biracial and black people all over the world. With the spread of the pandemic and in formation of hotspots, like those in Asia , Europe and the Americas , discrimination against people from these hotspots was reported. According to the Embassy of Japan in Cairo , store clerks were hesitating to serve Japanese customers. "Corona" became a new slur by which to abuse Japanese people on the street. [1] On 10 March 2020, an Uber driver was arrested when a viral video forcibly removing a Chinese passenger in Cairo's Maadi district. The passenger was thought to have the coronavirus. The incident caused an uproar among Egyptians when the video was uploaded. Some Egyptians visited the Chinese man in his hotel room. [2] Violence toward foreign people was reported during the pandemic. Some local people attacked foreign people. The attackers published a number of photos of them under social media and linked them to the Covid-19. [3] 
The COVID-19 pandemic has effected the mental health of African Americans . There has been a increase in the African American suicide rate since the COVID-19 pandemic . [1] More African Americans have commit suicide than whites during the pandemic. [2] 
The pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 has caused a large number of conspiracy theories and misinformation about where the pandemic started, how serious it is and the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. [1] [2] [3] According to the World Health Organization , the pandemic was also an infodemic , with misinformation spreading like disease. [2] This was because social media let information spread quickly, because celebrities sometimes repeated conspiracy theories, and because many people were locked down at home without much else to listen to.  When doctors or government officials went on television to say these conspiracy theories were wrong, that only made people think the conspiracy theories were important enough for doctors and officials to talk about. [4] One group of scientists said governments could use conspiracy theories to distract people from real problems. [5] Fake information has been spread through social media, [6] text messages, [7] and mass media , [8] including the state media of countries such as China, [9] [10] Russia, [11] [12] Iran, [13] and Turkmenistan. [2] [14] It has been spread by celebrities, politicians [15] [16] (including leaders in countries such as the United States, [17] [18] Iran, [19] and Brazil [20] ), and other important public figures. [21] Commercial scams have claimed to offer at-home tests and "miracle" cures. [22] [23] 
Operation Moonshot is a programme by the UK government to allow many people in England to be tested for COVID-19 as a way to allow large gatherings of people to happen there while maintaining control over the virus. According to the British Medical Journal , the programme aims to perform 10 million tests per day by 2021. People are worried about it because, as a leaked government document says, it is thought it may cost £100bn, which is about three-quarters of what the NHS England costs every year. Statisticians say because any test can have inaccuracies, mass testing at this scale might cause hundreds of thousands of false positives a day, resulting in very large numbers of people being told they are infected when they are not infected. [1] 
Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is a COVID-19 vaccine , developed by BioNTech , Pfizer and Fosun Pharmaceutical. The vaccine is given by injection . It is an RNA vaccine made of nucleoside -modified mRNA which is meant to create spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 . [1] 
Remdesivir is a broad-spectrum antiviral medication created by the biopharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences . [1] It was designed to treat Ebola . As of 2020, remdesivir is being tested as a specific treatment for COVID-19 . It is being used for the sickest of patients during the pandemic . [2] It may shorten the time it takes to recover from the infection. [3] Treatment is given by injection into a vein . [4] [5] On May 1, the United States Food and Drug Administration gave doctors permission to use remdesivir on patients with COVID-19.  Ordinarily, the FDA would test remdesivir first to see if it worked on patients with COVID-19, but because of the COVID-19 pandemic, they told doctors they could start using the drug before the tests were finished. In October 2020, the National Institutes of Health told the world the results of its tests: They studied 11,000 people and found that remdesivir did not help keep COVID-19 patients alive.  Gilead and some scientists said the results of the tests might not be correct. [6] 
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a larger effect more than the disease itself. As the SARS-CoV-2 virus has spread around the globe, many people have begun to think about the economic effects such as the decreased business and unemployment. [1] The pandemic caused the largest global recession in history , with more than a third of the global population at the time being placed on lockdown . [2] Supply shortages were expected to affect a number of sectors due to panic buying , increased usage of goods to during the pandemic, and people raising up prices on needed products such as masks, toilet paper, plastic gloves and hand sanitizer . [3] Reports of lack of food or groceries were said. [4] [5] [6] The pandemic also caused many social events to be pushed back such as concert delays and movie release dates. Many movie theaters are being put out of business. There was an increase in gleaning , meaning people going to farms to pick up food plants left over on the ground after a harvest.  Because restaurants and other food businesses canceled their orders, farmers had more extra crops than usual.  People formed new organizations to find farmers with extra food, organize people to collect it, and transport it to food banks and other places where people could get to it. [7] Global stock markets fell on 24 February 2020 due to a significant rise in the number of COVID-19 cases outside mainland China. [8] [9] By 28 February 2020, stock markets worldwide saw their largest single-week declines since the 2008 financial crisis . [10] [11] [12] Global stock markets crashed in March 2020 . [13] 
A stay-at-home order (North America) or a movement control order (Southeast Asia) is an order from a government to lower/end movements of a population as a mass quarantine move for stopping an epidemic , or pandemic . This is done by ordering residents to stay home except for essential tasks or to work in essential businesses. In many cases, outdoor activities are allowed. Nonessential businesses are either closed or made to working from home. [1] In some regions, it has added a curfew [2] or called a shelter-in-place order , [3] but it is not to be confused with a shelter in place situation. [4] Similar measures have been used around the world, but the term lockdown is used instead. [5] [6] 
Together at Home (also known as One World: Together at Home ) was a virtual concert series organised by Global Citizen and curated by singer Lady Gaga , in support of the World Health Organization .  
The first Variant Under Investigation in December 2020 ( VUI – 202012/01 ), [1] [a] also known as B.1.1.7 , [4] is a mutation of SARS-CoV-2 , the virus that causes COVID-19 . It was first detected in the United Kingdom in October 2020, [6] and it quickly began to spread by mid-December.  At the moment, [ when? ] scientists know that this variant can transmit faster than other SARS-CoV-2 variants. [7] 
 Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has a lot of variants. Some of them are important because of increased transmission and vaccines being less effective on them. [1] [2] This article discusses relevant variants of SARS-CoV-2 and mutations in these variants. The variant WIV04/2019 is most closely related to the original virus when it began infecting humans. [3] There are a lot of lineages of SARS-CoV-2. [4] Lineages are variants that are genetically the same. 
The White House Coronavirus Task Force was a United States Department of State task force that focuses on the spread and limiting of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). [1] The task force was created on January 29, 2020. [2] On February 26, 2020, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence was named to chair the task force, and Deborah Birx was named the response coordinator. [3] Other members have been added since the initial appointments. [4]   
In September and October 2020, multiple people at the White House tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 , the virus that causes COVID-19 . On September 16, it was reported that at least one unnamed staffer had tested positive. [2] On October 1, President Donald Trump , his wife Melania Trump , press advisor Hope Hicks , presidential campaign manager Bill Stepien , and former White House counselor Kellyanne Conway tested positive for the coronavirus. [3] [4] [5] [6] Claudia Conway, the daughter of Kellyanne Conway, announced on Oct 4 that she had tested positive as well. [7] On October 5, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany announced she had also tested positive. [8] Trump tested positive days after the first presidential debate against Joe Biden in Cleveland, Ohio . Around eleven people tested positive who worked at the debates in Cleveland. [9] Some of Trump's personal aides who prepared him for the debates also tested positive. [10] 
The Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences ( WIV) is a research institute. It was designed to study virology . It is run by the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).  The institute is in Jiangxia District, Wuhan , Hubei . It opened China's first biosafety level 4 (BSL–4) laboratory in 2015. [1] In January 2020, conspiracy theories spread which said that the the COVID-19 pandemic came from a virus made by the WIV. But scientific evidence says that the virus is natural. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] One story in the Washington Post said that US State Department had raised safety concerns about WIV's research on bat coronaviruses in 2018. [7] In April 2020, U.S. intelligence officials looked into reports the virus may have started by an accident by WIV scientists studying bats. [8] [9] [10] [11] Experts do not believe the virus escaped from the institute. [12] [13] One expert said that up to seven million people in Southeast Asia are infected each year with bat coronaviruses. He said there are probably only about six people who work with the viruses at the institute.  It does not make sense that virus came from one of these of people compared with the millions of other people affected by bats. The staff at the Wuhan Institute of Virology were trained at US labs and follow high safety standards. The evidence shows that this is not a laboratory accident. The WIV started in 1956 as the Wuhan Microbiology Laboratory under the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). In 1961, it became the South China Institute of Microbiology, and in 1962 was renamed Wuhan Microbiology Institute. In June 1978 it was named Wuhan Institute of Virology. [14]  
Coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID-19 ) is an infectious disease caused by SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) , [8] a virus closely related to the SARS virus . [9] [10] [11] The disease is the cause of the COVID-19 pandemic . [12] [13] Those who get the disease might get a fever , dry cough , fatigue (tiredness) and shortness of breath. A sore throat, runny nose or sneezing is less common. In very bad cases, they can even get a much worse fever, fewer white blood cells , and loss of appetite. They might cough up blood, and have kidney failure . People with this disease can get pneumonia and multi-organ failure if they are weak, old, or are already sick. [12] [13] There are people who are called asymptomatic carriers , which means that they did not have all or some of the symptoms of the virus. This is very dangerous since they may not know that they have the virus and can give it to other people without knowing it. The countries with the most sick people are the USA, India and Brazil. COVID-19 virus travels from person to person through the air like the common cold does. Scientists think the virus is not able to hang in the air a long time and go far like the measles virus does. [14]  
SARS coronavirus 2 ( SARS-CoV-2 ) is a positive-sense , single-stranded RNA coronavirus which causes the disease COVID-19 . [2] It used to be known as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by the World Health Organization (WHO). [3] [4] The virus started the 2019–20 coronavirus outbreak . [5] [6] [7] The first suspected cases were reported to the WHO on December 31, 2019. [8] [9] Many early cases of this new coronavirus were linked to Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, a large seafood and animal market in Wuhan , China. The virus may have come from infected animals. It is not certain that this place was the source of the pandemic . [10] The genetic material of this virus showed many similarities to SARS-CoV (79.5%) [11] and bat coronaviruses (96%). [11] This means the virus may have originally come from bats . [12] [13] [14] Scientists did more experiments that showed the virus probably went from bats to an intermediate host , meaning another animal in between bats and humans.  The viruses in that other animal changed over time until they could infect humans.  Scientists are close to sure that the original animal was a bat but not sure what the intermediate animal was. [15] Some scientists think it could have been a pangolin because there are coronaviruses that live in pangolins even though they are not exactly the same as SARS-CoV-2 or the ones in bats. [16] Pangolins are an endangered species and buying, selling or moving them from place to place is illegal in China and many other countries.  But their scales are an ingredient in many traditional Chinese medicines , so they are often sold on the black market . [17] Although SARS-CoV-2 began in bats, scientists noticed that the bats do not get sick and die from it.  They think this is because the bats have very careful immune systems that fight the virus without causing inflammation .  Scientists are studying bats because of this. [18] [19]  
The 2020 stock market crash is a global stock market crash that began on 20 February 2020 during the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic . [1] [2] [3] The Dow Jones Industrial Average , S&P 500 Index , and the NASDAQ-100 all fell into short-term decline on 27 February during one of the worst trading weeks since the financial crisis of 2007–08 . [4] [5] Markets over the following week (2–6 March) became extremely bad, with swings of 3% or more being made per daily session (except for 6 March). [6] [7] On 9 March, all three Wall Street indices fell more than 7% and most global markets reported severe losses, due to the response of the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic and the Russia–Saudi Arabia oil price war . [8] [9] This became known as Black Monday , and at the time was the worst drop since the Great Recession in 2008. [10] [11] Three days after Black Monday there was another drop, Black Thursday , where stocks across Europe and North America fell more than 9%.  
The 501Y.V2 variant , also known as South African COVID-19 variant , is a variant of the SARS-CoV-2 , the virus that causes COVID-19 . It is one of several SARS-CoV-2 variants. It was first detected in the Nelson Mandela Bay [1] metropolitan area of the Eastern Cape province of South Africa . On 23 December 2020, the United Kingdom health minister Matt Hancock said that two people who had travelled from South Africa to the United Kingdom were infected with the 501.V2. [2] On 28 December, the variant was detected in two people in Switzerland [3] and one in Finland . [4] The United States reported its first cases of the variant in the U.S. state of South Carolina . [5]   
Abenomask is a Japanese political word named after Shinzo Abe . [1] It is used in Japan for two meanings: [2] [3] [4] [5] Abenomask-like actions are taken in other regions including Spain [6] and the United States [7] etc.  
African Americans are more likely to catch COVID-19 compared to their white counterparts. [1] African Americans are also more likely to die from the disease. [2] African Americans are less likely to get vaccinated . [3]  
Black Thursday [1] was a global stock market crash on March 12, 2020 as part of the greater 2020 stock market crash . Global stock markets suffered the greatest single-day fall since the 1987 stock market crash . [2] Following Black Monday three days earlier, Black Thursday was caused by the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic and a lack of investor confidence in United States President Donald Trump after he added a 30-day travel ban against the Schengen Area . [3]  
Coronaviruses are a group of RNA viruses . [5] [6] They cause diseases in birds and mammals , including humans . These diseases can be mild, or they can be fatal. In humans and birds, they cause respiratory tract infections. Mild illnesses in humans include some cases of the common cold (which is also caused by other viruses, for example rhinoviruses ). More lethal varieties can cause SARS , MERS , and COVID-19 . They are enveloped viruses with a positive-sense RNA genome . [7] The genome size of coronaviruses is about 26 to 32 kilobases, [8] which is extraordinarily large for an RNA virus . There are four major groups of coronaviruses, called alpha, beta, gamma and delta. The most famous coronavirus is one of the betas, the kind that causes Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in humans. The name "coronavirus" comes from the Latin word corona , meaning "crown" or "halo", and refers to how virions look under an electron microscopy (E.M.). [9] They have a fringe of large, bulbous surface projections looking like a crown. This morphology is created by the viral spike (S) peplomers , which are proteins on the surface of the virus. They decide which cells the virus can infect.  
COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access , abbreviated as COVAX , is a global program that helps give COVID-19 vaccines to people living in poor countries led by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance ,  the World Health Organization (WHO), the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), and others. [1] By 15 July 2020, 165 countries – representing 60% of the human population – had joined COVAX. [2]  
The COVID-19 Advisory Board was announced in November 2020 by then President-elect of the United States Joe Biden as part of his presidential transition . It is co-chaired by physicians David A. Kessler , Marcella Nunez-Smith , and Vivek Murthy and comprises 13 health experts. The goal of the advisory board is to create ideas and rules on how to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States during Biden's transition period. The board was dissolved when Biden was inaugurated on January 20, 2021 and was replaced with the White House COVID-19 Response Team . University of Chicago ( JD )  
COVID-19 pandemic caused many governments to limit the spread of the disease by adding stay-at-home orders , curfews , quarantines , cordons sanitaires and similar societal restrictions. [1] By April 2020, about half of the world's population was under some form of lockdown, with more than 3.9 billion people in more than 90 countries or territories having been asked or ordered to stay at home by their governments. [2]  
The COVID-19 pandemic , also called the coronavirus pandemic , is a current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). [1] [6] [b] The outbreak started in Wuhan , Hubei , China, in December 2019. The World Health Organization (WHO) called it a pandemic on 11 March 2020. [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses gave the virus its name. As of February 19, 2021, more than 110 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in more than 188 countries and territories. More than two million people have died of COVID-19, [12] and more than 85 million people have defeated, or recovered from the disease. [12] [13] [14] The virus usually moves from one person to another with small drops made when coughing [15] [16] or sneezing . [17] It mostly spreads when people are close to each other, which is why social distancing is encouraged. Coronavirus can also spread when people touch a surface with the virus, and then they touch their face. [16] [17] Common symptoms include fever , cough, and trouble breathing. [18] The illness can worsen with pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome . [19] As of January 2021, a number of vaccines for COVID-19 have been developed, but only a few have been approved as safe for use. The first vaccine to be approved was created by Pfizer and BioNTech , [20] followed by the Oxford / AstraZeneca [21] vaccine. Vaccine distribution has begun in many countries in Europe, North America, South America and Asia. [22] The United Kingdom was the first western country to administer a COVID-19 vaccine. [23] No antiviral medicine for COVID-19 is available. [24] Doctors usually give patients supportive therapy instead. [25] People can avoid spreading the virus by regularly washing their hands, covering their mouth when coughing, maintaining distance from other people , staying away from crowds, wearing medical or cloth face coverings, and being alone for people who think they are infected, also known as quarantining . [24] The outbreak might be from a coronavirus that usually lives in bats . This infected another animal, possibly a pangolin . It then changed inside that other animal until it could infect humans. [26] It originated at a wet market Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market and is linked to China’s wild animal meat trade. Live foxes , crocodiles , wolf pups, giant salamanders , snakes , rats , peacocks , porcupines , koalas and game meats were on the menu at the market. [27] A 55-year-old person from Hubei province was the first human to contract the virus on November 17, 2019. [28] A 61-year-old man who was a regular customer at the market was the first person to die from the virus on January 11, 2020. [29] The exact origin of the virus is still unknown since the market in Wuhan sold a variety of live wild animals in cages. Chinese tourists have spread the virus by traveling to other countries and made it a worldwide pandemic. [30] Racism and xenophobia against Chinese people and Asians increased during the pandemic.  
The first case of COVID-19 in Africa was reported in Egypt on February 14, 2020.  
Deaths by county per 100,000 inhabitants as of 27 August 2020 The COVID-19 pandemic was confirmed to have reached Albania on 8 March 2020 , a father and son who had travelled from Florence , Italy . [1] As of 10 September 2020, there are 10,860 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Albania . [2] After the first case was reported on 8 March, the Ministry of Health and Social Protection stated that a total of 65 people had been tested for COVID-19 , 2 of whom were positive the following day. [3]  
The COVID-19 pandemic in Antarctica is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID-19 ) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS-CoV-2 ). Antarctica was the last continent to have confirmed cases of COVID-19 and was one of the last regions of the world affected by the pandemic. [1] [2] [3] The first cases were reported in December 2020, almost a year after the first cases of COVID-19 were seen in China. [4]  
The COVID-19 pandemic in Australia began on 25 January 2020, in Victoria . A man who had returned from Wuhan , China, tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 . [2] The Australian government stopped all non-residents from entering the country on 20 March. [3] Social distancing rules were put in place on 21 March. The state governments closed "non-essential" services. [4] [5] This included social gathering places such as hotels and clubs, but not businesses such as construction, manufacturing and many retail stores. [6] The number of new cases grew sharply, until reaching about 350 per day on 22 March. The numbers stayed around 350, and then started falling at the beginning of April. At the end of April it was under 20 cases per day. [7] As of 15 February 2021, there were 28,098 cases and 908 deaths in Australia. A virus that caused a respiratory illness was first seen in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019. It reported to the World Health Organisation (WHO) on 31 December 2019. WHO declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January, and a pandemic on 11 March.  
The COVID-19 pandemic was confirmed to have reached Bosnia and Herzegovina on 5 March 2020 in Banja Luka, who had been in Italy during the COVID-19 pandemic . Later the same day, a second case who was the son of the first case. [1] On 21 March 2020, the first death in the country from COVID-19 was announced in a hospital in Bihać . The patient was an elderly woman who had been hospitalized two days before. As of 13 May 2020, in Bosnia and Herzegovina there were 2182 confirmed coronavirus cases, of which 1168 were in Republika Srpska , [2] [3] 994 in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina , [4] [5] and 20 in Brčko District . [6] On 17 March 2020, the Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina declared a state of emergency in all of Bosnia and Herzegovina. [7]  
The COVID-19 pandemic in Canada is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID-19 ) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS-CoV-2 ). The disease was confirmed to have reached Canada on January 27, 2020, after a man who had returned to Toronto from Wuhan , Hubei , China, tested positive. As of September 10, 2020 [update] , there have been over 134,000 confirmed cases, 118,000 recoveries and 9,000 deaths in the country. [2] The Government of Canada says that around 11,000–22,000 deaths could happen over the course of the pandemic. [3] Most of those cases are in Canada's most populous provinces, Ontario (19,598 cases, 1,540 deaths) [4] and Quebec (36,150 cases, 2,725 deaths). [5] Confirmed cases have been reported in all of Canada's provinces and territories, with the exception of Nunavut . An additional 13 cases involve citizens from the Grand Princess cruise ship. [6] [7] [8] [9]  
The COVID-19 pandemic in Eritrea is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID-19 ) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS-CoV-2 ). On 21 March, the first case in Eritrea was confirmed in Asmara .  
The COVID-19 pandemic in Fiji is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID-19 ) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS-CoV-2 ). The first case of the disease in Fiji was reported on 19 March 2020. As of 6 July 2020 [update] , the country has had a total of 19 cases from the islands of Viti Levu and Vanua Levu as of which 18 have recovered. On 6 July, Fiji confirmed its nineteenth COVID-19 case. A 66-year-old Fijian citizen who had returned from India. He was transferred at Nadi hospital to be quarantined. [1]  
The COVID-19 pandemic was first detected in the U.S. state of Florida on March 1, 2020.  
The COVID-19 pandemic was first detected in the U.S. state of Georgia on March 2, 2020.  
The COVID-19 pandemic was first detected in the U.S. state of Mississippi on March 12, 2020.  
The COVID-19 pandemic was confirmed to have spread to Montenegro when its first case was confirmed on 17 March 2020, [1] [2] making it the last European country to register a case of SARS-CoV-2 . [3] As of 10 September 2020, [update] the total number of cases in Montenegro is 6,222. [4] On 24 May 2020, 68 days after the first case was recorded in Montenegro, it became the first corona-free country in Europe. [5] [6] Montenegro had 0 active cases from 24 May until 14 June when the first imported case was reported.  
The COVID-19 pandemic was first detected in the U.S. state of New York in February 2020.  
The first case of COVID-19 in New Zealand during the 2019–20 COVID-19 pandemic was reported on 28 February 2020. As of 14 May 2020 [update] , the country has a total of 1,497 cases, of which 65 are currently active, and 21 people have died from the virus. [1] All borders and entry ports of New Zealand were closed to all non-residents at 11:59 pm on 19 March 2020, with returning citizens and residents being required to self-isolate. Since 10 April, all New Zealanders returning from overseas must go into two weeks of quarantine . A four-level alert level system was added on 21 March to manage the outbreak within New Zealand. On 16 March, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern called for an end to public gatherings of more than 500 people and warned that the outbreak could lead to a recession greater than the 2008 global financial crisis . [2] [3]  
The first confirmed case relating to the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria was announced on February 27 2020, when an Italian citizen in Lagos tested positive for the virus SARS-CoV-2 . [1] [2] On March 9, 2020, a second case of the virus was reported in Ewekoro , Ogun State , in a Nigerian citizen who had contact with the Italian citizen. [3] On March 23, there were ten new cases: six in Lagos State, three in the FCT and one in Edo State . [4] They also confirmed their first death, a 67-year-old Suleiman Achimugu. [5] [6] Nigeria is Africa's largest economy, and it has a large oil industry.  It was hit hard when oil prices fell below zero in spring 2020 because of the pandemic. [7]  
The COVID-19 pandemic was confirmed to have reached Oceania on 25 January 2020 with the first confirmed case reported in Melbourne , Australia . [1] It has since spread elsewhere in the region, [2] although many small Pacific island nations have thus far avoided the outbreak by closing their international borders. As of 6 July, ten Oceania sovereign states have yet to report a case - Kiribati , Marshall Islands , Federated State of Micronesia , Nauru , Palau , Samoa , Solomon Islands , Tonga , Tuvalu and Vanuatu .  
The COVID-19 pandemic was confirmed to have reached Papua New Guinea on 20 March 2020. [2] On 4 May, all known cases recovered. [1] On 20 March, the first case in Papua New Guinea was confirmed. [2] On 7 April, Papua New Guinea confirmed its second case of COVID-19. [3] On 4 May, acting Health Secretary Dr Paison Dakulala reported that all known cases have recovered, but stresses that they don't know what they are fighting. 2,400 tests have been carried out with the bulk in Port Moresby . [1]  
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic spread to the United Kingdom in late January 2020. By 13 May there had been  229,705 confirmed cases [nb 4] and  33,186 deaths overall. [nb 2] More than 90% of those dying had underlying illnesses or were over 60 years old. The infection rate was higher in care homes than in the community. There were large regional difference in the outbreak's severity. The outbreak in London had the highest total number and the most infections. England and Wales were the UK countries with the highest recorded death rate per head, and Northern Ireland had the lowest. The Department of Health and Social Care created a public health campaign to help slow the virus's spread, and began posting daily updates in early February. In February, the Heath Secretary , Matt Hancock , proposed the Health Protection (Coronavirus) Regulations 2020 . Hospitals set up drive-through screening (testing for the disease). The Chief Medical Officer for England, Chris Whitty , created a four-stage strategy to tackle the outbreak: contain, delay, research and mitigate (help, lessen).  
The coronavirus recession , also known as the Great Lockdown [1] or Great Shutdown , [2] is an ongoing major global economic recession affecting the world economy in early 2020 [3] [4] [5] during the COVID-19 pandemic . [6] [7] The recession has caused the largest economic downturn since the Great Depression . [8] On 14 April 2020, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) reported that all of the G7 nations had already entered or were entering into what was called a "deep recession". [9] The IMF has stated that the economic decline is "far worse" than that of the Great Recession in 2009. [10] [11] [12] [13] The pandemic has led to more than a third of the world's population being placed on lockdown to stop the spread of COVID-19 . [14] This has caused severe economic downfalls for economies across the world, [15] following soon after a global economic slowdown during 2019 that saw a lowering numbers in stock markets worldwide. [16] [17] The United Nations (UN) predicted in April 2020 that global unemployment will wipe out 6.7 per cent of working hours globally in the second quarter of 2020—equivalent to 195 million full-time workers. [18]  
COVID-19 testing can help find the SARS-CoV-2 virus. There are two types of test; one can find the virus (i.e. Polymerase chain reaction , also called PCR) and the other that can find antibodies produced in response to infection . An accurate mortality rate of the disease and the level of herd immunity in the population can be found from the results of these tests. However, it is still not known how long immunity will last, and how effective it will be. [1] Due to limited testing, as of March 2020, no countries had reliable data of the virus.

A COVID-19 vaccine is any of the vaccines used against the Coronavirus Disease 2019 ( COVID-19 pandemic ). In July 2020, more than 150 vaccines were being developed in different laboratories. [1] Two mRNA vaccines , one by Pfizer and one by Moderna , were approved late in 2020. Both are over 90% effective. [2] A few vaccines also went into use in early 2021. Several countries plan to give the vaccine to many people, but their plans are different. The United Kingdom plans to use its National Health Service .  Canada plans to use its military. The United States plans to send vaccines to all fifty states and then let the state governments each make their own system. [3] The United Kingdom approved the Pfizer vaccine before the European Union or United States did. They began giving it to people on December 8. [4] The United States began giving people the vaccine on December 14, starting with health care workers in New York City . [5] By April 2021, several vaccines were in use around the world and hundreds of millions of people had been vaccinated. In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect a vaccine against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative virus, to become available in less than 18 months. [6] The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) – which is organizing a US$2 billion worldwide fund for fast investment and creation of vaccine candidates [7] – indicated in April that a vaccine may be available under emergency use protocols in less than 12 months or by early 2021. [8] On 4 May 2020, the WHO organized a telethon (fundraising event broadcasted via televisions) to raise US$8 billion from forty countries to support rapid development of vaccines to prevent COVID-19 infections and deaths. [9] The United States government started Operation Warp Speed to develop a vaccine by January 2021. [1]  
Brett E. Crozier is an American naval officer. When he was captain of the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt , he noticed that some of his crew had caught COVID-19 , a serious disease that affects the lungs and breathing.  Late in March, 2020, he wrote letters asking for permission to send his sick sailors off his ship to Guam .  These letters were found and printed in a newspaper.  A few days later, the Navy fired Crozier as the captain of the Theodore Roosevelt but did not fire him from the Navy entirely. [1] [2] [3] In late April, some leaders in the Navy asked that Crozier be reinstated and sent back as captain of the Theodore Roosevelt . [4] Brett Crozier is from Santa Rosa , California .  He graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1992 and became a pilot for the Navy in 1994.  He fought in Iraq in 2003.  He later earned a Master's Degree in National Security and Strategic Studies at the Naval War College .  He served in many different positions in the Navy, including Executive Officer of the USS Ronald Reagan .  Brett Crozier was captain of the USS Blue Ridge from June 2017 to November 2018. [5] He wrote more than twenty copies of a four-page letter, dated March 30, 2020.  He addressed it to senior officials in the military.  He asked for permission to send 1000 of his crew off the ship.  The ship had more than 4000 people on it.  Someone found his messages and they were printed in the newspaper San Francisco Chronicle on March 31, 2020.  
Diamond Princess is a British-registered cruise ship owned and operated by Princess Cruises . She began operation in March 2004 and mainly cruises in Asia during the northern hemisphere summer and Australia during the southern hemisphere summer. Diamond Princess was built in Nagasaki, Japan , by Mitsubishi Industries . There have been two known outbreaks of infectious disease on the ship – an outbreak of gastroenteritis caused by norovirus in 2016 and an outbreak of the COVID-19 coronavirus in 2020. [1] At least 712 out of the 3,711 passengers and crew were infected, [1] and fourteen have died. [2]  
The Farmers to Families Food Box program is set up by the United States ' government during the COVID-19 pandemic to help get fresh food from farmers to consumers. The food is put into "family-sized" boxes containing produce, dairy products and/or meat. The programs is run by the USDA ( Department of Agriculture ).  It is part of the government's general response to the pandemic, called the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program  run by the USDA.  It was announced on April 15, 2020. According to the program's home page, over 70,000,000 boxes were invoiced between the start date and then end of August. [1] As of the second week of August 2020, the program's budget was three billion dollars. [2] The USDA buys the produce from farmers. Then the food is sent to local packaging companies.  These companies distribute the packages to local organizations such as NGOs and religious orga nizations. The program sets no restrictions on which families may pick of the boxes. [3] The program has been positively received.  However, there has been some criticism.  For example, the boxes weigh forty pounds.  This can make it difficult for people without a car to get the boxes home.  Also, the program initially only had boxes with produce, dairy products and meat.  Since some people do not eat dairy or meat products, this created a problem. [4] It has also been stated that specialty-crop farmers have not been helped enough by the program. [5]  
Anthony Stephen Fauci ( / ˈ f aʊ tʃ i / ; born December 24, 1940) is an American immunologist . He works for the National Institutes of Health of the  United States. He is the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). He became well known in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States for his information about preventing the spread of disease . He has been called "the nation’s leading expert on infectious diseases". [1] He is a member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force on the 2020 coronavirus pandemic . On December 4, 2020, newly elected President Joe Biden announced that Fauci would serve as Chief Medical Advisor to the President in the Biden administration. [2]   
Flattening the curve is a public health strategy to slow down the spread of the COVID-19 virus during the COVID-19 pandemic . The curve being flattened is the epidemic curve , a representation of the number of infected people needing health care over time. During an epidemic, a health care system can break down when the number of people infected passes the health care system's ability to take care of them. Flattening the curve means slowing the spread of the epidemic so that the peak number of people requiring care at a time is reduced, and the health care system does not pass its capacity. Flattening the curve relies on techniques such as quarantine , stay at home orders , and social distancing .  
Gam-COVID-Vac ( Russian : Гам-КОВИД-Вак , romanized: Gam-KOVID-Vak ), trade-named Sputnik V , is a COVID-19 vaccine created by the Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology , and registered on 11 August 2020 by the Russian Ministry of Health . [1] [2] [3] Gam-COVID-Vac has been approved for distribution in Russia . [1] [4] [5]  
The Josh Fight was a viral internet meme and pretend fight at Air Park in Lincoln, Nebraska , on April 24, 2021. [1] [2] A college student named Josh Swain from Tucson, Arizona had the idea for the Josh Fight.  He was bored because of the COVID-19 pandemic , and this gave him the idea. [3] He talked about it on April 24, 2020. After a screenshot of a Facebook Messenger group chat involving several users named Josh spread widely on the internet , many people learned about the Josh Fight. Swain told other people named Josh Swain to meet at a set of coordinates , where they would fight for the right to be the only person to be called "Josh Swain." Later, more people with the first name Josh became interested.  Swain meant this as a joke, but several hundred people showed up on the day of the event. Despite the title, there was no violence involved and the gathering was lighthearted.  Fighting involved playing rock, paper, scissors and hitting each other with pool noodles made of light foam.  The fighters raised over $7000 for charity.  A four-year-old fighter, Joshua Vinson Jr., nicknamed "Little Josh," won the fight. [4]  
This is a list of notable people who died from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), coming from the virus SARS-CoV-2 that first spread during the global pandemic . 2020: January · February · March · April · May · June · July · August · September · October · November · December 2021: January · February · March · April · May This table is arranged by death date, earliest first. To sort it by name, age, occupation, or place of death, or to have the most recent deaths listed first, click the column headings.  
The COVID-19 pandemic started in the city of Wuhan, China in December 2019. It has led to increased acts of prejudice , xenophobia , discrimination , racism and violence against people of Southeast Asian , Hispanic , East Asian , Native American , biracial and black people all over the world. With the spread of the pandemic and in formation of hotspots, like those in Asia , Europe and the Americas , discrimination against people from these hotspots was reported. According to the Embassy of Japan in Cairo , store clerks were hesitating to serve Japanese customers. "Corona" became a new slur by which to abuse Japanese people on the street. [1] On 10 March 2020, an Uber driver was arrested when a viral video forcibly removing a Chinese passenger in Cairo's Maadi district. The passenger was thought to have the coronavirus. The incident caused an uproar among Egyptians when the video was uploaded. Some Egyptians visited the Chinese man in his hotel room. [2] Violence toward foreign people was reported during the pandemic. Some local people attacked foreign people. The attackers published a number of photos of them under social media and linked them to the Covid-19. [3]  
The COVID-19 pandemic has effected the mental health of African Americans . There has been a increase in the African American suicide rate since the COVID-19 pandemic . [1] More African Americans have commit suicide than whites during the pandemic. [2]  
The pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 has caused a large number of conspiracy theories and misinformation about where the pandemic started, how serious it is and the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. [1] [2] [3] According to the World Health Organization , the pandemic was also an infodemic , with misinformation spreading like disease. [2] This was because social media let information spread quickly, because celebrities sometimes repeated conspiracy theories, and because many people were locked down at home without much else to listen to.  When doctors or government officials went on television to say these conspiracy theories were wrong, that only made people think the conspiracy theories were important enough for doctors and officials to talk about. [4] One group of scientists said governments could use conspiracy theories to distract people from real problems. [5] Fake information has been spread through social media, [6] text messages, [7] and mass media , [8] including the state media of countries such as China, [9] [10] Russia, [11] [12] Iran, [13] and Turkmenistan. [2] [14] It has been spread by celebrities, politicians [15] [16] (including leaders in countries such as the United States, [17] [18] Iran, [19] and Brazil [20] ), and other important public figures. [21] Commercial scams have claimed to offer at-home tests and "miracle" cures. [22] [23]  
Operation Moonshot is a programme by the UK government to allow many people in England to be tested for COVID-19 as a way to allow large gatherings of people to happen there while maintaining control over the virus. According to the British Medical Journal , the programme aims to perform 10 million tests per day by 2021. People are worried about it because, as a leaked government document says, it is thought it may cost £100bn, which is about three-quarters of what the NHS England costs every year. Statisticians say because any test can have inaccuracies, mass testing at this scale might cause hundreds of thousands of false positives a day, resulting in very large numbers of people being told they are infected when they are not infected. [1]  
Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is a COVID-19 vaccine , developed by BioNTech , Pfizer and Fosun Pharmaceutical. The vaccine is given by injection . It is an RNA vaccine made of nucleoside -modified mRNA which is meant to create spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 . [1]  
Remdesivir is a broad-spectrum antiviral medication created by the biopharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences . [1] It was designed to treat Ebola . As of 2020, remdesivir is being tested as a specific treatment for COVID-19 . It is being used for the sickest of patients during the pandemic . [2] It may shorten the time it takes to recover from the infection. [3] Treatment is given by injection into a vein . [4] [5] On May 1, the United States Food and Drug Administration gave doctors permission to use remdesivir on patients with COVID-19.  Ordinarily, the FDA would test remdesivir first to see if it worked on patients with COVID-19, but because of the COVID-19 pandemic, they told doctors they could start using the drug before the tests were finished. In October 2020, the National Institutes of Health told the world the results of its tests: They studied 11,000 people and found that remdesivir did not help keep COVID-19 patients alive.  Gilead and some scientists said the results of the tests might not be correct. [6]  
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a larger effect more than the disease itself. As the SARS-CoV-2 virus has spread around the globe, many people have begun to think about the economic effects such as the decreased business and unemployment. [1] The pandemic caused the largest global recession in history , with more than a third of the global population at the time being placed on lockdown . [2] Supply shortages were expected to affect a number of sectors due to panic buying , increased usage of goods to during the pandemic, and people raising up prices on needed products such as masks, toilet paper, plastic gloves and hand sanitizer . [3] Reports of lack of food or groceries were said. [4] [5] [6] The pandemic also caused many social events to be pushed back such as concert delays and movie release dates. Many movie theaters are being put out of business. There was an increase in gleaning , meaning people going to farms to pick up food plants left over on the ground after a harvest.  Because restaurants and other food businesses canceled their orders, farmers had more extra crops than usual.  People formed new organizations to find farmers with extra food, organize people to collect it, and transport it to food banks and other places where people could get to it. [7] Global stock markets fell on 24 February 2020 due to a significant rise in the number of COVID-19 cases outside mainland China. [8] [9] By 28 February 2020, stock markets worldwide saw their largest single-week declines since the 2008 financial crisis . [10] [11] [12] Global stock markets crashed in March 2020 . [13]  
A stay-at-home order (North America) or a movement control order (Southeast Asia) is an order from a government to lower/end movements of a population as a mass quarantine move for stopping an epidemic , or pandemic . This is done by ordering residents to stay home except for essential tasks or to work in essential businesses. In many cases, outdoor activities are allowed. Nonessential businesses are either closed or made to working from home. [1] In some regions, it has added a curfew [2] or called a shelter-in-place order , [3] but it is not to be confused with a shelter in place situation. [4] Similar measures have been used around the world, but the term lockdown is used instead. [5] [6]  
Together at Home (also known as One World: Together at Home ) was a virtual concert series organised by Global Citizen and curated by singer Lady Gaga , in support of the World Health Organization .   
The first Variant Under Investigation in December 2020 ( VUI – 202012/01 ), [1] [a] also known as B.1.1.7 , [4] is a mutation of SARS-CoV-2 , the virus that causes COVID-19 . It was first detected in the United Kingdom in October 2020, [6] and it quickly began to spread by mid-December.  At the moment, [ when? ] scientists know that this variant can transmit faster than other SARS-CoV-2 variants. [7]  
 Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has a lot of variants. Some of them are important because of increased transmission and vaccines being less effective on them. [1] [2] This article discusses relevant variants of SARS-CoV-2 and mutations in these variants. The variant WIV04/2019 is most closely related to the original virus when it began infecting humans. [3] There are a lot of lineages of SARS-CoV-2. [4] Lineages are variants that are genetically the same.  
The White House Coronavirus Task Force was a United States Department of State task force that focuses on the spread and limiting of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). [1] The task force was created on January 29, 2020. [2] On February 26, 2020, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence was named to chair the task force, and Deborah Birx was named the response coordinator. [3] Other members have been added since the initial appointments. [4]    
In September and October 2020, multiple people at the White House tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 , the virus that causes COVID-19 . On September 16, it was reported that at least one unnamed staffer had tested positive. [2] On October 1, President Donald Trump , his wife Melania Trump , press advisor Hope Hicks , presidential campaign manager Bill Stepien , and former White House counselor Kellyanne Conway tested positive for the coronavirus. [3] [4] [5] [6] Claudia Conway, the daughter of Kellyanne Conway, announced on Oct 4 that she had tested positive as well. [7] On October 5, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany announced she had also tested positive. [8] Trump tested positive days after the first presidential debate against Joe Biden in Cleveland, Ohio . Around eleven people tested positive who worked at the debates in Cleveland. [9] Some of Trump's personal aides who prepared him for the debates also tested positive. [10]  
The Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences ( WIV) is a research institute. It was designed to study virology . It is run by the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).  The institute is in Jiangxia District, Wuhan , Hubei . It opened China's first biosafety level 4 (BSL–4) laboratory in 2015. [1] In January 2020, conspiracy theories spread which said that the the COVID-19 pandemic came from a virus made by the WIV. But scientific evidence says that the virus is natural. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] One story in the Washington Post said that US State Department had raised safety concerns about WIV's research on bat coronaviruses in 2018. [7] In April 2020, U.S. intelligence officials looked into reports the virus may have started by an accident by WIV scientists studying bats. [8] [9] [10] [11] Experts do not believe the virus escaped from the institute. [12] [13] One expert said that up to seven million people in Southeast Asia are infected each year with bat coronaviruses. He said there are probably only about six people who work with the viruses at the institute.  It does not make sense that virus came from one of these of people compared with the millions of other people affected by bats. The staff at the Wuhan Institute of Virology were trained at US labs and follow high safety standards. The evidence shows that this is not a laboratory accident. The WIV started in 1956 as the Wuhan Microbiology Laboratory under the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). In 1961, it became the South China Institute of Microbiology, and in 1962 was renamed Wuhan Microbiology Institute. In June 1978 it was named Wuhan Institute of Virology. [14] 
Medicine is the science that deals with diseases (illnesses) in humans and animals , the best ways to prevent diseases, and the best ways to return to a healthy condition. [1] People who practice medicine are most often called medical doctors or physicians. Often doctors work closely with nurses and many other types of health care professionals. Many doctors specialize in one kind of medical work. For example, pediatrics is the medical specialty about the health of children . [2] [3] In this specialty, the doctor is trained to provide anaesthesia and sedation. [4] This is important for surgeries and certain medical procedures. Anaesthesiologists also provide pre-operative assessments, ensuring the patient is safe during the operation and successfully awakens from anaesthesia after the operation. They assess for medical conditions and suitability for anaesthesia. They screen for risk factors prior to surgery and try to optimize the operative environment for the patient and the surgeon. They are the doctors who give epidurals during labor and delivery, provide spinal blocks, local nerve blocks, and general anaesthesia for procedures. They are the doctors who are especially trained in intubation (putting a tube into the lungs to help a person artificially breathe when the person is paralyzed and asleep during surgery). Hence, due to their skill in intubation, they are often the first line responders for emergencies. They help people who are in distress with their breathing, who have lost their airway or when their airway has become obstructed. A cardiologist is a doctor with special training on the heart. [5] [6] [7] [8] The doctor in this field ensures the heart is healthy and functions properly. The heart is a vital organ whose role is to pump blood to the rest of the body. The purpose of blood is to deliver oxygen to the tissues. Without the heart functioning well, our tissues and organs would die and not function properly. Cardiologists treat heart attacks, sudden cardiac arrests, arrhythmias (rhythm issues related to a faulty electrical system of the heart), heart failure (where the heart fails to pump blood forward properly) and many other heart related illnesses. They specialize in life saving procedures like cardiac stents and cardiac ablation. There is a subspecialty within cardiology called "Interventional cardiology." These are cardiologists who specialize in interventions or procedures to save the function of the heart, such as cardiac stenting or angiography . 
The second cholera pandemic is also known as the Asiatic cholera pandemic . It was a cholera pandemic that spread from India to the entire West Asia , then to the United Kingdom and the Americas , and then to China and Japan . The cause of cholera was not known until later in the 19th century. Cholera and typhus are bacterial diseases. Cholera spread by the absence of, or defective, sewage treatment or defective water supply systems. Typhus is spread by lice , chiggers and fleas .  
In 2020 and 2021, an ongoing outbreak of Avian influenza subtype H5N8 has been happening in poultry farms and in wild bird populations in several countries and continents. It has caused the cullings of millions of birds to prevent a pandemic similar to that of the H5N1 outbreak in 2008 . The first case of human transmission was reported by Russian authorities in February 2021, as several poultry farm workers tested positive for the virus. [1]   
The Abbott Laboratories [1] are an American pharmaceuticals and health care company. They have 90,000+ employees in over 130 countries. The headquarters are in North Chicago, Illinois . This organization was established by Wallace Calvin Abbott in 1888. Abbott's product line includes pharmaceuticals, nutritional, diagnostics, and vascular products. The company has made drugs for rheumatoid arthritis , diabetes and other conditions. The company makes glucose monitoring devices for diabetics. According to the Reuters report, Abbott acquired Alere for $4.48 billion, in April 2017. [2] In September 2017,  Abbott announced that it has received Food and Drug Administration clearance for a consumer version of its Freestyle Libre flash glucose monitor, which does not require people with diabetes to routinely prick their fingers to check the glucose levels. [3] [4] 
Abdominal obesity , also called central body obesity , is a condition involving excess fat surrounding the abdomen and an increase in waist size in humans. Obesity in this area is linked to Type 2 Diabetes , [1] insulin resistance and heart disease in humans of both genders.  
Abdominal pain (also called a stomach ache ) is a pain or ache in the abdomen . It can be caused by different things, including food poisoning , indigestion , constipation , gastritis , an ulcer , hunger , appendicitis , stomach cancer or diverticulitis .  
Ablutophobia is a fear of bathing , washing , or cleaning . [1] It is a type of specific phobia . It is most often seen in children and women.  
In dermatology , an abrasion is a damage to the skin that affects only the surface, generally not deeper than the epidermis . But it can give mild bleeding. Mild abrasions, also known as 'grazes' do not scar , but deep abrasions may lead to the development of scarring tissue. Abrasion injuries occur rather often when exposed skin comes into moving contact with a rough surface causing trauma to the upper layers of the epidermis. Such injuries , where caused by abrasive contact with textiles or carpet , are sometimes referred to as ' rug burn' or ' carpet burn' .  
Acral necrosis is a common symptom of the Black Death that causes skin to discolour black and can cause the area nearby to bleed . This is most common at the end of limbs (fingers, toes, ears etc.) 
Acrohobia is the fear of heights . People with acrophobia experience a fear or phobia when they are at a certain height, and they are being made aware of it. The word is derived from Ancient Greek akros - top, height, and phobia - fear.  People who do not suffer from acrophobia are said to have a head for heights . Vertigo is often used to describe a fear of heights.  
In medicine , an acute disease or condition either happens for a short time, as in acute infection , or doesn't last long. The word acute may often be confused by the general public to mean ' severe '. This is different: something can be acute but not severe. The word acute is in the name of many diseases, for example, severe acute respiratory syndrome or acute leukemia . Acute hospitals are hospitals which are meant for short-term medical and/or surgical treatment and care. The related medical speciality is called acute medicine . Subacute is described as between acute and chronic. An example is subacute fever symptoms or subacute endocarditis .  
Acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ), also known as acute myelogenous leukemia or acute nonlymphocytic leukemia ( ANLL ), is a cancer of the myeloid line of blood cells. It is the rapid growth of uncommon white blood cells that build up in the bone marrow and harm the production of normal blood cells . AML is the most common acute leukemia affecting adults. 
Acute radiation syndrome ( ARS ) also known as radiation poisoning , radiation sickness or radiation toxicity , is a syndrome or group of health effects which occur within months of exposure to high amounts of ionizing radiation . [1] [2] The term generally refers to acute (serious, rapid onset) problems rather than ones that develop after a prolonged period. [3] [4] [5] It is mainly damage to the blood , digestive system , and nervous system .  
Acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) is a type of respiratory failure caused by a massive widespread inflammation in the lungs . Symptoms include shortness of breath , rapid breathing , and bluish skin color. For those who survive, a short life span is common as a result. Causes may include sepsis , pancreatitis , trauma , pneumonia , and aspiration . [1] 
Amphetamine mixed salts (also known as amphetamine and dextroamphetamine mixed salts , amphetamine salt combo , or simply amphetamine salts ) is a medication used in the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy . [1] It is sold under the brand name Adderall . The drug contains a mixture of the salts of amphetamine and dextroamphetamine . Both of these salts act as stimulants . The drug therefore helps people stay alert and concentrate on what they are doing. The downside of this medication is decreased fatigue, and decreased appetite. The sustained-release (or extended-release) formulation is sold under the brand name Adderall XR. This formulation is designed to provide therapeutic effect and plasma concentrations. This is the same as taking two doses 4 hours apart. [2] The normal dosage of Adderall XR is 20 milligrams. Adderall is a DEA Schedule II controlled substances. Its Schedule II status indicates its potential for abuse and dependence. While it does have medicinal use, abuse of the drug may lead to an addiction, clinically termed a stimulant use disorder. [3]  
Adenoidectomy is the process of taking out a person's adenoids from the back of their throat through the process of surgery . They may be removed for several reasons, including difficulty breathing through the nose and having ear infections. The surgery is common in young kids. The procedure is usually performed using a substance called anaesthesia ( Greek for "without sensation "), and the substance puts a person to sleep when it is applied. Recovery time from the operation can vary from several hours to a few days. Adenoidectomy is usually done on young children because their adenoids were infected by a virus . If the disease was to be left alone, it would worsen. The affected person could have harder times breathing or hearing, and may possibly be killed from the disease. Normally functioning adenoids help maintain the body's healthy immune system during early childhood. They shrink when a person gets older. When a person becomes an adult , their adenoids completely disappear.  
Adjustment disorder happens when a person is unable to cope with or adjust to certain stressors. People who have adjustment disorder often have symptoms such as losing interest, being sad , crying, feeling anxious and constant worries. These symptoms are from outside stressors, although they resolve when individuals become used to the situations. The stressors may include, although are not limited to: hurricanes , being abused, accidents and traumatic events. This problem can happen at any age. In adults, however, adult women are diagnosed almost twice as often as men. [1]  
An adrenal tumor or adrenal mass [1] is any benign or malignant neoplasms of the adrenal gland . They are known to overproduce endocrine hormones . Adrenal cancer is when there are malignant adrenal tumors, and includes neuroblastoma , adrenocortical carcinoma and some adrenal pheochromocytomas . Most adrenal pheochromocytomas and all adrenocortical adenomas are benign tumors, which do not metastasize or destroy nearby tissues, but may cause significant health problems by unbalancing hormones. 
Adrenoleukodystrophy is a disease that is linked on the X chromosome . It is a result of fatty acid digestive enzymes not breaking up the fats . These fats build up in the brain . They damage the myelin that surrounds nerves . This can cause seizures and hyperactivity . It can also cause problems with speaking , listening and understanding verbal instructions . 
Adrenomyeloneuropathy is an inherited disorder .  It does not happen very often.  It is rare .  It is a form of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy . Leukodystrophy causes a disruption to the myelin covering that protects nerves .  
An airborne transmission is transmission of diseases through small particulates that can be passed through the air over time and distance. [1] Diseases that can be infected through airborne transmission may be viruses , bacteria , or fungi , and they may be spread through breathing, talking, coughing, sneezing, raising of dust, spraying of liquids or even flushing toilets . 
Alien Hand Syndrome (also known as anarchic hand , AHS or Doctor Strangeglove Syndrome ) is a condition that seems to cause a person's hand to move on its own. [1]  
Alprazolam , probably better known by its trade name Xanax , is a short-acting drug. The drug is used to treat people with anxiety disorders and panic attacks . Alprazolam is the most commonly misused benzodiazepine (the drug's class) in the United States ; but the majority of prescribed users do not develop a substance-use disorder. Alprazolam is a prescription drug in the United States. 
Alternative medicine describes practices used in place of conventional medical treatments. Some patients seek these practices along with conventional medicine . When the patient's medical doctor coordinates with an alternative medicine therapist, this is called "complementary medicine." [1] Alternative medicine includes practices that incorporate spiritual , metaphysical , or religious belief; non-evidence based practices, non-European medical traditions, or newly developed approaches to healing. Examples include acupuncture , chiropractic and homeopathy . 
Aminoglycosides are antibiotics used for gram negative infections. Gram-negative means that the bacteria which cause the infection don't hold the color of a particular dye (Crystal Violet) when they're tested. Since they are not absorbed from the gut, they are usually taken by an injection into the vain or muscle but they can be given as a cream or ointment to prevent and treat skin infections, as eye drops for eye infections, as ear drops for ear infections and as a pill for intestinal infections but not for other internal infections. Antibiotics from this family can be used in patients who are not able to take some regular antibiotics, such as Penicillin because of allergies.  The most common Aminoglycosides used as alternatives to Penicillin are Erythromycin (lit. Red fungus ) and Clarithromycin (lit. Yellow fungus ).  They're most commonly used in the treatment of bacterial infections, such as Bronchitis . Kanamycin A Amikacin 
Amniocentesis is the name of a medical test that is often performed when screening babies . The test consist of taking a little Amniotic fluid , and testing this fluid . This fluid contains tissue of the embryo or fetus , and allows to determine the sex . It also allows to find certain birth defects .  
Amphetamine is a synthetic drug . The drug is a stimulant : it can help people keep the focus and stay awake. It also decreases appetite and fatigue . Chemically, it is similar to methamphetamine . These drugs increase the level of dopamine and norepinephrine in the brain , which can create euphoria . [1] [2] The class of drugs containing amphetamine includes prescription drugs commonly used to treat attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It is also used to treat symptoms of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and the daytime drowsiness symptoms of narcolepsy , amongst others. Initially, amphetamine was more popularly used to reduce appetite and to control weight. Sometimes, the drug is used for fun or to boost performance.  Many different names are used for amphetamines.  They include Benzedrine and speed .  The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction reports the typical retail price of amphetamine in Europe varied between €3 and €15 ($4 to $21.55 USD ) a gram in half of the reporting countries. [3] The name amphetamine is derived from its chemical name: a lpha- m ethyl ph en et hyl amine .  
Amputation is the act of cutting off a part of the human body , sometimes because of medical reasons. In some countries, amputation of the hands, feet or other body parts was used as a form of punishment for people who committed crimes . A person who has had an arm or leg removed is known as an amputee.  
Amyloidosis is a rare and serious disease that could be fatal that is caused by accumulation of proteins in the form of abnormal, insoluble fibres, known as amyloid fibrils, within the tissues of the body. [1] [2] Amyloid deposits can be confined to only one part of the body or a single organ system in 'local amyloidosis' or they can be widely distributed in organs and tissues throughout the body in 'systemic amyloidosis'. The symptoms of amyloidosis are accordingly highly variable and confirmation of the presence of amyloid in the tissues can be challenging, so that diagnosis is often delayed. There are many different types of amyloidosis, each caused by formation of amyloid fibrils from different soluble precursor proteins in different patients. [2] [3] About 30 different proteins are known to form amyloid fibrils in humans [4] and amyloidosis is named and classified according to the identity of the respective fibril protein. [3] Though this disease being rare, many famous people have died from this disease such as: Martin McGuinness , David Lange , Robert Jordan and Robert P. Casey . 
Analgetics (one analgetic ) (or analgesics ) is a word for some drugs that are used to stop pain . [1] These are also known as painkillers . [2] There are several kinds of painkillers. All act on the nervous system . Some painkillers (such as opioids ) can make people addicted if they are taken for a long time. Some painkillers have side effects that can harm people when they take too much (e.g., too much paracetamol can be dangerous for the liver)  
Analytical psychology is the school of psychology that came from the ideas of Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung . Analytical psychology has two main parts:  
Anaphia , also known as tactile anesthesia , is a medical symptom in which there is a total or partial loss of the sense of touch. [1] Anaphia is a common symptom of spinal cord injury and neuropathy . 
An anaphrodisiac is something that makes the one who uses it less aroused . This can be a medicine , [1] a food or a procedure. [2] It is sometimes used to treat hypersexuals . [3] It is also used for an animal that is in heat. [4] Pills that lower the libido are sometimes called antaphrodisiacs . [5] 
An anesthesiologist (also anaesthesiologist ) is a doctor of medicine . An anesthesiologist ( American English ) or anaesthetist ( British English ) is a professional trained in anesthesia and perioperative medicine. Terminology varies between countries. The main jobs of an anesthesiologist are: The first anesthesiologist was John Snow (1813–1858).  
An anesthetic or anaesthetic is a substance that stops pain .  It makes people either stop hurting, or go completely to sleep during surgery .  Anesthetic can be rubbed onto the skin, given by injection ("shot"), or given as a gas to breathe .  The use of an anesthetic is called anaesthesia.  Anaesthesia blocks the pain during operations.  This lets patients undergo surgery and other procedures without the distress and pain they would normally feel.  It comes from Greek roots an-, "without" and aesthetos, "perceptible, able to feel". The modern anesthetic was created by Joseph Lister .  Before it, people sometimes used cocaine , alcohol , and other drugs. Modern anaesthesia is highly complex and often involves a combination of anaesthesia, analgesia and muscle relaxation to enable physicians to do their part. These three tasks are known as the triad of anaesthesia.  
Angiography or arteriography is the name for several imaging techniques to show the inside of blood vessels . These techniques include:  
Animal euthanasia ( euthanasia from Greek : εὐθανασία ; "good death") is the act of putting an animal to death or allowing it to die by without it facing extreme medical measures. Reasons for euthanasia include incurable (and especially painful) conditions or diseases, [1] lack of resources to continue supporting the animal, or laboratory test procedures. Euthanasia methods are designed to cause minimal pain and distress. Euthanasia is distinct from animal slaughter and pest control although in some cases the procedure is the same. In pet animals, this process is commonly referred to by euphemisms such as "put down" or "put to sleep". 
Ankylosing spondylitis ( AS ) is a type of arthritis . There is a long-term inflammation of the joints of the spine . [1] Usually the joints where the spine joins the pelvis are also affected. Eye and bowel problems may also occur. Pain in the back is a typical symptom of AS, and it often comes and goes. [1] Stiffness of the affected joints usually gets worse over time. [1] [2]  
Antacids (or indigestion tablets) are used to help stop indigestion . [1] People may get indigestion if they eat too much or if they have eaten too fast. With indigestion, the liquid in the stomach will become more acidic. Antacids will neutralise the acids. The reaction that is happening is called neutralisation . This is because the tablets are alkaline and the liquids in the stomach are acidic. This reaction between the stomach acids and the antacid will make the acid change into harmless substances such as water or salt. An example of an antacid is milk of magnesia . Side effects from taking antacids are rare, but can include both constipation and diarrhea . [1] They are also high in sodium so people with a heart condition on a low salt diet should ask their doctor before taking them. [1] 
An anticoagulant is a chemical injected under the skin or directly into a vein that stops blood clots .   
An Antimony pill is a pill made from metallic antimony . It was a popular remedy in the nineteenth century, used to purge and revitalise the bowels. In use, it is swallowed and allowed to pass through the body, after which it is recovered for reuse. They called it the everlasting pill . [1]  
An Antiplatelet drug is a drug that acts against blood clotting. The blood contains platelets , which will stick together, and close an open wound. In some cases, they also stick together in the bloodstream, and form blood clots . Such blood clots cause Strokes and Heart attacks . Another type of drug that prevents clotting is called anticoagulant . Anticoagulants cannot be used to prevent blood clotting in the arteries . Antiplatelet drugs are commonly used in the prevention of strokes and heart attacks. Acetylsalicylic acid , commonly known as Aspirin, is one of them. 
Antipsychotic drugs or Neuroleptics are drugs that act on the central nervous system , and that usually have sedating properties. The name neuroleptic was introduced in 1955, from the 1990s, the term antipsychotic is used more frequently. Neuroleptics make the patient calm. Today, they are mostly used for the treatment of psychosis , as it occurs in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder . They can also be used to treat depression and mood swings. Very strong antipsychotics can be combined with an opioid to produce a special analgesic ; the patient will be conscious, but heavily sedated , and feel very little pain . The main inventor of this drug was Andrew J. Smith whom at the time was 16 when he made it. He created this drug that has saved hundreds of people with schizophrenia. 
An antiseptic is a substance that is applied to lesions or wounds of the skin to kill germs . This helps prevent the wound becoming infected . Commonly used antiseptics include alcohol , iodine and mercury compounds . Antiseptics are different from antibiotics . Antiseptics can only be used on the skin, antibiotics can also be used internally, through the blood and lymphatic systems . They are also different from disinfectants : Disinfectants are used on non-living objects only, because they are dangerous to the living.  
An antivenom is a medicine used to protect against a specific venom. (A venom is a poison released by a snake or insect.) Frequently the venom of some creature such as a cobra will be harvested and a little will be injected using a hypodermic needle into a horse every day for a long time. The horse's body will develop an immunity to the venom, so more and more venom from the snake can be injected every day. After the horse is immune, its blood can be drawn little by little to get the part of the blood that makes the horse immune. That part can then be injected into humans who have been bitten by cobras. There are antivenoms for the very large and very dangerous funnel-web spiders found in Australia, and for the widow spiders (such as the black widow) found all around the world. 
Anxiolytics are drugs that are used for the treatment of anxiety , and anxiety-related disorders . [1] The common drugs can be classified: In addition to these drug classes, there are also certain plants that have such properties. Many of the drugs listed above have side-effects . For this reason, they are only available on prescription . Certain forms of therapy have also been used to treat anxiety disorders. Anxiolytics are said to act on key biochemical messengers in the brain and eventually decrease the abnormal excitability. The biochemical messengers or binding sites are unevenly distributed in the brain, and also said to be associated with a GABA receptor and a chloride channel. [2] [3] 
An appendectomy or appendicectomy is when a doctor removes the vermiform appendix . This is commonly done as a treatment for appendicitis . 
Argon plasma coagulation (APC) is the medical procedure to stop bleeding from an active bleeding site of the gastrointestinal tract. It is done with the help of endoscopy technique.  
Aripiprazole (also called Abilify ) is an antipsychotic medicine used for treatment of schizophrenia , bipolar disorder , autism and an adjuvant for major depression , which was first approved by Food and Drug Administration of the United States in November 2002. The first approval was for the treatment of schizophrenia . Later approvals were for bipolar disorder and depression. Common side effects include increase of blood sugar , vomiting , nausea and dizziness. 
Arteriovenous malformation is a rare disorder . It affects the areas between arteries and veins , and bypasses the capillary system. This happens in the central nervous system (usually cerebral AVM ), but may appear in any location. The disease can cause intense pain or bleeding or lead to other serious medical problems such as cerebral hemorrhages or strokes . AVMs are usually congenital . The genetic patterns of AVMs are incomplete, but there are known genetic mutations . [1] The general symptoms of a cerebral AVM include headaches and epileptic seizures . More specific symptoms occurring that normally depend on the place of the malformation.  
A pacemaker is a device created by Earl Bakken that helps to regulate your heart . It uses electrical pulses. If your heart is beating too fast, the pacemaker slows it down. If your heart slows down, the pacemaker will slightly speed it up, so that it goes back to a normal heart beat.  
Bacteria are used to test the effectiveness of disinfectants and antibiotics . Therefore, it is important that bacteria are not contaminated with other microorganisms . To prevent contamination, aseptic techniques are used. These include:  
Assisted suicide is when somebody who wants to commit suicide ( wants to die ) is helped to do this by someone else.  Normally, people who ask for assisted suicide are very ill and in a lot of pain, so they want someone to help them to die, for example by being given access to drugs which will kill them. Some people prefer the terms aid in dying or death with dignity to describe assisted suicide. The term euthanasia is sometimes used, although euthanasia is generally regarded as different to assisted suicide, as it involves causing a person to die rather than helping them to kill themselves. The law about this varies a lot in different countries.  In Belgium , the Netherlands , Switzerland and in three American states it is legal to help someone to die in these circumstances.  However, in many countries it is not allowed, and the person who helps someone to die may be arrested and sent to prison . Some people who are very ill and want to die may go to these countries, such as Switzerland, in order to end their life.

Autotransplantation is transplanting tissues from one part of the body to another part of the same person. Skin grafts are a common example. Another example: a piece of bone (usually from the hip) is removed and ground into a paste when reconstructing another portion of bone.  
Ayurveda ( / ˌ ɑː j ʊər ˈ v eɪ d ə , - ˈ v iː -/ ) [1] is an alternative medicine system from the Indian subcontinent . [2] Ayurveda is [scientific]. [3] [4] [5] The Indian Medical Association (IMA) says the practice of modern medicine by Ayurveda is quackery . [6] Ayurvedic texts say that the gods of Hindu mythology gave medical knowledge to legendary Hindu philosophers , who then gave the knowledge to human physicians . [7] The word "ayurveda" is from the Sanskrit : आयुर्वेद , Āyurveda , and means knowledge of life and longevity . [8] In Ayurveda, the story is that Dhanvantari , the Hindu god of Ayurveda, made himself into a human king by incarnation . He was king of Varanasi , and taught Ayurvedic medicine to a group of physicians. One of these physicians, named Sushruta, wrote the Sushruta Samhita ( Sushruta's Compendium ), an Ayurvedic text that has this story in it. [9] [10] Most Ayurvedic therapies are made from chemical compounds taken from plants, from minerals , and from metals . In ancient India , Ayurvedic texts gave explanations for surgeries and for the stitching of wounds to help wound healing . The ancient Indians knew how to take out kidney stones and how to do rhinoplasty ( plastic surgery for the nose). [11] [12] People have used many different Ayurvedic therapies through the history of India . Ayurveda has changed for more than two thousand years. [2] In the 1970s and 1980s, Ayurveda also changed for consumption in the Western world . Some people say Ayurveda comes from Prehistory . [13] [14] Some ideas in Ayurveda may have been in existence at the time of the Indus Valley civilization , during the Bronze Age in India. [15] During the Vedic period , Ayurveda went through many developments. Outside the tradition of the Vedas , Buddhism and Jainism also shared some ideas with the Ayurvedic texts from ancient India. [15] By around two thousand years ago, Ayurveda had developed some of its ideas for surgery and drugs . [16] There is no good evidence that works or helps for any disease . [17] Some Ayurvedic products have lead , mercury , and arsenic in them. [18] In 2008, nearly 21% of Ayurvedic products sold on the internet and made in India and the United States had in them lead , mercury , and arsenic ( heavy metals ) in quantities that are toxic . [19] There may be public health dangers that result from this, but that is not known. [19] 
Azathioprine is an immunosuppressant drug . It is used in, for example, the organ transplantation of kidneys .  
Bacillus Calmette–Guerin is a vaccine against tuberculosis . It is often abbreviated BCG . The vaccine is based on a bovine strain of the bacterium . It was developed by Albert Calmette and Camille Guerin in the 1930s. It looks like the vaccine can also be used to treat certain forms of bladder cancer . [1]  
A bandage is strip of cloth or other material that is used to stop and absorb blood from wounds . In common speech, the word "bandage" is often used to mean a dressing , though technically the two are different things. See these links:  
Barbiturates are a group of drugs that are derivates of Barbituric acid . Adolf von Baeyer was the first to produce Barbituric acid, in 1863. For many years, barbiturates were used as sedatives . Today, their use is very limited in many countries, mainly because they cause addiction and people soon develop a tolerance . People with a drug tolerance will need a higher dosage of the drug to get the same effect as before. [1] After a while, the drug becomes useless for such people. Barbiturates were once used as a primary treatment for Epilepsy ; this is especially true for the substance called Phenobarbitol or Phenobarbitone .  The sedative side effect of the drug made it increasingly unpopular, and it is now prescribed less for epilepsy, in favor of other drugs that do not have sedative effects. Benzodiazepines are another group of drugs, which have sedative properties: They make people sleepy, and help them sleep. In contrast, Barbiturates force people to sleep. In the case of severe sleeping problems which cannot be controlled by other drugs, Barbiturates are sometimes used as off-label drugs . 
A bat-borne virus is a virus that is transmitted through bats . Bats are vectors for these viruses, they  transmit them either through their saliva , or through their feces . Known examples of bat-borne viruses are the coronaviruses (such as those causing SARS and MERS ), the Ebola virus , and some forms of rabies . Many bats live in groups, which remain close to each other for a long time. It is believed that this habit helps the spread of infections . Because of their ability to fly, bats also spread the viruses in a larger area than rodents do.  
Benadryl is a brand name for a number of different medications to relieve allergies and coughs . It usually contains antihistamine diphenhydramine . In the United Kingdom, it contains either the antihistamine acrivastine or the long-acting antihistamine cetirizine . Benadryl products are sold in Australia and New Zealand as a cough medicine and do not contain any antihistamine. [1] [2]  
The word benign is often used to refer to a medical condition that will not become life-threatening if it is not treated , but can also mean that something is not harmful .  It is often used in relation to tumours that do not metastasise to other parts of the body .  Tumours that are referred to as being benign may still be life-threatening because of other reasons.  Because of this, the term applies mainly to their biological behaviour. Tumors that are benign may be at risk of changing into malignancy .  These are termed " premalignant ". 
Beta blockers is the name for a class of drugs that inhibit the hormone adrenalin and the neurotransmitter noradrenalin . Adrenalin is mainly released in stress situations; blocking its pathway will lead to lowering the heart rate, and blood pressure .  
Bevacizumab is an anti-angiogenic drug that is used in the treatment of Metastatic Renal cell carcinoma , Metastatic breast cancer , Non-small cell lung cancer , and is also approved in the treatment Glioblastoma multiforme . [1] 
Bibliomania can be a symptom of obsessive-compulsive disorder , by collecting of books to the point where social relations or health are in danger. It can be connected to stealing ( kleptomania ) of books. Bibliomania is not to be confused with bibliophilia , which is the usual love of books. Don Quixote may be the most famous bibliomaniac in fiction . 
Binge eating [1] is a disease characterized by episodes of compulsive overeating. It has the following characteristics: The vicious cycle of binge eating It can make people feel satisfied for a while, but after that, they will feel guilty and they will regret eating so much. People overeat to feel better, but they actually feel worse, and go back to overeating for relief, forming a vicious cycle. Other characteristics: If binge eating becomes a pattern, this is an eating disorder . People who suffer from this have a high risk of weight gain . They may feel ashamed of their eating habits and become depressed . People who binge and then purge , (usually by vomiting ), have a different eating disorder called bulimia . People with anorexia may also binge and purge. 
A biopsy is a test in medicine where doctors remove cells and look at them closely under a microscope or do chemical analysis to see whether there is an illness . Biopsy is a Greek word, from the Greek words bio meaning "life" and opsia meaning see.  
Biricodar is dicitrate salt called Incel . It is a pharmaceutical drug made by Vertex Pharmaceuticals in 1999 to help treat ovarian cancer patients.  
A birth defect (or congenital disorder ) is a defect in a baby at birth, or which develop in the first month of life. [2] It is neutral as to whether the cause is genetic (inherited birth defect) or environmental (causes in the environment, that is, outside the foetus ). If a condition is said to be "congenital", that is neutral language. Often it is not known what causes a condition found at birth. In common use, it is often redirected to "birth defect". That term is also neutral as to cause. There are two main types of congenital defect. The first is caused by genetic abnormalities , which are hereditary . The second may be caused by conditions (such as infectious diseases ) which a baby may get. [3] However, we may not know what caused the condition. Sometimes doctors may find out that a baby has a congenital disorder before its birth. They use prenatal diagnosis and screening tests, such as amniocentesis . [4] Some gene alleles (versions of a gene) can damage the baby. 
Blood donation is when a person voluntarily gives blood, which can be used for blood transfusions or to make certain drugs . Blood banks store this blood. The blood can be used to help the victims of accidents , for example. Usually, the blood donor and the donated blood are tested for diseases which spread through the blood. These include various forms of Hepatitis , HIV and Syphilis . Usually a series of questions also need to be answered to make sure that there is no risk to the person donating. A special case of blood donation sometimes occurs before a medical operation that is dangerous. People donate their own blood, which can be used after the operation if they lose too much blood. 
Blood doping is a way of increasing the number of red blood cells in the bloodstream. This is done to improve athletic performance. Because blood cells carry oxygen from the lungs to the muscles , a having more red cells in the blood can improve an athlete’s aerobic capacity (VO 2 max) and endurance . [1] Many methods of blood doping are illegal, particularly in professional sport. There are a number of different methods. Frozen blood taken from the individual previously can be used for a later transplant; packed red cells from a compatible donor may be used, and blood substitutes may be used. The growth area in illegal blood doping of athletes is blood substitutes.    
Blood draw is when blood gets taken from a vein using a hypodermic needle . It is stored in special blood bottles. These bottles are called vacutainers . There is usually a liquid or mist in the bottle that moves blood inside it. 
A blood film or peripheral blood smear is a thin layer of blood smeared on a microscope slide and then stained in such a way to allow the various blood cells to be examined microscopically. Blood films are usually examined to investigate disorders of the blood and, occasionally, to look for parasites within the blood such as malaria and filaria. [1]  
A blood test , also known as bloodwork , is a laboratory analysis performed on a blood sample. The sample  is usually taken from a vein in the arm using a needle , or via fingerprick .  Blood tests [1] are used to determine physiological and biochemical states, such as disease , mineral content, drug effectiveness, and organ function. They are also used to test for certain drugs . 
Blood transfusion is a medical term. It means a procedure used to transfer blood (or some products based on blood) from the circulatory system of one human to that of another human. Blood transfusions can save the life of a person, if that person has lost a lot of blood. A person can lose blood from an injury , a trauma or from a medical operation. Blood transfusions can also be applied as a treatment to certain diseases of the blood (like Anaemia , for example). Blood is not collected and used immediately.  Instead it is kept until it is needed.  The storage area is informally called a blood bank . By adding anti-coagulant to keep the blood from clotting and refrigerating the blood, it is possible to store it for a few days.  Information about transfusion and donation is available at the National Institutes of Health website [1] . Not all people are able to donate blood to all other people. Testing for blood types usually prevents any bad reaction to a blood transfusion. However, there are special problems for anyone with rare blood groups. It is very important, in order to avoid any complications during a blood transfusion, to detect individuals with rare blood types. The usual tests for ABO blood group system would show them as group O. It may not be possible to give a blood transfusion at all unless the repository has supply of blood which will not cause a reaction.it donates blood  
Bloodletting is the practice  of withdrawing blood from a patient to cure a disease . The practice was widely used in Antiquity and the Middle Ages . People stopped using it in the 19th century . The idea of bloodletting comes from an ancient system of medicine called Humorism : This system states, that there are different humors in the body. To remain healthy, a patient had to keep these humours in balance. Bloodletting was the most common medical practice performed by physicians from antiquity until the late 19th century, a span of almost 2,000 years. [1] It was found that only in very few cases, this treatment helps cure a disease. The practice has now been abandoned for all except a few very specific conditions . [2] There was no other treatment for hypertension . Bloodletting could sometimes have had a beneficial effect in temporarily reducing blood pressure by reducing blood volume. [3] The problem with hypertension is that it is difficult to diagonse from its symptoms . Modern methods directly measure blood pressure. In Antiquity, this  effect was therefore unintentional. In most cases, the historical use of bloodletting was harmful to patients. [4] The diseases where bloodletting actually helps include Polycythemia vera . In this disease, the number of red blood cells is increased, which changes the viscosity of the blood. Another disease is Polycythemia , which also leads to an increased number of red blood cells.  
Bone marrow failure happens when people who produce a low amount of red blood cells , white blood cells or platelets . Red blood cells transport oxygen to be spread throughout the body’s tissue. White blood cells fight off infections that enter the body. Bone marrow also has platelets , which trigger clotting , and thus help stop the blood flow when a wound occurs. [1] 
Bone metastases are when a cancer spreads to the bones . This is called metastasis . People with breast and prostate cancer have more bone metastases than other cancers. However, almost any other cancer can spread to the bone. Symptoms of bone metastases include:  
Bowel obstruction , also known as intestinal obstruction , is a mechanical or functional obstruction of the intestines which prevents the normal movement of the products of digestion . [1] [2] Either the small bowel or large bowel may be affected. [3] Signs and symptoms include abdominal pain , vomiting , bloating and not passing gas .  
Breast augmentation is a surgical procedure used to increase the size of the breasts . Usually, implants are used, but another technique called fat grafting is sometimes used. The size increase can be as small as one cup size, or as large as 10 cup sizes or more. The larger the increase, the greater the risk of complications . Complications may include leaking of the implants, which may require the implants to be replaced. With larger breasts the whole weight balance of the body is changed, which may cause stress to the muscular and skeletal systems. A surgical implant is either an implant filled with saline -solution, or an implant filled with silicone -gel. The fat-graft transfer uses grafts of adipose fat tissue from the woman’s own body. A full assessment of this method is not yet available. The method does not allow for the huge size increase possible with implants, and slim women may not have enough fat tissue to allow the method to be used.  
Breast reduction is a plastic surgery to make human breasts smaller. The doctor takes out fat , skin , and glands . It is done on women most of the time, but men can also get it. In 2005 , more than 113,000 women had breast reductions. [1] [2] Aside from aesthetic reasons, many women choose to undergo breast reduction surgery to help reduce back strain, skin irritation, or breathing problems caused by large breasts.  
The Bristol stool scale is a medical diagnosis tool used by Doctors to classify the way feces looks into 7 different categories . [1] It is also known by the names, Bristol stool chart and Bristol stool form scale . It was developed at Bristol Royal Infirmary in 1997 as a clinical assessment tool, but is also used to help with patients who can't speak, so that they can show their doctor if they have a problem with their bowels (a clinical communication aid ).  It's also used to help diagnose Irritable Bowel Syndrome . The seven types of feces described by the scale are:  
The British Medical Journal ( BMJ ) is a popular peer-reviewed general medical journal. It is published by the BMJ Publishing Group in London . There is an online version.  
Bupropion is an antidepressant .  It is also used to help people quit smoking . [1] It is marketed as Wellbutrin.  
In medicine , a bypass usually means making another route for the blood to flow.  Sometimes an artery , the channel through which the blood flows, becomes blocked up.  The patient has a bypass operation .  Very often the surgeon will take part of a vein from the patient's leg and move it to the place with the blockage so that the blood can flow round the blocked part. 
The Cancer Council Australia is a national, not-for-profit organisation which aims to promote cancer -control policies and to reduce the illness caused by cancer in Australia . It advises various groups, including the government, on cancer-related issues, acts as an advocate for cancer patients and their families, and is a major funding contributor towards cancer research . 
Cancer of unknown primary origin ( CUP , " occult cancer ") is a term used to describe a cancer that is said to be at the metastatic stage at the time of diagnosis, but a primary tumor cannot be identified. A diagnosis of CUP requires a clinical picture  with metastatic disease and one or more biopsy results inconsistent with a primary tumor. [1] CUP is found in about 3 to 5% of all people diagnosed with invasive cancer, [2] and carries a poor prognosis in most (80 to 85%) of those circumstances.  The other 15 to 20% of patients, however, have a relatively long survival with appropriate treatment. [2] 
Cannabis drug testing describes many drug testing methods for the use of cannabis in medicine, sport, and law. [1] Cannabis use is easy to detect using urine testing, hair analysis and breath. There are some ways to cheat such a test using synthetic urine or human hair - making blood testing the most effective. [2] Unlike alcohol, Cannabis testing is time consuming, expensive and cannot give accurate time of consuming and level of intoxication. [3] The lack of good testing methods and universal intoxication level scale is an issue in the legality of cannabis debate, especially regarding intoxicated driving . [4] 
Cardiology (from Greek καρδίᾱ , kardiā , "heart"; and -λογία , -logia ) is a medical field that deals with disorders of the heart and blood vessels . Physicians in this field are called cardiologists. Cardiologists are different from cardiac surgeons who do cardiac surgery . 
Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) is a kind of disease that involves the heart or blood vessels . [1] Cardiovascular disease includes coronary artery diseases (CAD) such as angina and myocardial infarction (commonly known as a heart attack). [1] Other CVDs are stroke , hypertensive heart disease , rheumatic heart disease , cardiomyopathy , atrial fibrillation , congenital heart disease , endocarditis , aortic aneurysms , and peripheral artery disease . [1]  
Cefalexin is a type of drug called an antibiotic . It is a type of antibiotic called a cephalosporin. [1] Cefalexin can treat some bacterial infections in areas including the ear , bone , joint , skin , and bladder .  It may also be used for some types of pneumonia and strep throat . Like other antibiotics, cefalexin cannot treat viral infections, such as the flu or common cold . [1] Cefalexin can be used in children and people over the age of 65. [1] Using it during pregnancy [2] or breastfeeding [3] has not been shown to cause harm to the baby. [1] People with kidney problems may need lower doses of cefalexin. [1] Common side effects include diarrhea , vomiting , and upset stomach . Allergic reactions can occur, such as rash or even trouble breathing . [1] An allergic reaction and infection with Clostridium difficile (C. diff) , a severe diarrhea, is also possible. [1] Cefalexin can interact with some drugs. [4] These interactions are usually mild. [5] BCG can treat cancer and also is a tuberculosis vaccine . [6] Cefalexin and BCG cannot be taken together because the effects of BCG will decrease. [7] Alcohol may affect the absorption of the drug. [8] This drug can be taken by mouth in the form of a tablet, capsule, or suspension. [4] It is taken with or without food. [4] 
Central nervous system diseases , also known as central nervous system disorders , are a group of neurological disorders that affect the structure or function of the brain or spinal cord . They form the central nervous system (CNS). [1] [2] [3] 
A central venous catheter ( CVC ) or " central line " is a catheter put in a large vein in the neck , chest , or groin when a patient needs close cardiovascular monitoring, for assessment of fluid status, and so that intravenous drugs and fluids can be given to the patient more effectively.  The veins most commonly used are the internal jugular vein , the subclavian vein , and the femoral vein .  
The Centre hospitalier intercommunal de Poissy-Saint-Germain-en-Laye is a well-known hospital in the Poissy and Saint-Germain-en-Laye , close to Paris . It has been created in 1997. [1] He is partner of the Université de Versailles Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines . [2]    
Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), also known as congophilic angiopathy , [1] is a form of angiopathy in which amyloid comes out of the walls of the blood vessels of the central nervous system. [2] The term congophilic is used because the amyloid appears red when looked under a microscope when Congo red dye is used. The amyloid material is only found in the brain and as such the disease is not related to other forms of amyloidosis . [3] 
A cerebral arteriovenous malformation ( cerebral AVM , CAVM , cAVM ) is a rare connection between the arteries and veins in the brain . It is an arteriovenous malformation in the cerebrum . In serious cases, the blood vessels rupture and there is bleeding within the brain ( intracranial hemorrhage ). Nevertheless, in more than half of patients with AVM, hemorrhage is the first symptom. [1] The most problems related to an AVM, are headaches and seizures , cranial nerve deficits, [2] backaches, neckaches and eventual nausea.  
A cerebral infarction is an area of necrotic tissue in the brain caused from a blockage or narrowing in the arteries supplying blood and oxygen to the brain. The lack of oxygen due to the low blood supply causes an ischemic stroke that can result in an infarction if the blood flow is not restored within a relatively short period of time. The blockage can be due to a thrombus , an embolus or an atheromatous stenosis of one or more arteries . [1] Which arteries are problematic will determine which areas of the brain are affected (infarcted). These varying infarcts will produce different symptoms and outcomes. About one third will prove fatal.  
Cerebrovascular disease , stroke or cerebrovascular accident, [1] is a vascular disease of the cerebral circulation . Arteries supplying oxygen to the brain are affected resulting in one of a number of cerebrovascular diseases. Most commonly this is a stroke or mini-stroke and sometimes can be a hemorrhagic stroke . Any of these can result in vascular dementia . [2] Causes of cerebrovascular disease can be divided into: atherosclerosis , embolism , aneurysms , low flow states, and other rare causes. [3] Major modifiable risk factors include: [4] Treatment for cerebrovascular disease includes medication , lifestyle changes and surgery . [5] Examples of medications are: Surgical procedures include: 
A Cesarean section (often called a C-section ) [1] is a kind of surgery , which is usually done to make childbirth easier. In the past, this was done when there was a great risk to the health of the mother, or when normal childbirth through the vagina was not possible. More recently, it has also been done on request, without these reasons. In very rare cases, abortions are performed using this procedure, these are called Hysterotomy abortions . The first person to perform a modern Cesarean section was Ferdinand Adolf Kehrer , in 1881. In Latin , it is called Sectio caesarea , in English, the spelling Caesarean section also exists. The rate of babies delivered through Cesarean section varies: It is at a record level of 46% in China; levels of 25% and above are common in many Asian and European countries, Latin America, and the United States. [2] From about the 6th century, there  was Roman law that stated that a living foetus may not be buried with the mother, The Digest notes this to be a "lex regia". If this were the case, it would date from the time around 700 BC, when there were Roman kings. 
A chemical burn is an uncomfortable sensation caused by the destruction of body tissue. It is destroyed by various chemicals. For example, concentrated sulfuric acid makes very bad chemical burns. [1] Hydrochloric acid makes milder burns. [2] There are several ways to protect against chemical burns, such as wearing gloves and a lab apron when working with chemicals. Each chemical has its own way to remove it from the skin, but normally drenching the burn with water should help.   
Chiropractic is a form of alternative medicine . A chiropractor is a person who went to school to learn chiropractic. Chiropractors may diagnose and treat many conditions relating to muscles , joints , and nerves of the body . They may give what is called an "adjustment" to the body. An adjustment is a fast short push to an area of the patient 's spine or other joints to help their condition. Chiropractors do not use drugs to treat patients. They use natural treatments such as nutrition , exercise , physical therapy , adjustments, and massage in order to help their patients. Chiropractic has changed since it was created over 100 years ago because chiropractors learn new facts and do new research . Chiropractors have many different ways to treat their patients. They all use drug free treatments. Chiropractic is best known for helping people with spine pain , but chiropractors can also help other problems. There has been a debate as to whether or not chiropractic is classified as Pseudoscience .  
Chlorpromazine is an antipsychotic drug . It is the oldest such drug. It was developed in 1950. It is typically used to treat Schizophrenia . It has also been used to treat bipolar disorder . It has been shown to help uncontrollable hiccups disappear. It is also used to help with nausea and vomiting .  
The choking game is a challenge that aims to cause unconsciousness by lowering the supply of oxygen to the brain . When becoming conscious again ("waking up"), people often have a euphoric feeling , or a good dream. Most of the time, adolescents try this game. One of the reasons is that they want to experiment with other states of consciousness. If they do it as a group, peer pressure often plays a role. The practice seems to have started in France, in the early 20th century. After the second world war (late 1940s, to early 1950s), several authors described it. The reasons to play this game are different from those of erotic asphyxiation . Steve Field, chairman of the Royal College of General Practitioners in London, [1] claims that children and teens try the game mainly "to get a high without taking drugs." Children "aren't playing this game for sexual gratification."  It is frequently confused with erotic asphyxiation, which is oxygen deprivation for sexual arousal .  Unlike erotic asphyxiation, adults usually don't play this game. [2] [3] The brain will take permanent damage, if it doesn't get enough oxygen.  The first effects occur within minutes. In the United States , and in France , where it is known as "jeu de foulard", this practice has caused several deaths. The CDC has identified 82 victims aged between 6 and 19 years, who died as a result of this practice, between 1995 and 2007. [4] Most of the sensations felt are: 
Chordoma is a slow growing, very rare kind of cancerous tumor . 
Chorea (sometimes called Choreia ) is the name for a set of symptoms caused by some neurological conditions . The word "chorea" comes from Greek , where it means " dance ". People with chorea move without being able to control those movements. The movements seem to spread from one muscle to the next. Chorea is one of the main symptoms of Huntington's disease . Some forms of chorea are not linked to neurological conditions, though. Chorea can develop as a complication of pregnancy .  It can be a sign of hyperthyroidism . It can also be caused by drugs taken in the wrong dose. For example, L-Dopa (taken against Parkinson's disease ), certain forms of birth control , or certain antipsychotics can cause chorea if they are used in the wrong doses. 
In medicine a chronic disease or condition is one that takes a long time to heal (or go away), or one that comes again.  Many chronic diseases require special treatment, as this has to be done for a long time. A chronic disease can even last for a lifetime.  
Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy ( CIDP ) is an immune-mediated inflammatory disorder of the peripheral nervous system . The disorder is sometimes called chronic relapsing polyneuropathy (CRP) or chronic inflammatory demyelinating poly radiculo neuropathy (because it involves the nerve roots). CIDP is closely related to Guillain–Barré syndrome and it is thought to be the chronic counterpart of that acute disease. [1] Its symptoms are also similar to progressive inflammatory neuropathy . Several variants have been reported. Specially important are: 
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes too many lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell ). [1] [2] Early on there are typically no symptoms. [1] Later non-painful lymph node swelling, feeling tired, fever , night sweats , or weight loss for no clear reason may occur. [1] Risk factors include having a family history of the disease. 
Cirrhosis is a disease of the liver .  Normal liver tissue is replaced by scar tissue . The liver does not work so well. Cirrhosis is caused mostly by alcoholism , hepatitis B or hepatitis C . Ascites (retention of fluid in the abdomen ) is the most common complication for cirrhosis. The patient's skin develops a yellowish hue ( jaundice ) as the disease gets worse. Liver damage by cirrhosis cannot be repaired. It leads to a poor quality of life, and can cause death.  
Citalopram (better known as Celexa ) is an antidepressant used to treat major depression and off-label conditions. This medicine was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in the 1990s. Adverse affects from this medicine include although are not limited to drowsiness, nausea , vivid dreaming, dry mouth and trembling. Citalopram is also used for anxiety conditions and panic disorder . 
Clear-cell sarcoma is a rare form of cancer called sarcoma . [1] It is known to happen mainly in the soft tissues and dermis. Recurrence is common. [2] Clear cell sarcoma of the soft tissues in adults is not related to the pediatric tumor known as clear cell sarcoma of the kidney . [3] 
A clinical thermometer is a thermometer used to measure human body temperature . Most made in the 20th century are mercury-in-glass thermometer s. They are accurate and sensitive, having a narrow place where the mercury level rises very fast. A kink in the tube stops the mercury level from falling on it own. These thermometers are used in clinics by doctors,  it is a clinical thermometers they are also called a doctor's thermometers or medical thermometers.  Most show both Celsius scale and Fahrenheit temperature scales, and run from 35 degree Celsius to 42 degree Celsius. Medical thermometers are cleaned before and after each use, with alcohol . For centuries medical thermometers were large, and took many minutes to register a temperature.  In the 1860s smaller, better ones were made, and thus thermometers were more often used.  An ear thermometer was invented in the 1960s, which works quickly and easily.  Digital thermometers became widespread in the late 20th century. 
Clonazepam is an anticonvulsant . This means it can be used to stop seizures . It is also used to lessen states of fear . It is an anxiolytic . It is a benzodiazepine . Benzodiazepines are very addictive . Clonazepam is used to treat certain forms of epilepsy . It is also used to treat certain disorders of sleep, such as sleepwalking . In certain cases it is used as an off-label drug in psychiatry . It is also used for panic disorders . 
Clonus is the name for involuntary rhythmic contractions of muscles or muscle groups. The term is from the Greek for "violent, confused motion".  Cloni can happen as a sign of certain neurological conditions , such as epilepsy , stroke , and multiple sclerosis . They can also be a sign that the spinal cord was damaged. Cloni can also occur as a reaction to certain drugs . 
Clostridioides difficile infection ( CDI or C-diff ), also known as Clostridium difficile infection , is a symptomatic infection caused by the spore -forming bacterium Clostridioides difficile . [1] Symptoms include watery diarrhea , fever, nausea, and abdominal pain . It makes up about 20% of cases of antibiotic-associated diarrhea . Problems caused by this infection are pseudomembranous colitis , toxic megacolon , perforation of the colon , and sepsis . Clostridioides difficile infection is spread by bacterial spores found within feces . 
Colic is a form of pain that starts and stops quickly and out of nowhere. It happens because muscular contractions of a hollow tube (colon, gall bladder , ureter , etc.). This is done to remove an obstruction by forcing content out. It may cause sweating and vomiting . [1] 
Coma is a medical term. It is a state of deep unconsciousness . People who are in that state cannot be woken up. They also do not react to pain or light . Coma can result from various conditions . Some of these are intoxication , poisons , damages or diseases of the nervous system . It can also be the result of certain drugs . Doctors sometimes put patients that have very bad injuries into a coma. There are different levels of coma. Comas usually do not last more than several weeks, but those several weeks could be disastrous . Sometimes only basic bodily functions are left over. Intensive hospital care is often needed to recover some of these functions. Some comas can last years, but these are usually not woken up from. The family of a coma victim (or whoever has the power of Attorney ) can sign papers so that they are taken off of life support and then will die .  
In medicine the term comorbidity is used to describe diseases and conditions that often occur together with another disease or condition. The first disease or disorder is called primary . In many cases, the primary condition or disease does not cause the comorbid disorders. However, they may both be caused or partly caused by the same thing, for example a genetic mutation or a traumatic experience. As an example, a patient may have antisocial personality disorder and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder . The two conditions are comorbid . Another patient might suffer from borderline personality disorder , posttraumatic stress disorder and bipolar disorder . The three conditions are comorbid . 
In medicine , people talk about complications if a disease or condition a patient has gets worse. This makes it more difficult (or more complicated, that is where the word is from) to treat.  
Compulsory sterilization is a term used for laws that force certain groups of people to be sterilized so that they can no longer make babies . International Criminal Court considers compulsory sterilization for a " crime against humanity". Transgender persons are often obliged to undergo sterilization for legal rocognition of legal status depite the Principle 3 of the Yogyakarta Principles . Such laws were mainly introduced because of Eugenic views of the start of the 20th century . Today, most compulsory sterilizations are done to mentally ill people who are not able to handle a pregnancy on their own. [1] In China , compulsory sterilization is part of family planning .  
In the United Kingdom , certain drugs are classified as controlled drugs . Controlled drugs are illegal to possess, use, or supply to others without a license . These drugs are governed under the Misuse of Drugs Act of 1971. This act defines three categories of controlled drugs: A , B , and C . The penalties for illegaly possessing, using or supplying a controlled drug are different depending on which category the drug belongs to. Many of these drugs are also governed by other laws, such as the Medicines Act . Also, there are many other drugs that are not controlled by the Misuse of Drugs Act but that are controlled by other laws. Class A drugs are drugs that are considered the most dangerous. They carry the harshest punishments . Class C drugs are those that are thought to be much less dangerous. They therefore carry much less serious punishments. More serious punishments are dealt if the person is considered to have had the intention to supply the drug to others. Possession with intent to supply carries a maximum penalty of life in prison . The laws governing the use and supply of drugs for medical purposes are not part of the Misuse of Drugs Act. A different set of categories apply, which are defined in the Misuse of Drugs Regulations. This sets out five schedules, each with their own restrictions. These restrictions say that a person can possess and use certain drugs if they have the proper prescriptions for them. A prescriptions must be given by somebody who is licensed to provide it (e.g., a medical doctor ). The drug [1] itself must be supplied by somebody who is licensed to supply it (e.g., a pharmacy ).  
Coronary artery bypass surgery is a type of surgery that relieves chest pain , caused by lack of blood flow , and reduces the risk of death from heart disease . It is also known as coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG , pronounced "cabbage") surgery, and known by doctors as heart bypass or bypass surgery . In this surgery, blood vessels from elsewhere in the patient's body are added to the heart vessels to go around blood vessels blocked by fat and get more blood into the heart so it can keep running. This surgery usually happens with the heart stopped, which makes machines that act as lungs and heart needed. However, it is possible to have the surgery with the heart still pumping, called "off-pump" surgery.  
COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access , abbreviated as COVAX , is a global program that helps give COVID-19 vaccines to people living in poor countries led by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance ,  the World Health Organization (WHO), the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), and others. [1] By 15 July 2020, 165 countries – representing 60% of the human population – had joined COVAX. [2] 
Covonia is a brand of medicine for treating coughs and other chest infections . Covonia is owned by PL Holder and made by Thornton & Ross Ltd .  
Cow urine (गोमूत्र "Gomutra" in Hindi) is used as medicine mainly in India where cows are considered as holy by Hindus . [1] In addition cow urine is consumed as a drink by people believing it to boost the immunity. [2] Cow urine is one of the five contents of Panchagavya meaning five products obtained from a cow ( urine , milk , ghee , curd and dung ). Cow urine is also used in folk medicine in Myanmar , Nepal and Nigeria . [3] From ancient times it is used in Ayurveda medicine to treat leprosy , fever , peptic ulcers , liver diseases , kidney diseases , asthma , psoriasis , cancer and for weight loss in obesity . [4] [5] [6] Cow urine is used in organic farming as a fertilizer and to protect crops from fungal infections. [7] In addition cow urine is used as a floor cleaner and to manufacture cosmetic products like skin creams , bathing liquids and soap . [8] [9] [10]  
The cremaster muscle is a muscle that covers the testis and the spermatic cord . The word comes from the transitive Greek verb "I hang" ( Greek : κρεμάννυμι ). [1]  
Cryotherapy is using a freezing chamber (usually -110 degrees) to help muscles recover. Cyrotherapy is said to multiple applications. The word "Cryo" comes from Greek language, which means icy or cold. Cryotherapy is a procedure that exposes the body to temperatures colder than -200 degrees for about 3 minutes. [1] The practice is said to have originated in Japan in late 1970s when a Japanese rheumatologist used cold temperatures to treat his patients painful joints. [2] Cryotherapy is also used to treat cancer, wherein, extreme coldtemperatures destroy cancer cells. [3] 
The Curie Institute or Institut Curie is one of the leading medical research centres in the world.  It is a private non-profit foundation for research into cancer . It is located in Paris , France . [1] It was founded by Marie Curie and got state approval as a foundation in 1921. There are several hundred research staff at the Institute. Institut Curie does not offer undergrduate degrees, but does award Ph.D.s. Institut Curie runs the Hôpital Claudius Régaud , a cancer treatment hospital. Five Nobel prizes are attached to the Institute's researchers. 
Cyclophosphamide is a drug used in the treatment of lymphoma, some types of leukemia , and some solid cancers, as well as for some forms of Nephritis , Rheumatoid arthritis , and multiple sclerosis .  
Cyclothymia is a mental illness characterized by mood swings - a mood disorder . The disease is a milder version of bipolar disorder . The mood swings are usually less extreme. Mood swings can be spontaneous, or triggered by an event. Cyclothymia is also an old name for bipolar disorder. 
A cyst is a closed sac, having a distinct membrane and division compared with the nearby tissue . It is a cluster of cells that has grouped together to form a sac however an aspect of a cyst is that the cells forming the "shell" of such a sac are distinctly abnormal when compared with all surrounding cells for that given location. It may contain air, fluids, or semi-solid material. A collection of pus is called an abscess , not a cyst. Once formed, sometimes a cyst may resolve on its own. When a cyst fails to resolve, it may need to be removed surgically, but that would depend upon its type and location. 
Cysticercosis is a tissue infection caused by the young form of the pork tapeworm . [1] [2] People may have few or no symptoms for years. In some cases, particularly in Asia, solid lumps of between one and two centimetres may develop under the skin. [2] After months or years these lumps can become painful and swollen and then be cured. [3] 
Dacarbizine is a type of drug used to fight cancer .  It works by changing DNA , which makes cancer cells grow more slowly or completely stop growing. [1] It is used against metastatic melanoma . [1] Only about 15.3% of people who use the drug respond to it. [1] People who use this drug do not live any longer as a result. [1] It has side effects , including less blood cells , damage to the liver .  I can also sometimes make other types of cancer start growing. [1] 
A date rape drug is a drug that is used to make a person unable to consent to sex . This makes that person likely to be a victim of rape or sexual assault . [1] Date rape drugs include GHB , Rohypnol , alcohol and MDMA . Another is methaqualone, also known as Quaalude.  
Death by natural causes is often recorded on death records as the cause of a person's death . Death from natural causes might be a heart attack , stroke , cancer, infection, or any other illness . By contrast, death caused by active intervention is known as unnatural death . The "unnatural" causes are usually given as accident (implying no unreasonable voluntary risk), misadventure (accident following a willful and dangerous risk, which can include drug or alcohol overdose), suicide, or homicide . [1] In some settings, other categories may be added.  For example, a prison may track the deaths of inmates caused by acute intoxication separately. [2] Additionally, a cause of death can be recorded as "undetermined". [3] 
A decongestant (or nasal decongestant ) is a type of pharmaceutical drug that is used to help stop nasal congestion in the upper respiratory tract . The active ingredients that most decongestants have are pseudoephedrine or phenylephrine .  
Defibrillation is the act of defibrillating the heart to treat the heart when it is not pushing blood because the heart muscle is not working in any pattern. Electricity causes a muscle to contract, this is how nerves cause muscles to work. The heart is a large muscle, and certain parts need to contract before other parts in order to push blood through the heart and out to the rest of body correctly. Sometimes the heart muscle doesn't contract in the correct way or at the correct speed, this is called an arrhythmia (out of rhythm). Fibrillation is a type of arrhythmia when the whole heart is quivering, not organized to make heart beats of any kind. [1] CPR ( Cardiopulmonary resuscitation ) can get blood to the body when the heart is fibrillating, but the heart still needs to be restarted. Sometimes CPR will do that as well, but often a defibrillator is needed. Defibrillation is done with a defibrillator. Defibrillation works by carefully sending a strong electric current to the heart, which resets the heart, and hopefully returns a normal, coordinated heart rhythm. It needs to depolarise (take away the existing electric charge) from a large part of the heart muscle, which stops the arrhythmia and allows the normal heartbeat to return. Defibrillators can work outside the body with the use of an external defibrillator or an automated external defibrillator , or inside the body with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator . The first use of the technique on a human was in 1947 by Claude Beck, a professor of surgery at Case Western Reserve University. The patient was a 14-year-old boy named Mickey. [2] Defibrillation is now used during open heart surgery, when the heart is stopped on purpose. In1980 the first implanted defibrillator was put into a patient. Implanted defibrillators are put into the chests of people at risk of going into fibrillation. [3] Not all arrhythmias need defibrillation. Some arrhythmias still push blood to the body, not well, but still enough to keep a person alive. Other types, like ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia , will cause a person to die within minutes unless treated. These are what need to be treated by defibrillation. 
Degenerative disease is the result of a continuous process based on degenerative cell changes, affecting tissues or organs , which will increasingly deteriorate over time. [1] In neurodegenerative diseases cells of the central nervous system stop working or die via neurodegeneration . An example of this is Alzheimer's disease . [2] 
A delusion is a false belief held by a person. If doctors talk about delusions they mean that the false belief is the result of some disease , usually a disease of the mind , such as paranoia , schizophrenia or bipolar disorder , but not always neccesarily,  delusions can come in many different forms such as political differences, economic differences such as a god complex upheld by someone who believes they are all powerful and many other types. Delusions also have other properties, according to Karl Jaspers : [1] Studies on psychiatric patients show that delusions vary in intensity and conviction over time, which suggests that certainty and incorrigibility are not necessary components of a delusional belief. [2] Delusions do not necessarily have to be false or 'incorrect inferences about external reality'. [3] Some religious or spiritual beliefs by their nature may not be falsifiable, and hence cannot be described as false or incorrect, no matter whether the person holding these beliefs was diagnosed as delusional or not. [4] A doctor or psychiatrist may say that a delusion is false, because it seems to be unlikely or bizarre.Psychiatrists rarely have the time or resources to check the validity of a person’s claims; this means that some true beliefs are erroneously classified as delusional. [5] This is known as the Martha Mitchell effect , after the wife of the attorney general who alleged that illegal activity was taking place in the White House . At the time her claims were thought to be signs of mental illness. Only after the Watergate scandal was she proved right, and sane. 
Dental braces are wires that are held together by brackets glued to the permanent teeth . The wires and brackets may be made of metal or other materials. Each week or month (or other time the orthodontist decides) the braces may be checked, cleaned, or changed into a tighter wire. Braces are an orthodontic device. They are to make the teeth straight, and to correct problems in a person's bite. There are many natural problems which occur to the way teeth fit together, but not everyone needs or will need braces. However, the use of braces is quite common, even when they are not medically necessary. Their cosmetic use for young females is more common in countries with first world economies . To overcome the visibility of traditional metal braces, there are now nearly transparent braces. Sometimes braces are possible behind the teeth, and so are not in view. [1]  
Dentistry is a specialty in medicine , which is practiced by a dentist. Dentists find out what's wrong, fix, and help prevent problems with teeth . A dentist has other people that help him with their job. Dental hygienists help people keep their teeth clean. A dental assistant helps the dentist when they are treating a patient. Dental surgeons will perform surgery to fix large or dangerous problems with people's teeth. There are also dentists called orthodontists , who can move people's teeth using braces . Dental surgeons and orthodontists are called specialists. [1]  
Dentures (also known as false teeth ) are meant to solve dental problems of humans . They should not be worn overnight. [1] Famous people who wore them for years include George Washington . [2] The history goes back as early as 7th century BC . [3]  
A dependent personality disorder (DPD) is a personality disorder that involves a psychological dependence on other people. This personality disorder is a long-term ( chronic ) condition in which people depend on others to meet their emotional and physical needs. Only a small percentage of people with dependent personality disorders are eventually able to manage on their own.  
Depressants are a group of drugs that depress or slow down the activity of certain areas of the brain .  Functionally, depressants counter the effects of stimulants , which increase brain activity. Drugs of the depressant type are widely used around the world, as prescription drugs.  They can help with the following: Among the big groups of depressants are: 
Derealization ( DR ) is a change in the way someone views the world so that it seems unreal. Derealization can also make someone feel as if their environment does not have emotion or depth. This is a symptom of other problems, such as sleeping disorders , schizophrenia , and other mental disorders . It can also be caused by drug intoxication . Similar to derealization is depersonalization , but the two are different. Depersonalization is a sense of unreality about oneself. Derealization is a sense of unreality of the outside world. Derealization often happens during a traumatic or tragic event.  
Dermatology is a branch of medicine that deals with skin , hair, sweat glands, etc. Dermatologists are doctors who diagnose and treat diseases and tumors of the skin, hair, and sweat glands.  
Detoxification is when any toxic thing is removed from the human body, for example alcohol or poison. [1] A healthy lifestyle along with regular exercise can help you to remove toxins from the body. [ source? ] 
Dextromethorphan ( DXM or DM ) is a drug . It is used to prevent coughs in many over-the-counter cold and cough medicines. Dextromethorphan can also be used for pain relief or for psychological conditions. It is sold in syrup , tablet , and lozenge forms, manufactured under several different brand names and generic labels. In its pure form, dextromethorphan is a white powder. If more is taken than directed, dextromethorphan acts as a dissociative hallucinogenic drug. Its mechanism of action (how it works) is as an NMDA receptor antagonist (blocks a chemical in the brain), producing  effects similar to those of the controlled substances ketamine and phencyclidine (PCP). [1]  
The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( DSM )  is a guide to grouping mental disorders . It is published by the American Psychiatric Association . It is used in the United States and around the world by doctors , researchers, health insurance companies, companies which make medicine, and others. There have been five revisions since it was first published in 1952. Each time, more mental disorders were added, although some have been removed and are no longer seen as mental disorders. An example of this is homosexuality. The manual was developed from systems for collecting census and psychiatric hospital statistics , and from a manual written by the US Army . A lot of changes were made to it in 1980. The last time it was greatly changed was the fourth edition ("' DSM-IV' "), published in 1994, but small changes to text were made in a 2000 version. The fifth edition ("DSM-5") was published May 2013. The DSM has been criticized for being too influenced by the drug industry. The International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems , ICD, has a section about mental and behavioral disorders which is different from the DSM. The ICD, not the DSM, is the system used by the United States government. [1] 
Dialectical behavior therapy ( DBT ) is a form of psychotherapy developed by Marsha M. Linehan , a psychology researcher at the University of Washington . Linehan originally developed DBT to help people with borderline personality disorder (BPD). [1] [2] DBT uses cognitive-behavioral techniques to get patients to control their emotions and test what reality is. It also tests the patient's tolerance for distress , and tries to get them to accept their situation and be aware of their feelings . [3] Linehan's ideas about how to be aware of your feelings come from Buddhist meditation . DBT may be the first therapy that has been shown to be effective in treating BPD. [4] [5] [6] It can also help patients with spectrum mood problems, including self-injury . [7] DBT may help victims of sexual abuse and people addicted to drugs . [8] [9] In the early 1990’s, Dr. Marsha Linehan developed an alternative therapy to treat her borderline personality disorder patients. Instead of having a one-way conversation with the patient, the therapist would engage him through the use of real world examples to elicit the desired responses. One by one, Linehan was able to teach her patients how to react differently in a variety of situations. This process removes the obstacles to treatment that had confused therapists treating suicidal patients. In a recent study, DBT has proven especially effective in reducing self-injurious behavior, suicide attempts and inpatient treatment days. DBT has also been used to treat alcohol addiction [10] and drug addiction. 
Diazepam is a benzodiazepine which has a relatively long half-life . It is mostly used to treat anxiety , certain  forms of epilepsy , muscle spasms (where the muscle moves on its own, causing pain), and sleeping problems . Like with other benzodiazepines, there is a risk of addiction if used for long periods of this. For this reason the drug is used to treat acute cases (2-4 weeks maximum) to avoid dependence. According to the World Health Organization diazepam is an essential drug . Diazepam is marketed under a number of names; its original trade name was Valium . It has been the most prescribed medicine in the United States many times. It is sometimes used recreationally to cause a calming effect.  
Diclofenac is a non-steroidal ant-inflammatory drug . [1] It can be used as an analgesic and antipyretic. It is often used to treat bruises and strain injuiries. [2] Research experiments conducted in 2013, showed that Diclofenac increased the risk of heart attacks and stroke. [3] 
A dietitian or dietician is an expert in food and nutrition . Dietitians help promote good health through proper eating. They often write custom diets for people. In a medical setting they can give food supplements for those people who cannot get what they need because of swallowing problems. Dietitians want to find, cook and serve tasty, attractive and healthy food to patients, their families and healthcare providers. [1] In many countries only people with specific degrees or certifications can call themselves dietitians.  The term nutritionist is widely used as it is not controlled like the title dietitian, but the word nutritionist can be used without having the qualifications of registered dietitians. A nutritionist is not a dietitian as he is not registered to a national board and does not have the same qualifications. [2] Dietitians are important in the medical multidisciplinary team because they are experts in nutrition and can give advice to doctors , nurses , and other health care workers. [3] Dietitians supervise the preparation and service of food, help in research, and teach people on how to eat well.  
Dilation and Curettage (D&C) is a type of surgery used to diagnose and treat problems with woman's uterus . During a D&C, a doctor will do these things: [1] A D&C can be used for many reasons.  For example: [1]  
A disability is a condition that a person has which limits them in some way. People with a disability or disabilities may need to use special equipment that can help them. This can include using a wheelchair , a cane or walking stick, hearing aids , a teletypewriter (TTY) and using specially designed software and hardware for the personal computer . People who use a wheelchair or cane/walking stick cannot walk up or down stairs in a building. They need to use ramps and elevators when going into and moving around in a building. Wide doorways and accessible toilets also make it easier for people with physical disabilities to use. Prejudice towards people with disabilities is common. This is sometimes called ' ableism ' or anapirism. People with such a prejudice are called an ablecentrists , handicapists, anapirophobes, able-bodyists, disablists or anapirists. [1] 
The Diseases Database is a database on a free website that gives information about the relationships between medical conditions, symptoms , and medications . The database is run by Medical Object Oriented Software Enterprises Ltd, a small company based in London , UK . The site's stated aim is "education, background reading and general interest" with an intended audience "physicians, other clinical healthcare workers and students of these professions". The editor of the site is stated as Malcolm H Duncan, a UK qualified medical doctor. [1] The Diseases Database is based around a collection of concepts related to human medicine. These concepts include diseases, drugs, symptoms, physical signs and abnormal laboratory results. These are referred to as 'items'. There are around 8,000 items within the database. [2]  
In medicine , distress is a situation when a person is unable to completely adapt to stress . As a result, the person shows a set of behaviours which are not adapted to the situation. Very often, the person is aware of the situation, and feels bad about not being able to fully adapt. People often find ways of dealing with distress, in both negative and positive ways. Examples of positive ways are listening to music, calming exercises, sports and similar healthy distractions. Negative ways can include but are not limited to use of drugs including alcohol, and expression of anger, which are likely to lead to complicated social interactions, thus causing increased distress. 
A diuretic is a chemical substance. This substance is either in a herb (such as dandelions), or it has been separated and made into a drug . Diuretics increase the amount of urine that is secreted from the body. Diuretics are used as a treatment for heart failure , liver cirrhosis , hypertension and certain problems with the kidneys . Diuretics are often abused by people suffering form bulimia nervosa as a way to lose weight. Well-known substances that have diuretic properties are tea , coffee and alcohol .  
 Doctors Without Borders or Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is a non profitable international medical humanitarian organization created by doctors and journalists in France in 1971. [1] MSF gives emergency aid to people affected by wars , epidemics , famine , natural disasters and man-made disasters, or areas where there is no health care available. It provides this help to all people, regardless of their race, religion or political beliefs. In 1999 Doctors Without Borders was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize . [2] On 7 October 2015, President Barack Obama , also Nobel Peace Prize winner and at that time commander in chief , issued an apology to Doctors Without Borders for Kunduz hospital airstrike .

In sport , doping is the use of a drug that athletes or competitors are not allowed to use. Certain drugs, such as steroids , are not allowed (or banned ) in professional sports. This is because they can help a competitor's performance, by making them stronger or faster. This gives them an unfair advantage over other competitors. The drugs may be legal, but competitors will not be allowed to use them. Many sports make competitors take a drug test to prove that they are not using any drugs.    
Dorlands Illustrated Medical Dictionary is a medical dictionary edited by William Alexander Newman Dorland, and first printed in 1890. The word Dorland's is now the brand name for a family of more than 20 medical books available in various media (including printed books, CD-ROMs , and online content). The main books are Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary (now in its 32nd edition) and Dorland's Pocket Medical Dictionary (now in its 28th edition). Dorland's Medical Dictionary was first published in 1890 as the American Illustrated Medical Dictionary , including 770 pages. The pocket edition, called the American Pocket Medical Dictionary , was first published in 1898, with just over 500 pages. After Dorland died in 1956, the dictionaries were retitled to include his name, which was how they had generally come to be known.  The illustrated dictionary has grown to 2208 pages for the 31st edition. 
Drug withdrawal is the group of symptoms that occur upon the fast discontinuation or decrease in intake of medications or recreational drugs . [1] In order to experience the symptoms of withdrawal, one must have first developed a form of drug addiction , which may occur as physical dependence , psychological dependence , or both. [2] Anger : Because many marijuana users smoke as a means of escaping from difficult emotions, they don’t know how to regulate those emotions naturally.  The anger during withdrawal can range from a steady, mild stream of rage to a sudden and volatile outburst.  These can stem from feelings of anxiety and a general lack of emotional control during the first few days of withdrawing, which results in swaying back and forth between anger and euphoria.  However, these unbalanced emotions often regulate themselves naturally within three months. Insomnia : One of the most commonly reported symptoms associated with marijuana withdrawal is insomnia. This can range from a handful of consecutive sleepless nights to occasional sleepless nights over the course of several months. Nightmares : Nightmares and other forms of vivid dreams are also common in the later stages of withdrawal. They typically start about a week after last use and last anywhere from a week to a month. [3] 
Duchenne muscular dystrophy ( DMD ) is a severe type of muscular dystrophy . The symptom of muscle weakness usually begins around the age of four in boys and worsens quickly. Most are unable to walk by the age of 12. Scoliosis is also common. The disorder is X-linked recessive . About two thirds of cases are inherited from a person's mother , while one third of cases are due to a new mutation . It is caused by a mutation in the gene for the protein dystrophin . Although there is no known cure, physical therapy , braces , and corrective surgery may help with some symptoms. [1] 
Dysautonomia or autonomic dysfunction is a condition in which the autonomic nervous system (ANS) does not work properly. This may affect the heart , bladder , intestines , sweat glands , pupils , and blood vessels. Dysautonomia has many causes and may not be neuropathic . [1] 
Dystonia is a neurological movement disorder syndrome in which it had repetitive muscle contractions result in twisting and repetitive movements or abnormal positions. [1] The movements may look like tremors . Dystonia is often intensified  or exacerbated by physical activity, and symptoms may progress into adjacent muscles. [2] 
Electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT ), also called electroshock , is a psychiatric treatment in which seizures are caused by electricity in unconscious patients to treat llness. The process is completed by placing electrodes on the sides of the patient's head (on either both or just one side) and sending a small electric current through the brain. This lasts for about half a second. The patient is also made unconscious before the treatment for safety reasons. The therapy without informed consent is medical abuse and Article 18 of the Yogyakarta Principles prohibit to "care" any sexual orientation and gender identity though any therapy including this.  
Electrology is an electrical process to remove human hair so that it does not grow back. An electrologist is sometimes called an electrolysist in the United Kingdom . The process of removing the hair is referred to as electrolysis. The electrolysist slides a thin metal probe into each hair follicle . This, if done the right way, does not hurt the skin. Electricity flows to the follicle through the probe. This causes damage to the areas that grow hair so that it does not grow back. 
Eli Lilly and Company is an American global medication company. Its headquarters are in Indianapolis , Indiana . The products of the company are sold in about 125 countries. The company was founded in 1876. It was named after Colonel Eli Lilly, a pharmaceutical chemist and American Civil War veteran. Eli Lilly's most important products before World War II included diabetic insulin . One of the brand names they used for the insulin was Iletin.  In 2002, Eli Lilly made more products for people with diabetes than any other company. Eli Lilly is the largest manufacturer and distributor of medications used for mental health issues. They make medications for bipolar disorder , clinical depression, generalized anxiety and others. One drug in this class is Amytal. It is used mainly to help with sleep and anxiety. 
An Elizabethan collar , also called a, e-collar , lampshade or cone of shame is a piece of equipment used in veterinary medicine . [1] They stop the animal from licking or biting its body and from scratching or touching its head with its feet. [2] The veterinarian places the collar around the neck of an injured animal so that it cannot bite or lick the injured part of its body.  For example, a dog with a cut on its skin might need medicine placed directly on the cut. The dog might try to lick the medicine and poison itself.  An animal that has had surgery might try to pull out its stitches .  An animal with a broken leg might bite into its cast and try to pull it off.  If it is wearing an Elizabethan collar, it cannot do this. Some pet owners say their pets find it difficult to eat, drink and play while wearing an Elizabethan collar. [2] Veterinarians sometimes try other collars, like those made out of cloth, collars that look like inner-tube-shaped cushions, and collars that act more like a neck brace , stopping the animal from moving its head. [3] Elizabethan collars are named after Elizabethan ruffs , stiff, starched collars that people wore in 1500s England. Today, most Elizabethan collars are made out of plastic .  In the 1800s, they could be made out of wood or leather. [2] 
The emergency department ( ED ) is a part of a hospital for treating people who have just come to the hospital, need to be treated quickly even without an appointment. These people may have been hurt, or they may have suddenly become very ill. Patients come to an emergency department with little warning. Many come in an ambulance . Emergency departments often have staff working all day and all night, on every day of the week. This is because patients can arrive at any time. To work in those places, doctors and nurses must be trained in emergency medicine . There are many different names for an emergency department. They are often called an emergency room ( ER ), even if they are bigger than one room. They may also be called an emergency ward ( EW ) or emergency unit . In the United Kingdom and Ireland, they are usually called accident & emergency department ( A&E ) and less often as a casualty department . A 2005 patient study found an average emergency room wait time from 2 hours in Iowa to more than 5 hours in Arizona . [1] The Midwest had the highest number of emergency room visits (460 per 1,000 people). The West had the lowest number. [2] 
An emergency medical dispatcher is a person who answers telephone calls to the emergency medical services and sends out the ambulances . For each call they much decide if an ambulance is needed and which one should be sent. They also help the caller with their problems until the ambulance arrives. 
An emergency medical technician ( EMT ) is someone who works on an ambulance and takes care of sick and hurt people. EMTs used to be called "ambulance drivers," since much of their work is bringing people to an emergency room . Their other main duty is first aid including: [1] In the United States, each state decides what their EMTs can do. EMTs in every state are allowed to perform first aid. Each state has different rules for exactly what their EMTs can do. These rules are called treatment protocols . For example:  
An epidemic is a disease that spreads over a large area and affects many people at the same time. Epidemics are when a disease spreads from person to person faster than doctors can control. If the disease spreads over the whole world , sometimes it is called a pandemic . Such diseases must be treated quickly and properly otherwise they can infect people on large scale and pose a danger to the world. It is very important that timely vaccination and treatment is provided. The study of epidemics is part of epidemiology . 
Eradication is the lowering of an infectious disease 's existence in the global host population to zero. [1] It is sometimes confused with elimination, which describes either the reduction of an infectious disease's prevalence in a regional population to zero. 
Erotomania is a delusional disorder in which the subject has a delusion that a particular person is deeply in love with them; lack of response is rationalized, and pursuit and harassment may occur. 
Escitalopram is an antidepressant medication . It is used as a drug to help treat depression , obsessive-compulsive disorder , social anxiety disorder and other mental illnesses . It is commonly known and sold as Lexapro or Cipralex . [1] Escitalopram can cause sleeping problems, dry mouth and diarrhea . It can also cause sexual problems. [2] These sexual problems usually disappear after a person stops using the drug. However, in some cases these problems can last for months or years.  
Excessive daytime sleepiness (or EDS ) is a medical condition where people often feel sleepy during the day, even though they had enough sleep at night. EDS occurs with many sleep disorders . It is a defining feature of some sleep disorders such as narcolepsy , sleep apnea or Circadian rhythm sleep disorder . EDS is difficult to treat without knowing its causse. There are certain drugs that can help with EDS. In general, many treatments of the underlying disease (which causes the sleepiness) will also take into account EDS. The drugs which can treat EDS are usually stimulants .  
Extrapyramidal syndrome is when involuntary muscle movements occur in the face and neck. This may include lip smacking, tongue movements, blinking, and head or finger spasms . The patient may have difficulty moving his arms and legs, and slur their words. It occurs when dopamine is not correctly regulated by the body. It is usually a reaction to medicines , but is also caused by Parkinson's disease or a head injury .  
An eye drop is a type of treatment and medicine for the eye . It is used to stop someones eye from hurting. It may also be used to cure eye infections . [1] Eye drops are safe for children most of the time. [2] However, using eye drops for too much time can make the eyes turn red or hurt the child. [3] [4] Some eye drops are made for children. [5] 
Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing ( EMDR / AIP ) is considered by many therapists as a major form of psychotherapy . Francine Shapiro, Ph.D., noted that recalling or thinking about disturbing events, coupled with eye-motion; audio input or sensory input (touch, smell, taste) could aid unprocessed emotional trauma that are emotionally hurtful or painful to the body. The once painful emotional materials are un-embedded via recall of the event coupled with a sensory input which are 'metabolized' by the person's psyche from a painful and harmful state into a helpful learning experience. This processing has proven useful in helping overcome many traumatic events ranging from rape, family violence, physical or verbal abuse, first-responder shock, chronic pain, combat, hurtful memories; select health issues and unresolved, hurtful life experiences. EMDR involves the processing of painful emotional events via the recalling of the event...paired with movement of the eyes; the hearing of select sound; tactile contact; gustatory (taste) input as an input into the brains processing. This process helps the client to move-on from the physical or emotional pain they are feeling. EMDR or Adaptive Information Processing (AIP) as it is alternatively named, has been being tested and researched in a large number of organizations since it was first discovered in 1987. Like all psychological theorems and processes it has it's admiring adherents and strong critics. The EMDR has training and trainers licensed internationally and over 10,000 psychologists and therapists qualified to practice in the U.S. TREATMENT DESCRIPTION 
A risk factor in medicine is something that causes, or helps to cause, a medical condition.  For example, smoking or breathing in somebody else's tobacco smoke (called second-hand smoke) is a risk factor for emphysema and lung cancer . A trigger factor causes the symptoms of a medical condition to begin in a person who already has that medical condition. Example: Smoking or breathing in someone else's smoke can be a trigger factor for asthma. The person already had asthma but the smoke caused an asthma attack. [1]  
In medicine , family history means information on medical disorders the direct blood relatives of a patient may have had. Many healthcare professionals look at the information on family medical problems, such as autism , diabetes , mental illness , autoimmune diseases , cancer . [1] Many medical conditions are carried only by the female line, including X-linked conditions. Others are carried by the male line, including Y-linked conditions. 
Fatty liver disease ( FLD ), also known as hepatic steatosis , is a condition where a lot of fat builds up in the liver . Sometimes, there are no or few symptoms. There can be pain in the upper right side of the abdomen . The disease can cause cirrhosis , liver cancer , and esophageal cuts. [1] 
 Female genital mutilation ( FGM ) is cutting off part or all of the female genitals that are outside of the body.  FGM is also called female genital cutting and female circumcision .  It is done for traditional reasons, as part of a ritual , not for medical reasons. FGM is most common in 27 African countries, as well as Yemen and Iraqi Kurdistan .  However, it also happens in other countries in Asia , the Middle East and around the world. [5] Usually, FGM is not done by a doctor or in a hospital . [6] It is often done with a razor blade or other sharp instruments, in many cases without anesthesia . Different ethnic groups do different kinds of FGM. They also do FGM at different ages.  Some groups do FGM when infants are only a few days old.  Others do it when girls reach puberty , or are older.  In about half the countries where FGM happens, most girls have FGM before they are five years old. [4] FGM can cause serious health problems, like infections , chronic pain , trouble getting pregnant and giving birth , bleeding so bad that it can kill. [7] FGM does not make a person's health better in any way. [8] 
Fetal viability is a medical and a legal term. It describes the ability of an unborn child to survive outside the womb . For the first three months of pregnancy , the unborn child is called embryo , after that it is called fetus . Usually, children are born after 40 weeks of pregnancy. Very few children are born before the mother reaches 24 weeks of pregnancy. If they are born alive, very few will survive. About 50 to 70 percent of children born from the 25th week of pregnancy will survive. In the 24th week, the survival chance is 30 to 50 percent. The point at which the child has a 50 percent chance of surviving is called limit of viability . 
Fetoscopy is a medical procedure to examine and treat an unborn child. It is only done in specialized hospitals. Because it is difficult to do, it is only done for severe illnesses. The complication that occurs most often is that the baby is born early , or that a miscarriage occurs. This happens in up to 5% of the cases. In many cases, fetoscopy is completented or replaced by medical ultrasound . 
First aid kits are used to perform first aid on injured people. A first aid kit often contains the following items:   
The term flat feet (also called a fallen arch ) is a medical condition in which human foot arches are very low or the entire sole of the human foot is touching the ground. Flat feet in children may become regular arches later on. [1] Adults with this condition may have problems involving arch development. The opposite, less common condition is called high arch .  
Fluoxetine hydrochloride is an antidepressant medication . It is used as a drug against various illnesses, like depression , obsessive-compulsive disorder , Panic disorder , and other illnesses. Fluoxetine is a one of a group of antidepressants called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). It is commonly known as Prozac . There are newer drugs available to treat these conditions. Nevertheless, it remains very popular. Over 23.1 million prescriptions for fluoxetine were filled in the United States in 2006. This makes it the third most prescribed antidepressant. [1]  
The Hôpital Foch is a well-known hospital in the Suresnes , close to Paris . It is one of Europe's largest hospitals. It has been created in 1929. He is partner of the Université de Versailles Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines . [1]    
Frontotemporal dementia ( FTD ) is the clinical presentation of frontotemporal lobar degeneration . It is characterized by progressive neuronal loss predominantly involving the frontal or temporal lobes , and typical loss of over 70% of spindle neurons , while other neuron types remain intact. [1] Second only to Alzheimer's disease (AD) in prevalence, FTD accounts for 20% of young-onset dementia cases. [2] Common signs and symptoms include significant changes in social and personal behavior, apathy, blunting of emotions, and deficits in both expressive and receptive language. 
A fugue state ( dissociative fugue or psychogenic fugue ) [1] is a rare psychiatric disorder . It involves temporary loss of memory ( amnesia ). It usually only lasts a short time (from hours to days), but can last months or longer. In a fugue state, the person not only forgets all about who they are, but may suddenly adopt a new identity . They may leave home and wander , settle in another area with a new name. Fugue occurs to avoid stress and anxiety . After the fugue state comes to an end, the person recovers the memories they lost, but usually forgets all that happened during the fugue. 
Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is a special type of MRI that makes it possible to watch different areas of a person's brain while they do different tasks. [1] A functional MRI shows the use of oxygen in different brain areas. The Deoxyhemoglobin in blood absorbs a radiowave signal and later emits it (sends it back out). Oxyhemoglobin does not. When an area of the brain is active, the blood flow to that area increases and more oxyhemoglobin is delivered to supply the active cells with oxygen. This means less of the signal is absorbed. An active area of the  brain absorbs and emits less energy than a less active area. This can be seen live as it is happening when different areas of the brain 'light up' on the images as they become less active. 
Gam-COVID-Vac ( Russian : Гам-КОВИД-Вак , romanized: Gam-KOVID-Vak ), trade-named Sputnik V , is a COVID-19 vaccine created by the Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology , and registered on 11 August 2020 by the Russian Ministry of Health . [1] [2] [3] Gam-COVID-Vac has been approved for distribution in Russia . [1] [4] [5] 
Gangliogliomas are tumors that start from groups of nerve cells (ganglion and glial cells) and grow in the brain . They are usually small and noncancerous, and they do not spread to other parts of the body. Gangliogliomas are rare tumors. Most gangliogliomas occur in children and young adults. Seizures , headache , vomiting , fatigue and weakness on one side of the body.  
Gastric bypass surgery is a surgery in which the stomach is divided and the gastrointestinal tract is redirected. The surgery is performed on people who have morbid obesity or have type 2 diabetes , high blood pressure or other weight-related health problems. As with all surgery, problems may occur. Some people could die after having the surgery. Gastric bypass surgery can be done using methods that make only small incisions (cuts) into the abdomen . It is one of the most difficult surgeries to perform that way. Advantages of using those methods include that patients don't have to stay in the hospital as long, they have less pain, it doesn't take as long to recover, and the scars are smaller. [1] 
Gastroenterology is a special type of medicine .  It is about the digestive system . Diseases of the gastrointestinal tract are the focus.  The tract includes the organs from mouth to anus . Physicians in this type of medicine are called gastroenterologists . 
Gastrointestinal bleeding ( GI bleed ), also known as gastrointestinal hemorrhage , is all forms of bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract , from the mouth to the rectum . [1] When there is significant blood loss over a short time, symptoms may include vomiting red blood , vomiting black blood , bloody stool , or black stool . Small amounts of bleeding over a long time may cause iron-deficiency anemia resulting in feeling tired or heart-related chest pain . Other symptoms may include abdominal pain , shortness of breath , pale skin , or passing out . Sometimes in those with small amounts of bleeding no symptoms may be present. [2] 
Gastrointestinal cancer refers to malignant conditions of the gastrointestinal tract (GI tract) and accessory organs of digestion , including the esophagus , stomach , biliary system , pancreas , small intestine , large intestine , rectum and anus . The symptoms relate to the organ affected and can include obstruction (leading to difficulty swallowing or defecating), abnormal bleeding or other associated problems. The diagnosis often requires endoscopy , followed by biopsy of suspicious tissue. The treatment depends on the location of the tumor, as well as the type of cancer cell and whether it has invaded other tissues or spread elsewhere. These factors also determine the prognosis. 
Medicine is the science that deals with diseases (illnesses) in humans and animals , the best ways to prevent diseases, and the best ways to return to a healthy condition. [1] People who practice medicine are most often called medical doctors or physicians. Often doctors work closely with nurses and many other types of health care professionals. Many doctors specialize in one kind of medical work. For example, pediatrics is the medical specialty about the health of children . [2] [3] In this specialty, the doctor is trained to provide anaesthesia and sedation. [4] This is important for surgeries and certain medical procedures. Anaesthesiologists also provide pre-operative assessments, ensuring the patient is safe during the operation and successfully awakens from anaesthesia after the operation. They assess for medical conditions and suitability for anaesthesia. They screen for risk factors prior to surgery and try to optimize the operative environment for the patient and the surgeon. They are the doctors who give epidurals during labor and delivery, provide spinal blocks, local nerve blocks, and general anaesthesia for procedures. They are the doctors who are especially trained in intubation (putting a tube into the lungs to help a person artificially breathe when the person is paralyzed and asleep during surgery). Hence, due to their skill in intubation, they are often the first line responders for emergencies. They help people who are in distress with their breathing, who have lost their airway or when their airway has become obstructed. 
Health is "a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease " according to the World Health Organization (WHO). [1] [2] Physical [ permanent dead link ] is about the body. Mental is about how people think and feel. Social talks about how people live with other people. It is about family , work, school, and friends. [3] Physical fitness refers to good body health. It is dependent on genetic determinators and also on social, economic and ecological factors. That means, one's genes are partly responsible for one's physical health, but also other circumstances: where you live, how clean or polluted your water and the air around you is and also how good your social and medical system is. It is also the result of regular exercise , proper diet and nutrition , and proper rest for physical recovery . A person who is physically fit will be able to walk or run without getting breathless and they will be able to carry out the activities of everyday living and not need help. How much each person can do will depend on their age and whether they are a man or woman. A physically fit person usually has a normal weight for their height. The relation between their height and weight is called their Body Mass Index . A taller person can be heavier and still be fit. If a person is too heavy or too thin for their height it may affect their health. [3] Better health is central to human happiness and well-being. It also makes an important contribution to economic progress, as healthy populations live longer, are more productive, and save more. Many factors influence health status and a country's ability to provide quality health services for its people. [4] Mental health refers to a person's emotional and psychological well-being. "A state of emotional and psychological well-being in which an individual is able to use his or her thinking and emotional (feeling) abilities, function in society , and meet the ordinary demands of everyday life." One way to think about mental health is by looking at how well a person functions. Feeling capable and efficient ; being able to handle normal levels of stress , have good friends and family, and lead an independent life; and being able to "bounce back," or recover from hardships, are all signs of mental health.It’s normal for all of us to feel worried, sad, upset, or have difficult emotions from time-to-time. For most people though, these feelings are only temporary and are resolved without causing any long-term problems. However, for some people, these negative feelings can become worse over time and lead to a mental health problem such as depression, anxiety, stress or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). [5] 
A disease or medical condition is an unhealthy state where something bad happens to the body or mind . [1] Diseases can cause pain , parts of the body to stop working the right way, or death. The word disease is sometimes used to include: A disease can be caused by many things.  Sometimes germs enter our body through food, water or air.  A person can be infected by infectious agents like bacteria , viruses or fungus . Disease can also be caused by eating bad or old foods . There are small germs in old foods that can cause diseases. Sometimes the germs produce chemicals or toxins which causes the disease. One of the most common causes of disease is poor sanitation and lack of clean water.  Some deadly diseases like malaria in tropical parts of the world are spread by a mosquito .  Animals that spread disease are called vectors . There are many vectors, including snails, ticks, and fleas. Some people are born with ' genetic diseases'. These are diseases because of an error or mutation in a person's DNA . An example of a mutation is cancer . Living or working in an unhealthy environment can also be a cause for diseases. Diseases are more common in older people. 
Medicine is the science that deals with diseases (illnesses) in humans and animals , the best ways to prevent diseases, and the best ways to return to a healthy condition. [1] People who practice medicine are most often called medical doctors or physicians. Often doctors work closely with nurses and many other types of health care professionals. Many doctors specialize in one kind of medical work. For example, pediatrics is the medical specialty about the health of children . [2] [3] In this specialty, the doctor is trained to provide anaesthesia and sedation. [4] This is important for surgeries and certain medical procedures. Anaesthesiologists also provide pre-operative assessments, ensuring the patient is safe during the operation and successfully awakens from anaesthesia after the operation. They assess for medical conditions and suitability for anaesthesia. They screen for risk factors prior to surgery and try to optimize the operative environment for the patient and the surgeon. They are the doctors who give epidurals during labor and delivery, provide spinal blocks, local nerve blocks, and general anaesthesia for procedures. They are the doctors who are especially trained in intubation (putting a tube into the lungs to help a person artificially breathe when the person is paralyzed and asleep during surgery). Hence, due to their skill in intubation, they are often the first line responders for emergencies. They help people who are in distress with their breathing, who have lost their airway or when their airway has become obstructed. 
The Abbott Laboratories [1] are an American pharmaceuticals and health care company. They have 90,000+ employees in over 130 countries. The headquarters are in North Chicago, Illinois . This organization was established by Wallace Calvin Abbott in 1888. Abbott's product line includes pharmaceuticals, nutritional, diagnostics, and vascular products. The company has made drugs for rheumatoid arthritis , diabetes and other conditions. The company makes glucose monitoring devices for diabetics. According to the Reuters report, Abbott acquired Alere for $4.48 billion, in April 2017. [2] In September 2017,  Abbott announced that it has received Food and Drug Administration clearance for a consumer version of its Freestyle Libre flash glucose monitor, which does not require people with diabetes to routinely prick their fingers to check the glucose levels. [3] [4] 
Abenomask is a Japanese political word named after Shinzo Abe . [1] It is used in Japan for two meanings: [2] [3] [4] [5] Abenomask-like actions are taken in other regions including Spain [6] and the United States [7] etc. 
In medicine , an acute disease or condition either happens for a short time, as in acute infection , or doesn't last long. The word acute may often be confused by the general public to mean ' severe '. This is different: something can be acute but not severe. The word acute is in the name of many diseases, for example, severe acute respiratory syndrome or acute leukemia . Acute hospitals are hospitals which are meant for short-term medical and/or surgical treatment and care. The related medical speciality is called acute medicine . Subacute is described as between acute and chronic. An example is subacute fever symptoms or subacute endocarditis . 
In medicine , an adverse effect is a harmful and undesired effect that results from a therapy like medication , chemotherapy , surgery or other intervention. An adverse effect may be called a "side-effect" (when it is less important than the therapeutic effect). It may result from an unsuitable or incorrect dosage or procedure (which could be caused by medical error). Some adverse effects happen only at the beginning or a change of a treatment. In many countries, adverse effects have to be reported and researched in clinical trials and included into the patient information accompanying medical devices and drugs for sale to the public. 
An antiseptic is a substance that is applied to lesions or wounds of the skin to kill germs . This helps prevent the wound becoming infected . Commonly used antiseptics include alcohol , iodine and mercury compounds . Antiseptics are different from antibiotics . Antiseptics can only be used on the skin, antibiotics can also be used internally, through the blood and lymphatic systems . They are also different from disinfectants : Disinfectants are used on non-living objects only, because they are dangerous to the living.  
An antivenom is a medicine used to protect against a specific venom. (A venom is a poison released by a snake or insect.) Frequently the venom of some creature such as a cobra will be harvested and a little will be injected using a hypodermic needle into a horse every day for a long time. The horse's body will develop an immunity to the venom, so more and more venom from the snake can be injected every day. After the horse is immune, its blood can be drawn little by little to get the part of the blood that makes the horse immune. That part can then be injected into humans who have been bitten by cobras. There are antivenoms for the very large and very dangerous funnel-web spiders found in Australia, and for the widow spiders (such as the black widow) found all around the world. 
The Apgar score is used in medicine .  It is a quick way of measuring how healthy a newborn baby is. Virginia Apgar invented the Apgar score in 1952. [1] [2] She was an anesthesiologist , and created the score to measure how babies were affected by anesthesia given to their mothers during childbirth . Today, the Apgar score is very commonly used by doctors , nurses , midwives , emergency medical technicians (EMTs), and other medical professionals.  One of the reasons it is so popular is that doing an Apgar test is very quick.  It usually takes less than a minute, sometimes just seconds. [1] When an Apgar test is done, five simple things about the newborn baby are checked.  The newborn gets a score of 0, 1, or 2 on each of these give things.  The scores are added up, and the total is the newborn's Apgar score. 
Argon plasma coagulation (APC) is the medical procedure to stop bleeding from an active bleeding site of the gastrointestinal tract. It is done with the help of endoscopy technique.  
Bacteria are used to test the effectiveness of disinfectants and antibiotics . Therefore, it is important that bacteria are not contaminated with other microorganisms . To prevent contamination, aseptic techniques are used. These include:  
A very important number for describing whether a disease can become an epidemic or not is R 0 , pronounced "R naught" or "R zero". It refers to how many people a person who has this disease is expected to infect on average. It is an abbreviation for basic reproduction number . If R 0 > 1, a disease can become an epidemic. If R 0 < 1, it cannot. Many known diseases have R 0 < 1 and cannot become epidemics. If they occur only occasionally, they are called sporadic. When there is a steady level of regular cases occurring in a region, the disease is called endemic. Doctors can use vaccines to make enough people immune in a population to stop epidemics from happening. We can also use other measures to make the effective reproduction rate (R e , usually written R t with t for time) lower than the basic reproduction rate (R 0 ). An example of a vaccine that works really well is the smallpox vaccine, which stopped smallpox virus from spreading so well that it no longer exists except in laboratories. Examples of making the effective reproduction rate lower than the basic reproduction rate are using condoms to stop sexually transmitted diseases from spreading or not getting close to others ( physical distancing , often called social distancing ) to stop respiratory diseases from spreading. 
A beating heart cadaver is the body of a dead person that has been connected to a medical ventilator. This will keep the organs of the dead body, including the heart , functioning and alive for a few days. [1] Such a body still functions physically, but the person it belonged to is dead by the law and medicine 's definition because there is no longer any conscious brain function possible. The procedure for caring for a beating heart cadaver is the same as caring for a normal patient. The body must be monitored at all times, and if necessary, "life saving" procedures must be taken. Since the brain does not work, the hormone levels and blood pressure must be controlled by doctors to keep the organs alive. Measures must be taken to prevent infection and maintain normal tissue oxygenation . [2] A beating heart cadaver is kept alive in order to keep its organs from decaying before they can be transplanted. Surgeons will remove the organs, one after the other, and give them to their patients. [1] The entire recovery process is usually completed within four hours. [2] This process was formerly known as an "Organ Harvest", but the name has since changed to the milder "Organ Recovery." [1] Many organs can be used, and many lives can be saved by one body.  The bodies are generally organ donors , who have agreed beforehand to donate their organs. [3] Some donated organs are taken from non-heart-beating donors . [4] Organs from brain deaths , however, have a better success rate, and currently most organ donation is from these deaths. [5] A beating heart cadaver is often disturbing and confusing. Because the heart is beating and the body is warm, people may have difficulty believing it is dead.  Families often like to see the body once it has been removed from the machines and put to rest. [2] 
Behaviour therapy is used for a number of methods of psychotherapy . Ivan Pavlov found that it is possible to "learn" how to react to a stimulus . His method is known as classical conditioning today. Behaviour therapy tries to use this knowledge to change the behaviour of people. In that way, people "learn" how to cope with their fears, for example. In a similar manner, people can be helped to cope with a number of mental disorders . One well known kind of behaviour therapy is exposure therapy : People with fears are "exposed" to them, and learn how to cope. As an example, someone who is afraid of spiders will be exposed to spiders. 
The word benign is often used to refer to a medical condition that will not become life-threatening if it is not treated , but can also mean that something is not harmful .  It is often used in relation to tumours that do not metastasise to other parts of the body .  Tumours that are referred to as being benign may still be life-threatening because of other reasons.  Because of this, the term applies mainly to their biological behaviour. Tumors that are benign may be at risk of changing into malignancy .  These are termed " premalignant ". 
Bioethics is a field of ethics in philosophy that studies the ethical, legal and social issues in medicine and biology . It is often used to study how the new discoveries in science will affect humans, animals and nature.  
Biomedical engineering is the study of medical equipment used in an environment of care or training and how this equipment interfaces with the human body . Biomedical engineers design , test , modify, recommend modification of, and evaluate all medical equipment used to interface or interact with the human body. In addition to these functions, clinical engineers usually supervise the biomedical equipment maintenance function within an environment of care. [1] The medical devices include man-made hands, arms, and legs to replace lost ones and, also, Dialysis machines which clean the blood of a person with damaged kidneys. 
A birth defect (or congenital disorder ) is a defect in a baby at birth, or which develop in the first month of life. [2] It is neutral as to whether the cause is genetic (inherited birth defect) or environmental (causes in the environment, that is, outside the foetus ). If a condition is said to be "congenital", that is neutral language. Often it is not known what causes a condition found at birth. In common use, it is often redirected to "birth defect". That term is also neutral as to cause. There are two main types of congenital defect. The first is caused by genetic abnormalities , which are hereditary . The second may be caused by conditions (such as infectious diseases ) which a baby may get. [3] However, we may not know what caused the condition. Sometimes doctors may find out that a baby has a congenital disorder before its birth. They use prenatal diagnosis and screening tests, such as amniocentesis . [4] 
In biology , a bolus (from the Latin word for ball ), is a ball-shaped living thing. In medicine , a bolus is a large amount of a drug given to patients to raise the blood level before treatment. A bolus can also refer to a ball of food after it has been chewed . It passes down the oesophagus by peristalsis . 
Bowel obstruction , also known as intestinal obstruction , is a mechanical or functional obstruction of the intestines which prevents the normal movement of the products of digestion . [1] [2] Either the small bowel or large bowel may be affected. [3] Signs and symptoms include abdominal pain , vomiting , bloating and not passing gas .  
Brine is water that has more than 5% salt in it. It is used for preserving food . For this it is much like vinegar or sugar . Brine is also used to transport heat . Adding salt to water lowers the freezing point of the water. The solubility of salt in water depends on temperature. At 15.5 ° Celsius , a saturated solution of brine can hold 26.4 % salt by weight. At 0°, it can hold 23.3% salt. Brines also have some pharmaceutical properties, which can be used to treat people, especially those with diseases of the skin , allergies and common colds . [1] 
A pharmaceutical capsule is an easy way to take medication . Capsules may contain powder , liquid or oil . [1] The outer shell is made of hard or soft gelatin . Capsules come in different shapes and colors to identify dose or what company made them. [1] They are also available as timed release which work over a period of time. Capsules should usually be taken whole. Always consult a pharmacist or desk reference before opening a capsule. Capsules should also not be crushed without first checking to see if it is safe. [2] 
Childbed fever is an bacterial infection of the female reproductive tract, which occurs after a woman has given birth or after a miscarriage . It is also known as postpartum infection , or puerperal fever . In the developed world, it affects about one to two percent of all births. It can develop into a life-threatening sepsis . Cesarean section is one of the risk factors. For this reason, all women undergoing a Cesarean section receive antibiotics . 
In medicine a chronic disease or condition is one that takes a long time to heal (or go away), or one that comes again.  Many chronic diseases require special treatment, as this has to be done for a long time. A chronic disease can even last for a lifetime.  
A clinical trial is one of the steps needed to introduce a new drug or therapy . Depending on the drug, either volunteers or patients suffering from a disease or condition are enrolled in a study. In general, a number of the people taking part will receive the real drug, or a good treatment, and the rest of the people will receive a treatment or drug that has no effect, called a placebo . These tests are statistical tests . Examples of study designs: Clinical trials were first introduced in Avicenna 's The Canon of Medicine in 1025 AD, where he laid down rules for the experimental use and testing of drugs . He wrote a precise guide for practical experimentation in the process of discovering and proving the effectiveness of medical drugs and substances . [1] He laid out the following rules and principles for testing the effectiveness of new drugs and medications , which still form the basis of modern clinical trials: [2] [3] One of the most famous clinical trials was James Lind 's demonstration in 1747 that citrus fruits cure scurvy . [4] He compared the effects of various different acidic substances, ranging from vinegar to cider, on groups of afflicted sailors, and found that the group who were given oranges and lemons had largely recovered from scurvy after 6 days. 
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy ( CBT ) is a type of psychotherapy which aims to help people transform their maladaptive thoughts and behaviours into a better state of being. Psychologists task patients to try out different situational coping skills and help patients to acknowledge, then challenge those problematic thought patterns , feelings and behaviors. [1] CBT refers to many types of psychotherapeutic systems that deal with cognitions , interpretations, beliefs and responses. These systems come from strategies commonly used in cognitive therapy and behavior therapy , combining them. [1] This combination is used to identify problems faced in the present and tries to improve the patient's current state of mind. [2] CBT has emerged as a common treatment for concerns regarding moods. It has become increasingly popular for reasons such as its defined structure and that it is based on common sense. [3] Research shows that CBT is the most effective form of treatment for those coping with depression and anxiety. CBT alone is 50-75% effective for overcoming depression and anxiety after 5 – 15 modules. Medication alone is effective, however, science still does not understand the long-term effects on the brain and body. There is evidence which suggests that CBT may be more cost-efficient in the long run in comparison to medication. Although, a combination of medication and CBT seems to be the most effective in overcoming mental illness. In particular, antidepressants paired with CBT could reduce potential relapses in patients facing depression. [4] CBT is often recommended for mood-related disorders such as depression and anxiety , but it can also treat personality disorders , post traumatic stress disorder and eating disorders . CBT can take place one-on-one between a therapist and a client, during group therapy, or online . In the early 1900s, Austrian psychotherapist Alfred Adler’s notion of basic mistakes and their role in unpleasant emotions made him one of the earliest therapists to address cognition in psychotherapy. His work inspired American psychologist Albert Ellis to develop rational emotive behaviour therapy (REBT) in the 1950s. This is now considered one of the earliest forms of cognitive psychotherapy. It is based on the idea that a person’s emotional distress arises from their thoughts about an event rather than the actual event itself. 
In medicine the term comorbidity is used to describe diseases and conditions that often occur together with another disease or condition. The first disease or disorder is called primary . In many cases, the primary condition or disease does not cause the comorbid disorders. However, they may both be caused or partly caused by the same thing, for example a genetic mutation or a traumatic experience. As an example, a patient may have antisocial personality disorder and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder . The two conditions are comorbid . Another patient might suffer from borderline personality disorder , posttraumatic stress disorder and bipolar disorder . The three conditions are comorbid . 
In medicine , compliance or adherence refers to the fact that a patient follows the advice of the doctor , and takes the prescribed drugs in the quantities prescribed. Compliance is important for the treatment of chronic diseases . Worldwide, non-compliance is a major obstacle to the effective delivery of health care. In 2003,   the World Health Organization estimated that only about half the patients with chronic diseases living in developed countries follow treatment recommendations. [1] In particular, low rates of adherence to therapies for asthma , diabetes , and hypertension are thought to contribute substantially to the human and economic burden of those conditions. [1] Compliance rates may be overestimated in the medical literature, as compliance is often high in the setting of a formal clinical trial but drops off in a "real-world" setting. [2] Some drugs are difficult to take, because they must be taken at a specific time or interval; sometimes, several drugs must be taken together. This is seen as a major obstacle to compliance.  Other factors that may adversely influence compliance are that many patients do not understand the benefits of being treated, or they see side-effects that they were not told about, the drugs costing a lot of money, poor communication or lack of trust between the patient and their health-care provider. [3] [4] Efforts to improve compliance have been aimed at simplifying drug packaging, providing effective medication reminders, improving patient education, and limiting the number of medications prescribed at the same time. 
Cow urine (गोमूत्र "Gomutra" in Hindi) is used as medicine mainly in India where cows are considered as holy by Hindus . [1] In addition cow urine is consumed as a drink by people believing it to boost the immunity. [2] Cow urine is one of the five contents of Panchagavya meaning five products obtained from a cow ( urine , milk , ghee , curd and dung ). Cow urine is also used in folk medicine in Myanmar , Nepal and Nigeria . [3] From ancient times it is used in Ayurveda medicine to treat leprosy , fever , peptic ulcers , liver diseases , kidney diseases , asthma , psoriasis , cancer and for weight loss in obesity . [4] [5] [6] Cow urine is used in organic farming as a fertilizer and to protect crops from fungal infections. [7] In addition cow urine is used as a floor cleaner and to manufacture cosmetic products like skin creams , bathing liquids and soap . [8] [9] [10] 
Cryonics (from Greek kryos , which means 'cold') is the process of vitrifying a human (or animal) about −196 degrees Celsius (−321 degrees Fahrenheit; 77 kelvins) after a doctor says they are dead. People do that in hope that, in the future when medicine becomes better, they can have life again, solve their health problems and have eternal life . Cold people like this are not awake at all as they have no brain activity . The law also says they are dead. Their body and its brain are made more like glass than ice because ice would harm their cells more. To do this, their blood is replaced with chemicals called cryoprotectants , which act like anti-freeze (stops to freeze). There are five big cryonics companies:  
A diagnosis is an accurate and precise account of the nature or cause of something. Medical diagnosis is the best-known field, but diagnosis can be applied to any subject. Whereas a doctor diagnoses what is wrong with a patient, a motor mechanic can diagnose the fault in a car. In all cases they replace a vague query, such as "My car will not start", with an exact analysis , such as "It's out of petrol". Notice the diagnosis is precise enough so the solution can be seen. These ideas work even in more subtle cases. A boy brings an insect in a box to a natural history museum. He asks an expert "What is this?" The expert says "You mean, apart from it being a beetle ?" When the boy nods, the expert looks at the insect under a magnifying glass, or a binocular microscope . Chances are, it is a common beetle, and the expert can give the boy quite a lot of information about it. But if it is not known to the expert, a much longer study is needed. Large reference books will be consulted; trays of similar insects will be taken out of store to be compared. A full diagnosis needs at least the genus and species . If the species is unknown, the detailed work of description is needed for publication. 
Doctor of Medicine ( MD , from the Latin Medicinæ Doctor meaning "Teacher of Medicine") is a doctoral degree for physicians (medical doctors). The degree is given by medical schools . It is a professional doctorate / first professional degree (qualifying degree) in some countries, including the United States and Canada . Students need to have completed 90 to 120 credit hours of university level work  (see second entry degree ) and in most cases should already have a Bachelors Degree. In other countries, such as the United Kingdom and Germany , the Doctor of Medicine is an advanced academic research degree similar to a PhD or a higher doctorate . [1] In Britain , Ireland , and many Commonwealth nations, the qualifying medical degree is the Bachelor of Science in Medicine, Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS, BMBS, BM BCh, BM, MB BCh BAO, or MB ChB) and is the same as the M.D. degree in the U.S. system. In these countries it is illegal to prescribe scrips ( prescriptions ) and perform operations without the basic degree; also usual is the membership of appropriate medical and/or surgical societies. The societies (such as the British Medical Association ) act as a kind of sophisticated trades union for doctors. In the British system, the General Medical Council has legal authority for the medical register of doctors licensed to practice medicine. They can and do hold tribunals to decide whether doctors accused of misdeeds should be struck off the medical register. Therefore, to practice it is necessary not only to hold the medical degree(s), but also to be on the register. 
The relationship between a doctor and a patient is a very important part of medicine . Only when there is a good relationship between the two is it possible to have high-quality healthcare . This relationship is also at the base of medical ethics . Many medical schools teach the doctors to be to keep a professional relationship with their patients, to respect the patients' dignity and privacy . This relationship has asymmetric information though. The doctor knows more than the patient, but has to explain the patient's situation, and has to ask the patient what treatments should be done. There is a very similar relationship between the patient and nurses , psychologists . There are different legal norms that regulate this relationship. Examples of such norms are the Hippocratic oath , the Declaration of Geneva . Professional responsibility may also govern such a relationship. Ideally, patient and doctor trust each other. If they do, this can have a positive influence on the development of disease or condition. Healing can be hindered if the patient does not take the prescribed drugs , of if these drugs are not taken in the doses prescribed. 
An Elizabethan collar , also called a, e-collar , lampshade or cone of shame is a piece of equipment used in veterinary medicine . [1] They stop the animal from licking or biting its body and from scratching or touching its head with its feet. [2] The veterinarian places the collar around the neck of an injured animal so that it cannot bite or lick the injured part of its body.  For example, a dog with a cut on its skin might need medicine placed directly on the cut. The dog might try to lick the medicine and poison itself.  An animal that has had surgery might try to pull out its stitches .  An animal with a broken leg might bite into its cast and try to pull it off.  If it is wearing an Elizabethan collar, it cannot do this. Some pet owners say their pets find it difficult to eat, drink and play while wearing an Elizabethan collar. [2] Veterinarians sometimes try other collars, like those made out of cloth, collars that look like inner-tube-shaped cushions, and collars that act more like a neck brace , stopping the animal from moving its head. [3] Elizabethan collars are named after Elizabethan ruffs , stiff, starched collars that people wore in 1500s England. 
ENCODE is the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements . Encode was launched in 2003 to identify all the functional elements (working bits) in the human genome . The work was done by over 400 scientists in 32 laboratories in the US , UK , Spain , Singapore and Japan . Their findings were published in 30 open-access papers in three journals, Nature , Genome Biology and Genome Research . It is the most detailed analysis to date of the human genome. A simplified account of their main findings is as follows: The methods used for the work included: News items connected with this work are: 
Eradication is the lowering of an infectious disease 's existence in the global host population to zero. [1] It is sometimes confused with elimination, which describes either the reduction of an infectious disease's prevalence in a regional population to zero. 
A risk factor in medicine is something that causes, or helps to cause, a medical condition.  For example, smoking or breathing in somebody else's tobacco smoke (called second-hand smoke) is a risk factor for emphysema and lung cancer . A trigger factor causes the symptoms of a medical condition to begin in a person who already has that medical condition. Example: Smoking or breathing in someone else's smoke can be a trigger factor for asthma. The person already had asthma but the smoke caused an asthma attack. [1]  
Fetal viability is a medical and a legal term. It describes the ability of an unborn child to survive outside the womb . For the first three months of pregnancy , the unborn child is called embryo , after that it is called fetus . Usually, children are born after 40 weeks of pregnancy. Very few children are born before the mother reaches 24 weeks of pregnancy. If they are born alive, very few will survive. About 50 to 70 percent of children born from the 25th week of pregnancy will survive. In the 24th week, the survival chance is 30 to 50 percent. The point at which the child has a 50 percent chance of surviving is called limit of viability . 
The First Geneva Convention is one of several Geneva Conventions . It is more formally known as the Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded in Armies in the Field, 1864 . It covers the treatment of battlefield injuries and was made in 1864 as part of the making of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement .  
Folding@Home is a distributed computing project that helps doctors at Stanford University learn about and cure diseases . [1] When parts of the human body do not work right, they make people sick. Folding@Home looks at the parts called proteins . When these proteins do not work right, they can make people sick with things like Alzheimer's , Mad Cow disease , and many types of cancer . [1] The project uses the idle processing resources of thousands of personal computers owned by volunteers who have installed the software on their systems. Instead of using an expensive supercomputer many user's computers can do the same work. The software was first available for the Sony PlayStation 3 . [2] It can also run in a Google Chrome window . [2] It is now available for a wide variety of Android mobile devices . [2] 
Genetic counselling , or counseling , is the process by which clients are advised about genetic disorders . Genetic disorders, by definition, can be passed on in heredity . Example: many descendents of Queen Victoria carried one or both alleles for haemophilia . It was a hereditary disease in European royal families. Clients with a disorder may be interested in the probability of developing or transmitting a genetic disorder to their children. They may ask what the options are to prevent, avoid or improve it. Facilities and rules vary in different countries. In the United States the National Society of Genetic Counselors defines genetic counselling as: [1] A genetic counsellor is an expert with a Master of Science degree in genetic counseling. In the United States they are certified by the American Board of Genetic Counseling. [2] Most enter the field from biology , genetics , nursing , psychology , public health and social work . Genetic counsellors need to be expert educators, skilled in translating ideas into terms that are easy to understand. 
Genetic screening in a broader sense includes biochemical tests for the possible presence of genetic diseases, or mutant forms of genes associated with increased risk of developing genetic disorders. Most of the time, testing is used to find changes that are associated with inherited disorders. The results of a genetic test can confirm or rule out a suspected genetic condition or help determine a person's chance of developing or passing on a genetic disorder . Several hundred genetic tests are currently in use, and more are being developed. [2] [3] Since genetic testing may open up ethical or psychological problems, genetic testing is often accompanied by genetic counselling . 
The Germ theory of disease is a theory in biology . It says that small organisms (called germs ), also known as microbes , cause some diseases . These diseases are called infectious diseases . The germ theory states that small organisms cause a reaction in the body of those who are infected. The body's reaction to infection is called a disease. Many scientists and doctors in history figured out that diseases are caused by microscopic organisms. Even after the microscope was invented, people still didn't know that germs caused diseases. People long believed that "bad air " from stinky trash dumps and from rotting meat was the cause of diseases. So people thought that covering their mouth and nose with a cloth would help filter out the "bad air." Scientists and doctors would use garlic and perfumes to ward off the bad air. But people still got sick and even died, so this theory was wrong. Polluted air is not the cause of disease. One problem with the old theories of disease was that people believed that living things were spontaneously generated. Spontaneous generation is when something like a fly grows from a small speck of smelly meat. That old theory is called abiogenesis . In the seventeenth century, Francesco Redi (February 18, 1626 – March 1, 1697) discovered that flies lay eggs that become maggots . Prior to this, people thought that maggots came from rotting meat. He discovered this by sealing some meat in a jar and watching it. No maggots were found on the sealed meat. He also put some meat in a jar and covered it with gauze. Maggots were found on the gauze but not inside the jar. But when he placed meat in an open jar, maggots were found on the meat and inside the jar. Experiments like this proved that maggots come from flies who lay eggs, not from rotting meat. Later scientists would prove that diseases did not come from the air. Diseases are spread by infection. Also in the eighteenth century, Antonie van Leeuwenhoek discovered the first microscopic organisms with a microscope. He was the first microbiologist. He saw some of the microscopic organisms that cause diseases, but he didn't know what they were. In 1700, Nicolas Andry thought that some of these microscopic organisms caused smallpox and other diseases. Over 100 years later, Agostino Bassi figured out what caused disease in silkworms . Ignaz Semmelweis was a doctor who figured out that if doctors washed their hands after touching dead people, that other patients wouldn't get sick. That was in 1847. It was about this time that sanitation and hand washing became popular with some, but not all doctors. Doctors began to use chemicals to cleanse wounds and clean their tools between each patient. 
GISAID is open-access to genetic data of influenza viruses, [3] and the coronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. [4] [5] On January 10, 2020, the first whole-genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 were made available on GISAID. This enabled global responses to the pandemic. [6] There was the first vaccines, [7] and diagnostic tests, [8] to detect SARS-CoV-2. GISAID helps watch for the emergence of new COVID-19 viral strains across the planet. [6] [9] Its establishment was an alternative to sharing avian influenza data by conventional public-domain archives. [10] [3] [11] GISAID has given rapid exchange of outbreak data [11] during the H1N1 pandemic [12] [13] in 2009, the H7N9 epidemic [14] [15] in 2013, and the COVID-19 pandemic [16] [17] in 2020. GISAID was recognized for its importance to world health by G20 health ministers in 2017, [18] and in 2020 the World Health Organization chief scientist called the data-science initiative "a game changer". [4] 
Glasgow Coma Scale or GCS is a scale that is used to measure the consciousness of a person. It was invented in 1974 by Graham Teasdale and Bryan J. Jennett , professors of neurosurgery at the University of Glasgow. GCS is used in evaluation of patients, especially in ICUs . This scale consists of three tests, which are described below. A score is given for each test, and the GCS score is calculated by adding the scores given to each test. The maximum score is 15, which means the patient is fully conscious. The minimum score is 3, and is usually seen in patients with brain death or those in deep coma . The scale comprises three tests: eye , verbal (talking) and motor (movement) responses. There are 4 grades for this test: 
Health care or healthcare is the preservation of mental and physical health by preventing or treating illnesses through services offered by the health profession and its staff. Health care includes all reasonable and necessary medical aid, medical examinations, medical treatments , medical diagnoses, medical evaluations and medical services. The right to health care is considered one of human rights with international human rights law as well as social security . A primary care doctor ( PCD ) or primary care physician ( PCP ) is a doctor who provides general medical care. These doctors can answer health concerns and medical conditions a patient may have. They also can prescribe medicine for their patients, based on information gathered. In 1968, Victor Skumin proposed the term ″Culture of Health″, which has become widespread. [2] [3] The main task of a Culture of Health is to implement innovative health programs that support a holistic approach to physical, mental and spiritual health . [4] Holism is the idea that natural systems ( physical , biological , chemical , social , economic , mental , linguistic , etc.) and their properties, should be viewed as wholes, not as collections of parts. According to Skumin, the culture of health is not only the mechanical connection of the two concepts —the concept of ″ culture ″ and the concept of ″ health ″. This is their synthesis , which forms a new quality, a new content. Skumin examines the culture of health as the specific science , that develops the theoretical and practical tasks of harmonious development of the spiritual, mental, and physical human force, forming of optimum environment, which provides a higher level of creativity of life. Thus, Skumin argues that the culture of health is a separate science, that creates new content. The main challenge of culture of health is the development of spiritual, mental and physical capabilities of man.  In 1994, Skumin was elected to the post of the President-founder of the World Organisation of Culture of Health ( WOCH ) — International social movement "To Health via Culture". [5] [6] 
Herd immunity (also called herd effect , community immunity , population immunity , or social immunity ) is a form of protection from infectious disease . This happens when a large percentage of a population has become immune to an infection, whether through previous infections or vaccination . [1] [2] When many individuals have immunity, they do not spread the disease any more. This either stops or slows the spread of disease. [3] 
A hospice is a type of medical treatment that helps take care of people who are very sick and have an illness that they will not be able to heal from. Many people staying in hospices have cancer or AIDS . [1] People who stay in hospices are expected to die soon, but sometimes they get better. Hospices are different from other medicinal treatments because they mostly try to make people feel better instead of trying to cure them. Hospice tries to allow people to die with as little pain as possible. Hospices have doctors , nurses , and other people who go to patients houses, nursing homes and hospitals to talk to people who want to use hospice medicine. The Hospice movement was started in England in the 1950s by a nurse named Dame Cicely Saunders. [2] The word Dame at the start of her name means that she did such good work starting hospices that the Queen of England made her a female knight . A different nurse named Florence Wald brought hospice medicine to the United States because she worked with Dame Cicely Saunders and liked what she did. 
The human microbiome (or human microbiota ) is the collection of microorganisms which live on us. They live on the skin, in the saliva and mouth, in the eyes, and in the gut and the rest of the gastrointestinal tract . They include bacteria , archaea , fungi and single- celled eukaryotes (' protozoa '). [1] Everyone carries around far more of these microbes than the number of human cells in the body. The human body has about 100 trillion cells , and carries about ten times as many microorganisms in the intestines alone . [2] [3] [4] [5] The microbiome is "the ecological community of commensal , symbiotic , and pathogenic microorganisms that literally share our body space". [6] [7] The term was originally coined by Joshua Lederberg . He thought the microorganisms living in the human body in health and disease were important. Many scientific articles distinguish "microbiome" and " microbiota " to describe either the collective genomes of the microorganisms that live in an environmental niche or the microorganisms themselves, respectively. [8] [9] [10] However, by the original definitions these terms are largely synonymous . Some of these organisms are useful for humans. However, most have no known effect. They are just symbionts : they live with us. Those which are expected to be present are members of the normal flora . Under normal circumstances they do not cause disease, but may even help our health. Studies in 2009 asked whether our health is damaged if we reduce this biota. [11] This is certainly the case with gut flora . [3] Although "flora" refers to plants rather than bacteria, the term 'gut flora' is widely used and familiar to biologists. ' Biota ' refers to the total collection of organisms in an ecosystem . The term 'microbiota' is best for bacteria and other microorganisms, but no doubt 'flora' will often be used. 
Hydrochloric acid is a chemical compound . It is a solution of hydrogen chloride ( H Cl ) gas that is dissolved in water . In the past, people called it muriatic acid . It is widely used in industry, and it is also made by the stomach to help digest food. Hydrochloric acid, like all acids , react with bases to produce salts ( chlorides ). In high concentrations , hydrochloric acid can make acidic mists. Both the mist and the solution hurt human tissue. They are caustic , and can cause chemical burns . These can damage the eyes , the skin , the respiratory system , and other organs of the human body . When hydrochloric acid is mixed with certain chemicals such as bleach , the toxic gas chlorine is made. When working with hydrochloric acid, certain safety measures should be taken. These include using rubber or PVC gloves , wearing goggles to protect the eyes, as well as special clothing that is resistant to chemicals. Hydrochloric acid reacts with some metals, corroding them and making flammable hydrogen gas. 
Informed consent is the right of a citizen who will undergo medical treatment or care to know about the kind of treatment or service that will be provided by the doctor as well as the procedures involved. It also includes the right to refuse any treatment or care without prior approval. Informed consent is part of the medical ethics to avoid medical abuse or accidents. It has been admitted as one of the human rights in some international agreements, and also in the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities .  
An inhaler is a device for taking medications that are breathed in. Inhalers are also called "puffers" by some people, and used for all sorts of respiratory problems including asthmatic disorders. 
Interventional radiology is defined as the branch of medicine that diagnoses and treats a wide range of diseases using actions that are performed through the skin (for example an injection) or carried out with the least damage by x-rays , sonography , and so on. Some of these procedures are done only for diagnostic purposes, while others are done for treatment purposes. Images are used to direct these procedures, which are usually done with needles or other tiny instruments like small tubes called catheters. The images provide road maps that allow the Interventional Radiologist to guide these instruments through the body to the areas containing diseases. 
The Lancet is a weekly peer reviewed general medical journal . [1] The journal was founded in 1823 by Thomas Wakley , an English surgeon . The word "lancet" has two meanings: a surgical knife, and an architectural term " lancet arch ", [2] a window with a sharp pointed arch. This might suggest  the "light of wisdom" or "to let in light". The journal publishes original research articles, review articles (" seminars " and " reviews "), editorials, book reviews, correspondence, as well as news features and case reports. The Lancet has been owned by Elsevier since 1991. [3] The journal has editorial offices in London , New York , and Beijing . 
Light therapy is a treatment where the patient is exposed to light . Depression , sleeping problems , and many skin disorders are treated with this therapy. The therapy consists of exposing the patient to a light source. The light source usually emits the full spectrum of light. Sometimes, this has to be done at a specific time of day.  
Liraglutide (marketed with brand name Victoza ) is a Type 2 diabetes medication. It is a long-acting glucagon like peptide-1 agonist. It was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in early 2010. This medication is a once daily treatment of Type 2 diabetes. 
Medical abbreviations are a shorthand way of writing and talking by medical professionals (people who work to help sick people) to hurry explanation of diseases (sickness), patients, or medicines (drugs). This shorthand can include shortening (making less lengthy) of longer disease names, by cutting the word down to its base (the Latin or Greek part that makes it). Medical professionals also create (make) words that mean something. An example of this is "stat", used to indicate (show) that something needs to be hurried (done faster). It is from the Latin "base word" statim, meaning quick. A very commonly (often) used shorthand is shortening things on order forms for patients. An example is, "pre-op" meaning |pre-operation| (patient who is being prepared for surgery ). These can be very complicated and extensive (meaning there is a lot of them). Despite the fact that this shorthand might make it difficult for new Interns (new doctors ) or recently trained nurses to get used to this unofficial language, it has been shown to improve (make better) the speed of treatment in hospitals. Medical authorities in the United Kingdom and elsewhere have questioned the use of medical shorthand; believing that it can lead to mistakes being made due to less clear communication and have advised doctors to avoid its use. [1] 
In medicine , malignant is a clinical word that is used to describe an illness that kills a patient fast. A malignant tumor is a tumor that is able to invade nearby tissues and spread to tissues that are not nearby.  Not all patients diagnosed with malignant tumors die, because of the improved treatments available.  The actual prognosis depends on the type of tumor, its differentiation, and how bad the disease is.  The term malignant is typically applied to neoplasms that show aggressive behavior characterized by local invasion or distant metastasis . 
A medical diagnosis ( an. Greek δια-γνωστικος — able to recognize) is when a doctor finds out what is making someone sick. [1] Sometimes doctors can diagnose a sickness by asking the person questions and looking at the person's body. Sometimes doctors do tests . Tests can mean taking a small bit of blood , urine , or tissue which is sent to a hospital laboratory where it is tested. X-rays are another form of test. Tests are ways to see how the body is working. When a diagnosis has been made, the doctor may recommend treatment . The process of diagnosis begins from the very beginning of the patient's examination in a medical institution or during a call to the doctor at the patient's place of residence. Diagnosis of the disease begins with the collection of medical history. After collecting the anamnesis, the doctor examines the patient, during which he performs percussion and auscultation of the patient, palpation of the disease, measures the patient's blood pressure , heart rate and respiration rate, and measures the patient's body temperature . Laboratory examination methods include general clinical tests, which include a general blood test, a general urine test, and a stool test. Laboratory methods of examination also include biochemical methods of examination, during which the level of glucose, creatinine, urea, bilirubin, liver enzymes, blood lipids is determined; coagulogram, which analyzes the indicators of blood clotting; blood hormone tests; determination of tumor markers; tests of blood and other biological materials for infectious diseases; allergological , toxicological , cytological and parasitological examinations. 
Medical ethics is the set of ethical rules that doctors follow. These ideas tell doctors how they should treat patients. The earliest set of ethical ideas in medicine was the Hippocratic oath . (An oath is a special promise.) It was supposed to be written by Hippocrates but probably was not written by him. There are 6 major principles (important ideas): Here are some kinds of medical ethics questions: 
The Medical Journal of Australia is a peer-reviewed medical journal . It is the official journal of the Australian Medical Association and began in 1914. It is published by the Australasian Medical Publishing Company Proprietary Limited (AMPCo). The journal publishes editorials , articles, case reports, and letters. The full text of every issue since January 2002 is available on their website. [1]  
Medical microbiology , also known as ‘’’clinical microbiology’’’, is the study of microbes , such as bacteria , viruses , fungi and parasites , which cause human illness and their role in the disease. The microbes and the branch of microbiology are the most studied due to their great importance to medicine . [1] Medical microbiology studies development and progress of the infectious disease in a patient and in human population ( epidemiology ). It is related to the study of disease pathology and immunology . It is a branch of medicine and microbiology and includes five sciences: bacteriology , virology , parasitology , immunology and mycology . In 1546, Girolamo Fracastoro proposed that epidemic diseases were caused by transferable seed like entities through direct, indirect contact and contact over long distances with an infection . 
The Medical Renaissance from 1400 to 1700 AD is a period of progress in European medical knowledge. There was a new interest in the ideas of the ancient Greeks and Romans . The medical discoveries during the Medical Renaissance paved the way for modern medicine. [1] [2] Progress made during the Medical Renaissance depended on several things. [3] [4] By studying anatomy they learnt the positions of bones , muscles , and organs . Andreas Vesalius published De humani corporis fabrica (On the fabric of the human body) in 1543. [5] That was the first time in history that realistic diagrams of dissections were published. Much later (1628) the Englishman William Harvey discovered that blood is pumped by the heart, travels through the body in blood vessels, and returns back to the heart in the circulatory system. [6] Thus basic facts of anatomy and physiology began to be understood by physicians . However, Harvey's work belongs to a later period. At the beginning of the period, in 1400, doctors were ignorant of physiology and had some (to us) pretty strange ideas. In the renaissance, a very important theory in medicine was the Four humours or Four temperaments. This theory had begun with the Ancient Greeks , and influenced medical development until the 19th century. According to the theory, the body was filled with four different substances, called humours . When a person is healthy, these substances are in balance. When there is an imbalance between the humours, the person will be sick. The sickness can be cured by bringing the four humours back to balance. The four substances are: black bile , yellow bile, phlegm and blood . The Roman medic Galen still supported that theory, but refined it in many ways. 
Medical Subject Headings ( MeSH ) is a way to keep track of for the purpose of journal articles and books in the life sciences; it can also serve as a thesaurus that makes searching easier. Created and updated by the United States National Library of Medicine (NLM), it is used by the MEDLINE / PubMed article database and by NLM's catalog of book holdings. MeSH was introduced in 1963. The yearly printed version was discontinued in 2007 and MeSH is now available online only. [1] It can be browsed and downloaded free of charge through PubMed . Originally in English, MeSH has been translated into numerous other languages and allows retrieval of documents from different languages. 
Medical Tourism is when patients visit other countries for medical care. The patients usually come from developed countries to find treatment at lower prices. Over 50 countries have identified medical tourism as a national industry. [1] Examples of common medical procedures done for medical tourists are surgeries like joint replacement, heart surgery, cosmetic surgery , dental treatment , and addictions rehabilitation (or recovery from addiction). [2] The term medical tourism can also be called medical travel, health tourism or global healthcare. it was initially developed by travel agencies and the mass media to describe the rapidly-growing practice of travelling across international borders to obtain health care.mainly it is for curing people and a lot of countries believe on this. Countries that are popular for Medical Tourism are: 
MedlinePlus is a free website that gives free consumer health information for patients , families, and health care providers. The site has information from the United States National Library of Medicine , the National Institutes of Health (NIH), other U.S. government agencies, and health-related organizations.  The U.S. National Library of Medicine produces and maintains the site.  MedlinePlus includes a companion site in Spanish, [1] which offers similar content for the Spanish-speaking community.  It also offers a mobile site in both English and Spanish optimized for display on mobile devices.  Over 150 million people from around the world use MedlinePlus each year. [2] MedlinePlus contains: 
Mental capacity in law is a term used to describe a person's ability to make decisions for themselves and to understand what those decisions will mean for them. Sometimes, people who are unwell, such as those with illnesses which affect their memory ( Alzheimer's disease or Dementia ), those with learning difficulties , or who have mental health problems, may find themselves in a position where their ability to make decisions for themselves is questioned.  This may be because they do not understand that what they are doing is not good for them; they do not realise that it might make them ill or get them into trouble. People can also lack capacity if they are unable to communicate in any way; for example, if they're in a coma or if they have severe brain damage .  In this case, it may be necessary for someone else, such as an advocate or a Judge to make decisions for them by making a court order . In some countries, like the United Kingdom , laws exist which tell those working with people whose capacity might be in doubt, what they must do and how to decide if someone is capable of making their own decisions.  In the UK, this law is called the Mental Capacity Act (2005). [1] It lists 5 rules which must be used as a guide; in simple terms, they are: 
A midwife is a professional in midwifery . Their education and training equips them to recognise the variations of normal progress of labor, and understand how to deal with deviations from normal.  
A Mobile Army Surgical Hospital (or M.A.S.H. or MASH ) was a medical center used during wars , to care and fix injured soldiers who got hurt in the fighting. They were an alternative to field hospitals and real hospitals which were used in World War II . During the Korean War , thanks to these kinds of hospitals, soldiers had a 97% chance of surviving an injury. They were also used in the Vietnam War and the first Gulf War , but were gradually replaced by Combat Support Hospitals or CSHs which are used today. Many people know about these places due to a well-known movie and later TV show called M*A*S*H , which was set was a hospital like this during the Korean War .  
A morgue is a place where dead human bodies are kept for a short time soon after the person died. Sometimes, the body is examined by autopsy . Most often, the body is delivered to a mortuary and buried in a grave or cremated . Morgues are found in hospitals , usually on the lowest floor or basement.  
Naturopathy is a form of alternative medicine . It is based on the belief that a special energy called "vital energy" guides bodily functions such as metabolism , reproduction and growth . [1] Naturopaths mostly use holistic forms of treatment. They generally avoid the use of surgery and drugs . Many naturopaths reject modern science. Naturopathy is not supported by science. [2] The medical community does not believe that it works. [2] [3] The term "naturopathy" comes from Greek and Latin. It means "nature disease". [4] Modern naturopathy developed from the Natural Cure movement in Europe. [5] [6]  
An online pharmacy is a pharmacy that operates on the Internet to sell medications to consumers.  There are online pharmacies in many countries of the world—from India, the U.S., Germany, the UK—and many other nations that sell to consumers in their own countries and often to consumers worldwide. Depending on its location and local regulations, an online pharmacy may or may not require prescriptions to purchase prescription medications. Prices at a given online pharmacy can vary from one city or country to another.  Typically, drug prices at online pharmacies located in countries with drug price controls in place (i.e., India, UK, Germany, South Africa) will have more affordable costs.  In contrast, costs at pharmacies in countries where there are no drug price controls (i.e., U.S.) will usually be much higher.  Especially for consumers seeking low-priced medications, it can be very worthwhile to compare prices at various online pharmacies.  Prices can vary as much as 80 percent or more for one medication from one country to another.  
The opioid crisis or opioid pandemic is the problems with opioid drugs .  Too many people became addicted to opioids. [1] The crisis started in the United States in the 1990s.  Since then, about 450,000 people have died from opioids in the United States. Most of the people who died took opioids as regular drugs and became addicted. Only a small number of people used the drugs illegally. According to the United States Centers for Disease Control, the opioid crisis costs $78.5 billion a year in the United States alone. [1] Opioids are moderately strong, to strong painkillers . Despite the high risks, associated with addiction and overdose, they are relatively easy to get. Opioids can have sedative properties. They are useful for treating actute pain; [2] but they are not as effective when treating chronic pain. [3] When looking at chronic pain, the risks often outweigh the benefits. [3] In 1996, the company Purdue Pharma wanted to sell a number of drugs containing opioids.  They told doctors that patients would probably not become addicted, so the doctors prescribed opioids to many patients, even if they did not really need them.  Many of those patients became addicted. [1] In 2007, Purdue Pharma was fined $635 million.  The judge said this was because Purdue Pharma did not warn customers about the side effects enough. Since then, there have been other similar lawsuits . 
An oxygen concentrator is a machine that takes in air and takes out some of the nitrogen (as N 2 ) so there is more oxygen (as O 2 ). This new air with more oxygen is then given to a patient during oxygen therapy . 
Oxygen therapy , also called supplemental oxygen , is when oxygen gas (O 2 ) is used for medical treatment by giving the gas to the patient for inhalation . [1] It can be used for ilnesses like hypoxia , carbon monoxide toxicity , and cluster headaches . [2] It can be used over a long time for people who suffer with illnesses that lower oxygen levels in the blood like COPD and cystic fibrosis . [3] It can be given in a few different ways such as through a nasal cannula , face mask , or inside a hyperbaric chamber . [4] [5] Oxygen levels need to be high enough for respiration to keep a patient healthy and for normal cell metabolism . [6] 
A patient is a person receiving medical care and/or treatment. 
A peripheral nerve block (or simply nerve block ) is when the signals travelling along a nerve are blocked. This is usually done deliberately, usually as a form of anesthesia . Such a block can last between a few hours to a few weeks. 
A pharmacy is a shop where therapeutic drugs are sold. Sometimes a pharmacy is also called a drug store or chemist and druggist store . The people working in a pharmacy are called pharmacists , druggist or chemists (British English). These people can recognise simple diseases and formulate or dispense drugs for some of them. Certain drugs are special, because they can be addictive , or they change the way other drugs act, or they need to be taken in a special way. These drugs cannot simply be bought at a pharmacy. A prescription is necessary to get them. Medical doctors give out prescriptions, which can then be used to get the drug. Many pharmacies do not sell drugs only. They also sell beauty products and hygiene -related products, like tampons for women and contraceptives . Pharmacy is also a branch of chemistry that studies the molecular structure of drugs to find better drugs. 
Physical dependence is a term used in medicine : If a drug is taken regularly, a certain level of tolerance may have developed. Abruptly stopping to use the drug will cause drug withdrawal symptoms. If the drug has been taken for a longer period of time, or the dosage was higher, the withdrawal symptoms will be more severe. Well known drugs with withdrawal symptoms include opioids , alcohol , and may of the drugs knownn as neuroleptics . 
Physiotherapy is also called "physical therapy". It attempts to treat what limits a person's abilities to move and do things in their daily life. [1] It is the treatment of disease, injury, deformity or disability to improve the quality of life. Physiotherapists use exercise, hands-on technique, patient education and various modalities. Physiotherapy plays an important role in the recovery of stroke patients. It also plays a major role in treating children with cerebral palsy , and in cardiopulmonary rehabilitation . Physiotherapy has three main categories which are orthopedics , neurophysiotherapy , and cardiorespiratory physiotherapy . Sports physiotherapists specialise in the strains and injuries caused to sportspeople. 
A Plague doctor was a doctor in the 1300s who tried to stop plague from spreading. The doctors would also carry canes to poke bodies to test if they were still alive and to remind them to stay the correct distance away.  The doctors could also examine patients using the cane.  The doctors would wear large masks that looked like birds' beaks.  This was because people believed the plague spread on bad air.  The beaks of the masks were filled with plants, vinegar sponges, or perfume to protect the doctor from the bad air.  Plague doctors wore robes covered in wax so body fluids would not stick to it.  They wore glass goggles over their eyes.  They would wear goggles if they could. [1] [2] People in the Venetian Carnival dress as plague doctors. [1] 
Plumpy'Nut is a peanut -based paste wrapped in plastic, used to treat severe malnutrition . It's manufactured by Nutriset , a French company. [2] [3] The paste removes the need for hospitalization , and the 92-gram (3¼ oz) packages of it can be eaten at home and allows larger numbers of people to be treated.  
Prenatal testing or Prenatal diagnosis are tests done on pregnant women. They are used to test fetuses for birth defects and some genetic disorders . Prenatal tests can be non-invasive or invasive.  Non-invasive tests include things like utrasounds . In invasive tests, a needle is inserted - for example, to get a sample of fluid from the placenta ). Prenatal tests can check for many conditions, like: In some cases, the tests are administered to determine if the parents want to abort the fetus. 
Prognosis refers to the expected course/outcome of a disease . 
Prophylaxis is a Greek word and concept . It means any action taken to guard or prevent beforehand . The corresponding adjective is prophylactic . The concept of prophylaxis has two parts. First is forethought . A person has to realise the need first of all. Second is taking appropriate action . Any failure of prophylaxis is a failure at either stage 1 or stage 2. Successful prophylaxis means one has anticipated and avoided some undesirable outcome . Prophylaxis is the central idea in preventative medicine . People usually think medical treatment helps sick people to get healthy. Prophylactic treatment is helpful in a different way. Primary prophylaxis tries to stop healthy people from getting sick. Secondary prophylaxis tries to stop people who are sick from getting worse. 
Pseudoallergy is something a living body does when it takes a new medicine for the first time.  A pseudollergic response, can mean an anaphylactic reaction, which means too much water leaves the blood.  A pseudoallery is not an immune response.  Human beings can die from pseudoallergies. [1] 
Psychopathology is the study of mental illnesses . It was started by Karl Jaspers in 1913.  
Public health is the science dealing with prevention there is a disease that is a threat to the overall health of a community, as well as with prolonging life and promoting health . [1] The aims are achieved through the organized efforts and informed choices of society, public and private organizations, communities and individuals. It bases on health analysis of a handful of people or all the inhabitants of several continents rather than on an individual.  Public health includes such parts as epidemiology , [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] biostatistics , [9] health services, environmental , social, behavioral , and occupational health . [10] Public health intervention prevents rather than treats a disease through surveillance of cases and promotes healthy behaviors such as hand washing , vaccination programs and distribution of condoms . In outbreaks of an infectious disease , treating a disease may be vital to preventing it in others. Most countries have their own government public health agencies, sometimes known as ministries of health, to respond to domestic health issues. Many diseases are preventable through simple, non-medical methods. Public health plays an important role in disease prevention efforts in the developing world and in developed countries, through local health systems and through international non-governmental organizations . In the developing world, there may not be enough trained health workers or monetary resources to provide a basic level of medical care and disease prevention. 
PubMed is a free online database of references on life sciences . [1] It was established in January 1996. [2] The United States National Library of Medicine (NLM) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) maintains the database. [1] Each record in the PubMed database is assigned a special number to identify it. [1] This is the PMID , an acronym for " P ub M ed ID entifier" number. [3] PMIDs do not change over time and they are never reused. [4] Any PMID is only a number. The PMID tells the reader nothing about the type or quality of the content of any publication.  
A randomized controlled trial is a special method of doing a scientific experiment which can reduce certain  sources of bias . It is often used in the context of testing whether drugs are effective against a set of symptoms . When doing the test, the participants are randomly put into different groups. Each group is treated differently, and at the end the results are compared. A common case is that one group will receive a placebo drug, while the other will receive the real one. The trial is called blinded , if the participants, or those giving the drugs do not know what group a patient is in. Controlled studies and trials have been done for a long time. In 1753, James Lind published a study that shows that scurvy could be treated by a diet including many lemons and oranges . Ignaz Semmelweis , a Hungarian doctor in Vienna, established the term "systematic controlled observation". Semmelweis is known today because he linked an increase in childbed fever to missing hygiene in hospitals . At the end of the 19th century, the first problem of not assigning people to test groups randomly became apparent. Austin Bradford Hill established the term "randomized controlled trial" in the 1940s. He did a study regarduing the treatment of tuberculosis with Streptomycin (an antibiotic) in the 1940s. This study is seen as thew first randomized controlled triall. [1] 
Reaction Agostini is the name of a simplified examination for the presence of glucose in human urine . The method consists of preparing a solution of sodium chloride and potassium oxide , adding the urine to be investigated. If there is glucose present, the solution becomes red. [1]  
The Royal College of Physicians of London was the first medical group in England to receive a Royal Charter. It was created in 1518 and is one of the most active of all medical groups. It was originally created as the College of Physicians by royal charter of King Henry VIII in 1518.   
In medicine , saline refers to any solution of salt in water ; that is, salt water . Such solutions are sterile when they are to be placed into the body by infusion or injection . If the solution has more salt in it than is found in the human body, it is called hypertonic saline . The normal salt level is 0.9% and any salt amount more than 0.9% is called hypertonic.  
Septic shock is a medical condition which can result from sepsis . Sepsis is a special form of infection . With septic shock, the circulation of blood changes or stops. This makes septic shock a medical emergency ,which is usually treated in intensive care . Between a quarter and half the people with the condition die. Treatment is usually done in the following steps: 
Social distancing , also less confusingly called physical distancing is one way to help stop the spread of infection from viruses and bacteria between people. The goal is to lower the chance for an infection to spread from person to person. This can reduce the number of infected people at one time, which lowers the burden on health care. By lowering the number of people who get sick, lives can also be saved. [1] [2] Social distancing works for infections that are spread by droplets (cough or sneeze), physical contact, contaminated surfaces, or in the air. [3] Social distancing does not work well for infections that are spread through food, water, or insects. [4] Types of social distancing are: All of these may have negative effects on people. [12] [13] [14] However, these may be preferred to the effects of a specific disease. 
The therapeutic index is a number that tells how safe it is to use a drug. It is obtained by dividing two numbers: the dose needed so that half of all individuals show the desired effect, and the dose which will kill half of all the individuals. 
Therapy , in the medical field also called treatment , is what people do to try to solve or care for a health problem, physical or mental . When a person is ill or injured , a doctor may make a medical diagnosis and then recommend a therapy to try to make the person well.  The therapy can be, for example, medications (drugs), surgery or a change of diet . A person who does therapy as a job is called a therapist. There are many kinds of therapists. [1] for example: Medical treatments may have four results:  
Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is a branch of traditional medicine from China . It is at least 3,500 years old. Treatments include herbal medicine , acupuncture , cupping , massage , and exercise . Since the methods of TCM are different from Western medicine , it is hard to find evidence that shows how safe or good TCM really is. Many of the most important ideas in TCM are based on the teachings of Daoism . Based on the teachings of TCM, it is important to balance the five elements in a person's body: wood, fire, earth, metal, and water. Each element also has something called yin and yang , or opposite values that must exist alongside each other rather than to overcome the other. The way to balance the yin and yang is to strengthen qi , or an invisible force that brings balance to the yin and yang . Knowing the five elements and the yin and yang is important because each organ of the body is related to one of the five elements. It is important to strengthen a person's qi because balancing the yin and yang of a person's organs is important for people to be healthy. [1] The different treatments in TCM are made to bring balance to the elements in a person's body. These ideas are similar to, but not the same as, the four temperaments , which was an widely-believed theory in European medicine before scientific medicine was created.  
Traditional medicine is a branch of medicine where treatment is based on knowledge passed on within certain cultures before the era of modern medicine.  
The Unité de formation et de recherche médicale Paris Île-de-France Ouest (in English Paris Île-de-France West Medical Research and Training Departement; also called PIFO or Paris Ouest ) is a department of the Université de Versailles Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines [1] focus on research and training activities in medicine .  
Veterinary medicine is a branch of medicine that deals with the health of animals . It is the study and practice of preventing, diagnosing and treating disease and injuries in animals. Veterinary medicine covers all species of animals, including both domesticated animals and wild animals. People who study and practice veterinary medicine professionally are called veterinarians (often known as "vets"). Veterinary science tries to help human health by monitoring and controlling zoonotic diseases ( infectious diseases transmitted from animals to humans).  
Pain is a symptom of being hurt or sick. It is a bad sensation that is physical and emotional. Most pain starts when part of the body is hurt. Nerves in that part send messages to the brain . Those messages tell the brain that the body is being damaged . Pain is not just the message the nerve sends to the brain. It is the bad emotion felt because of that damage. The message that the nerve sends to the brain is called nociception . What is experienced because of the nociception is pain. Pain can be acute or chronic . Acute means it only happens a short time. Chronic means the pain lasts a long time. 
Abdominal pain (also called a stomach ache ) is a pain or ache in the abdomen . It can be caused by different things, including food poisoning , indigestion , constipation , gastritis , an ulcer , hunger , appendicitis , stomach cancer or diverticulitis .  
An anesthetic or anaesthetic is a substance that stops pain .  It makes people either stop hurting, or go completely to sleep during surgery .  Anesthetic can be rubbed onto the skin, given by injection ("shot"), or given as a gas to breathe .  The use of an anesthetic is called anaesthesia.  Anaesthesia blocks the pain during operations.  This lets patients undergo surgery and other procedures without the distress and pain they would normally feel.  It comes from Greek roots an-, "without" and aesthetos, "perceptible, able to feel". The modern anesthetic was created by Joseph Lister .  Before it, people sometimes used cocaine , alcohol , and other drugs. Modern anaesthesia is highly complex and often involves a combination of anaesthesia, analgesia and muscle relaxation to enable physicians to do their part. These three tasks are known as the triad of anaesthesia.  
Fibromyalgia is a condition with chronic pain . The exact causes are not known. However, symptoms are not totally restricted to the pain. There are also sleep disturbances, joint stiffness and severe fatigue. The problem sometimes exists along with depression , stress and anxiety . Fibromyalgia affects mostly women, though men can also be affected. Adults are usually the victims, although children may also be affected.  symptoms- widespread pain,if you have fibromyalgia,one of the main symptoms is most likely to be widespread pain... Extreme sensitivity... Stiffness... fatigue... poor sleep quality... congnitive prombles [ fibro-fog] 
A headache is when your head hurts. It is not when you hit your head with something and made it hurt that way, but when your head hurts from inside. A headache can be caused by one of several things, which are listed here: The second edition of the International Headache Classification (ICHD-2) defines more than 220 different types of headaches in three categories: [1] Many headaches can be relieved with analgesics like aspirin . 
Interstitial cystitis ( IC ), also called bladder pain syndrome ( BPS ), is a disease that causes pain in the bladder . [3]  
A migraine is a medical condition which usually causes a pounding, throbbing headache on one side of the head. The pain may be very bad and hurt so much that a person may have a hard time doing anything. While most people who have migraines get a headache, not everyone does. There are different kinds of migraines, and some do not cause a headache but do have other symptoms . Most migraines cause a headache and nausea and might make the person dizzy or very sensitive to bright lights or loud noises. Some people have " auras " before a migraine starts, which means their ability to see becomes different. They may see funny patterns, have blurry vision, or may not be able to see at all. Other senses can change before or during a migraine, and the person may sense funny smells or tastes. Migraines can last a long time. Migraines usually last between four and 72 hours. Migraines have been classified, based on how often they happen in a month: If a person has a headache for less than fifteen days, the migraine is called episodic migraine (EM).  If it happens more than fifteen days, it is called chronic migraine (CM). Chronic means it happens over a long amount of time. Some people who start off getting episodic migraines may start to get chronic migraines later. Chronic migraine then may revert or go back to episodic migraine. Scientists have discovered that something called CGRP is the cause of migraines. CGRP stands for "calcitonin gene-related peptide". CGRP is a protein that causes migraines when it is released around the brain. What CGRP does, is that it causes a lot of inflammation in the meninges , a covering above the brain. 
Myalgia means " muscle pain " and is a symptom of many diseases and disorders. The most common causes are the overuse or over-stretching of a muscle or group of muscles. Myalgia without a traumatic history can be due to viral infections .  
Neck pain is a common problem, and two thirds of people will experience neck pain at some point in their lifetimes. Although neck pain is felt in the neck, it can also be caused by many other spinal problems. Neck pain may be caused by tight muscles in the neck and upper back or compression of the spinal nerves in the neck. Injuries to the joints of the neck and upper back can also cause pain. 
Pain disorder is a condition where a patient experiences chronic pain in different places in the body; this pain seems to be caused by psychological stress . Treatment of the condition can be done with either therapy or drugs .  
Sore throat or throat pain is pain in a person's throat . About 7.5% or ​ 3 ⁄ 40 of people have sore throat in any three-month period. Most of the time, it is caused by viral pharyngitis . It can also be caused by bad tonsils , trauma , strep throat , tumors , and other problems. Treatment varies with the different causes, but the painful symptoms can be helped with medicine such as cough drops or, in China , pear-syrup candy . 
Suffering is pain or mental or emotional unhappiness caused by bad things happening, like disasters or illness . It is an important topic in philosophy , and religion . Much health care exists to help people who are suffering.  
A tension headache is a common form of headache . Tension headaches affect the head , eyes and nearby areas of the body. They are very common with adults. Females are twice as likely as males to have them. [1] Tension headaches may be caused by:  
A toothache is a pain felt in a person's tooth , normally when the tooth is hurt. A tooth can be hurt by tooth decay caused by plaque or by an injury .  
Symptoms are used in diagnosis . The term is used in medicine , and in other fields such as fault-finding in engineering . In medicine, it refers to things the patient feels or notices. It contrasts with signs , which are changes which a doctor sees in a patient. What a patient feels is subjective , whereas what a doctor sees is objective . In diagnosis, all symptoms and signs are brought together to make a hypothesis as to what is going wrong. This might suggest further investigation or treatment. A complete investigation ends with a diagnosis that  summarizes all this.

Amnesia is a what doctors call a loss or disturbance of memory . It is a loss of memory, that is to say, a person cannot remember certain things. Amnesia can be caused when someone has brain damage , a disease or when something really stressful happens. There are two "main types": The fact that adults usually cannot remember events that occurred in early childhood is called "infantile amnesia". It is attributed to the development of the brain or that of the child. It is not seen as a form of amnesia comparable to the other types. There are three main categories in which amnesia can happen to a person. 
In psychology , anhedonia (< Greek αν- an-, without + ηδονή hēdonē, pleasure ) is not being able to feel pleasure . This may include not enjoying things like eating, exercise, watching movies, meeting friends, social activities, or sexual interaction and activity. In most cases, anhedonia is caused by mental disorders . It happens in some severe cases of depression and it is a common symptom of schizophrenia , schizoid personality disorder and major depressive disorder . 
Anosmia is losing the the sense of smell . The word is also used for people who never had this sense. The loss can be temporary, or permanent. The conditions that cause a temporary loss of this sense include: Smelling things depends on two nerves ( Nervus olfactorius and Nervus trigeminus ), as well as the part of the brain which processes the information. Damage to this system will affect the sense of smell; permanent damage may lead to a permanent loss of the sense of small. There are tests that can be done to find the cause of the problem. The sense of smell also affects the sense of taste . People who cannot small smell have only the basic tastes: sweet , sour , bitter , salty , and umami . 
The painting Starry Night by Vincent van Gogh who suffered from migraine, is his impression of a migraine aura. [1] An aura is the changes that people see, hear, smell, taste, or feel before they have an epileptic seizure , or before they have a migraine . It comes from the Greek word for breeze. The cause of the aura is related to the way the brain works, so this is a neurological condition. There are different kinds of migraines. About 15% of people who have a migraine will have an aura. The symptoms may include visual problems like not being able to see for a short time, seeing zig-zag lines or floating spots, dizziness , a ringing noise in the ears (tinnitus), and problems speaking. [2] It may take up to an hour after the aura begins before a person starts getting a migraine. Many people with epilepsy have an aura before having a seizure.  This can be helpful, because the aura can tell the person that a seizure is coming ahead of time, and give them time to get to a safe place.  The time between the aura and the seizure is usually short (often from seconds to minutes). 
Automatic behaviour is the name for a set of actions that occur (or that continue to occur), without conscious thought. Usually, they are guided by a part of the nervous system that is called autonomic nervous system , or visceral nervous system. Automatic behaviour is like a reflex . Many mental illnesses have certain forms of unwanted automatic behaviour.  
Bibliomania can be a symptom of obsessive-compulsive disorder , by collecting of books to the point where social relations or health are in danger. It can be connected to stealing ( kleptomania ) of books. Bibliomania is not to be confused with bibliophilia , which is the usual love of books. Don Quixote may be the most famous bibliomaniac in fiction . 
Blunt trauma is a kind of trauma that usually results from being hit by something dull and firm (like a car, a fist, or the ground).  It is also called blunt force trauma . This is different from penetrating trauma where an object, such as a bullet enters the body. Common types of blunt force trauma include: [1] If blunt force trauma is not too severe, it may cause only cuts (lacerations), bruises (contusions), and scrapes (abrasions).  However, bad blunt force trauma can cause many serious problems, like: [1]  
Catalepsy is a nervous condition. The body is fixed, with rigid muscles and fixed posture . The body position does not respond to stimuli , and there is  decreased sensitivity to pain . [1] Catalepsy is a symptom of certain nervous disorders or conditions such as Parkinson's disease and epilepsy . It is also a characteristic symptom of cocaine withdrawal. It may be caused by schizophrenia treatment with anti-psychotics such as haloperidol . [2] [3] It may be caused by the anaesthetic ketamine . [4] In some cases, catalepsy may be started by  an extreme emotional shock – one well known example of this was the reaction of 1968 Olympic long jump medalist Bob Beamon on finding he had broken the previous world record by over 0.5 meters (2 feet). [5] Protein kinase A has been suggested as a mediator of cataleptic behavior. [6] 
Chorea (sometimes called Choreia ) is the name for a set of symptoms caused by some neurological conditions . The word "chorea" comes from Greek , where it means " dance ". People with chorea move without being able to control those movements. The movements seem to spread from one muscle to the next. Chorea is one of the main symptoms of Huntington's disease . Some forms of chorea are not linked to neurological conditions, though. Chorea can develop as a complication of pregnancy .  It can be a sign of hyperthyroidism . It can also be caused by drugs taken in the wrong dose. For example, L-Dopa (taken against Parkinson's disease ), certain forms of birth control , or certain antipsychotics can cause chorea if they are used in the wrong doses. 
Coma is a medical term. It is a state of deep unconsciousness . People who are in that state cannot be woken up. They also do not react to pain or light . Coma can result from various conditions . Some of these are intoxication , poisons , damages or diseases of the nervous system . It can also be the result of certain drugs . Doctors sometimes put patients that have very bad injuries into a coma. There are different levels of coma. Comas usually do not last more than several weeks, but those several weeks could be disastrous . Sometimes only basic bodily functions are left over. Intensive hospital care is often needed to recover some of these functions. Some comas can last years, but these are usually not woken up from. The family of a coma victim (or whoever has the power of Attorney ) can sign papers so that they are taken off of life support and then will die .  
A cough , also known as tussis , is an action the body takes to get rid of anything that irritates the lungs or throat. To do this, muscles in the thoracic cavity contract to make air leave the lungs with a lot of force. Coughs often happen quickly and more than once, and are usually accompanied by a unique sound, also called a cough. Coughs are more likely to happen when a person is sick, because infections often irritate breathing passages. Another cause of coughs is a person breathing air that is not clean like dust .  
Delirium is a medical term. The condition is also known as acute confusional state . Doctors use it to describe patients who have lost parts or all of their ability to focus attention. People who suffer from it  may also have problems to concentrate, or to remember things or  other people. Delirium is a medical symptom . It is not a disease. A delirium can have many causes. The most common ones include: There are several definitions of what constitutes a delirium, but in general, the following is true: Deliria are often treated with special drugs , called antipsychotics . 
Delirium tremens (often called DTs or " the DTs ") is a medical emergency .  It is the worst form of alcohol withdrawal , [1] [2] which can happen when a person who drinks a lot of alcohol suddenly stops drinking. " Delirium " means very bad confusion that comes on quickly; "tremens" means "shaking." Scientists think the DTs happen because the autonomic nervous system gets too excited.  It works too hard and will not shut off. [3] DTs were first written about in 1813. [4] [5] Most people who stop drinking alcohol do not get the DTs. But some people are more likely to get the DTs if they suddenly stop drinking. DTs are more likely in people who: [6] 
Depression is a state of low mood and not wanting to do anything. It can change what a person thinks, does, feels, and sense of well-being. It may lead to being sad, make it harder to think and a large change in appetite and time spent sleeping. People who have depression may feel no hope and, sometimes, thoughts of suicide . It can either be short term or long term. [1] The main symptom of depression is said to be anhedonia , which means losing of interest in things that usually make people happy. [2] Depressed mood is a symptom of some mood disorders such as major depressive disorder or dysthymia ; [3] it is a normal reaction to life events, such as losing a loved one; and it is also caused by some physical diseases and a side effect of some drugs and medical treatments. 
Diarrhea (DIE-uh-REE-uh), also spelled diarrhoea , happens when the body makes more watery feces than normal.  Diarrhea can occur in humans as well as most other mammals. Diarrhea is not a disease .  But it may be a symptom of a disease.  The most common causes of diarrhea are: [1] In developing nations , diarrheal diseases are the second most common cause of death in children under age 5. [2] Every year in the world, diarrhea kills around 760,000 children under age 5. [2] In developing countries, diarrhea is also one of the most common causes of malnutrition in children under age 5. [2] 
Erythema ab igne is a rash of the skin , which is usually caused by the long-term exposure to heat or infrared radiation , [1] and which is not a burn . Usually the name is abbreviated EAI . Other names include hot water bottle rash [2] fire stains , [3] laptop thigh , granny's tartan and toasted skin syndrome . [3] Some people may complain of mild itchiness and a burning sensation. When a change in skin pigmentation can not be seen, it is often not noticed at all.  
Both perception ("experiencing") and remembering are processes which involve the brain . For this reason, errors do sometimes occur. Errors in perception are commonly called illusions . Emil Kraepelin used the term "Erinnerungsverfälschung" (memory falsification) to speak about false memories . [1] [2] [3] Perceptions need stimuli to be created. A perception without a stimulus is called hallucination . Much like the difference between illusion and hallucination, Kraepelin wanted to distinguish between a false memory and memories of something that did not really happen, which he called "Erinnerkungsfälschung". Unfortunately, both German terms translate to the same English term. A false memory is a condition where a person remembers something that did not occur or where the memory does not closely match the occurrence. Using suggestion and hypnosis , it is possible to make people believe they experienced something, when they did not. Such phenomena also occur spontaneously, for example in a stressful situation , or when someone is not sleeping enough . 
A fasciculation , or "muscle twitch", is a small, local, involuntary muscle contraction and relaxation . At times it may be visible under the skin. Deeper areas can be detected by EMG testing. A fasciculation can happen in any skeletal muscle in the body . Fasciculations can occur in normal healthy people. [1] One uncommon reason for them is due to a lower motor neuron lesion that may be caused by any of several diseases . One example would be Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis .  
A fever is when a person's body temperature is hotter than 37.5 degrees Celsius (99.5 Fahrenheit ). Normal body temperature for humans varies based on a variety of factors, including age and level of physical activity. [1] It is typically cited as 37 degrees Celsius (98.6 F), but naturally varies from person to person by at least .5 degrees Celsius. The actual measurement of body temperature will vary based on the location of the measurement.  For a temperature taken from under the tongue , the measurement may be lower. Rectal temperatures will read about 0.3 C (0.55 F) higher, and armpit temperatures will read about the same amount lower. When people are ill, their body's immune system fights the disease , and so the body temperature rises. Fever is a defensive measure of the body against the germs: the life cycles of the germs are disrupted when the body temperature rises. About 38 °C (100.4 F) degrees is called a low-grade fever, and above 39.5 °C (103 F) degrees is a high-grade fever. Children usually have a higher fever than adults; their immune system is less mature. Infants have the highest normal temperature, which decreases as people age. Some animals, especially small ones like rabbits and cats , also have a higher normal temperature than humans. 
The word fistula comes from a Latin word that means tube or pipe . In medicine , a fistula is an abnormal connection between two hollow spaces. This can be blood vessels , intestines , or other hollow organs . Fistulas are usually caused by injury or surgery . But they can also result from an infection or inflammation . [1] Fistulas are generally a disease condition, but doctors may create fistulas by surgery for medical reasons. Treatment for fistula depends on the reason for the fistula and on how serious it is.  Doctors often treat fistula with surgery and antibiotics . The first step in treating a fistula is usually an examination by a doctor.  The doctor determines the size and "path" that the fistula takes in the body. 
Frequent urination is the urge to urinate more often than usual. Diuretics are substances that cause frequent urination. The most common cause of frequent urination is an infection of the urinary tract . Frequent urination does not need to be linked to a disease, though: things like being pregnant or being stressed can also cause it. 
Gangrene is a serious medical condition that causes the decay and death of body tissue , usually in the extremities such as the fingers, hands, toes, and feet. The two main types of gangrene are dry gangrene and wet gangrene. A third less common type is a form of wet gangrene known as gas gangrene .  A very rare type which affects the internal organs is known as internal gangrene. Dry gangrene is usually caused by a loss of blood supply to the affected area, such as may happen following an injury which damages the blood vessels to the affected area. Wet gangrene usually occurs when a wound becomes infected with various types of bacteria . Gas gangrene is usually  caused by clostridium bacteria and mainly affects the muscles . Internal gangrene affects the internal organs, usually the intestines , gallbladder , or appendix . There are a number of risk factors which increase a person's chances of getting gangrene. These includes advanced blockage of the arteries in medical conditions such as diabetes .  
Gynecomastia is when the breast in male humans are bigger than normal. [1] It has been known to be a symptom of obesity . [2] 
Halitosis is a symptom where a person has bad breath. It can be caused by bad dental care, tooth decay or gum disease . 
A headache is when your head hurts. It is not when you hit your head with something and made it hurt that way, but when your head hurts from inside. A headache can be caused by one of several things, which are listed here: The second edition of the International Headache Classification (ICHD-2) defines more than 220 different types of headaches in three categories: [1] Many headaches can be relieved with analgesics like aspirin . 
Heartburn is an uncomfortable feeling in the chest that happens when acids from the stomach travel up the esophagus (the tube leading from the mouth to the stomach). When stomach acids hurt the lining of the esophagus, the feeling is a symptom . [1] The burning sensation is commonly called "heartburn," but it has nothing to do with the heart . [2] The symptom may be helped by taking antacids , such as calcium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate . [3]  
Hyperactivity (word derived from Greek : ὑπέρ "hyper" and Latin : agere, actum "to act") can be described as a physical state. People who have it can not control their overactive behavior and are abnormally active. [1]  
Hysteria is when someone has a very strong emotion that is unmanageable. Often, this means a very strong sense of fear . When someone has hysteria, it is called "hysterics". Hysteria could be caused by traumatic events in a person's life. Today, many psychiatrists and other doctors do not use the word "hysteria" for a patient. They use other words that have the same meaning. Some of the words they may use are "psychosomatic", "functional", "nonorganic", "psychogenic", or "medically unexplained". One of the conditions of hysteria may be Histrionic personality disorder . 
Itch ( Latin : pruritus ) is an unpleasant sensation that leads to the desire or reflex to scratch . Itch has many similarities to pain and both are unpleasant sensory experiences but their behavioral response patterns are different. Pain creates a reflex withdrawal while itch leads to a scratch reflex. [1] Nerve fibers for itch and pain both are in the skin , but information for them is sent centrally in two distinct systems that both use the same nerve bundle. [2] Historically, the sensations of itch and pain have not been considered to be independent of each other until recently where it was found that itch has several features in common with pain but has important differences. [3] The feeling of itchiness can be caused by a movement of hair or the release of a chemical ( histamine ) from cells under the skin. Itchiness is regarded as protective, as it helps creatures remove parasites that land on their skin. Itching can be caused by: 
Jaundice (also called icterus ) is when the skin and the whites of the eyes become a yellow color. [1] People with jaundice have a problem with their liver , which stops it from removing heme properly. Heme (from hemoglobin) changes to a chemical called bilirubin after red blood cell death. [1] Bilirubin causes the yellow coloring of the skin. Jaundice is common in newly born babies . It usually starts the second day after birth. [2] Jaundice can also be caused by other diseases, like malaria , hepatitis , or gallstones. Jaundice is the most common of all liver problems. The yellow colour of the skin and mucous membranes happens because of an increase in the bile pigment, bilirubin, in the blood . [2] The bile , made by the liver, is a vital digestive fluid needed for proper nutrition. It also stops decaying changes in food. If the bile is stopped from entering the intestines there is an increase in gases and other products. Normally, the production of bile and its flow is constant. 
Mass hysteria is a phenomenon when a large group of people share a common emotion .  This emotion can be positive, such as people being euphoric at a rock concert, or it can be negative, like after a great person or statesman died. It was first used by the Quarteerly Christian Spectator in 1830, to describe an outbreak of cholera . [1]  
Mental confusion (often simply called confusion ) is a symptom . People suffering from it have problems finding their way around in the world. They have troubles remembering who they are, where they are, or what time (or day of the week) it is. Additionally, they may have trouble remembering things or memorizing new things. This may be linked to problems focusing their attention. Confusion can also be a sign of someone being sick with various illnesses when it's coupled with things like fever, chills, or exhaustion. Confusion can be caused by many different medical problems. There are both acute and chronic causes of confusion. Acute causes of confusion usually come on suddenly, and doctors may be able to fix some of them. 
Nausea is a general feeling of unease and discomfort in the stomach , often with the urge to vomit . The word nausea comes from the Latin word for seasickness . [1] Nausea is a symptom , rather than an illness or disease . The causes for it very often are not in the stomach itself, but somewhere else in the body. Nausea is often caused by a stomach virus. Nausea is usually harmless, in the short term. A good treatment for it can be not to take solid food (and to only drink non-alcoholic drinks, like water). Nausea can also occur during pregnancy , and is quite normal in that context. People can suffer nausea without vomiting. 
Pallor (also known as paleness ) is when the skin is a pale color. [1] It can be caused by illness , stress or even shock. Pallor is seen most easily on the face and palms . It can develop suddenly or slowly. Causes of pallor may include migraines , headache , hypoglycemia , anemia or scarlet fever .  
A persistent vegetative state is what happens when a person in a coma becomes somewhat aware of what is happening around them.  However, they have little or no control over their body.  Most people who are in a PVS cannot live without medicine or machinery, such as a ventilator .  
Intellectual disability is also called mental retardation, intellectual developmental disability, or general learning disability . [1] It is an illness of the brain. Intellectual disability often starts when someone is very young. To have an intellectual disability, a person must: [2] There are two major types of intellectual disability. The first is syndromic intellectual disability . This means that the person has a syndrome that causes intellectual disability, as well as medical issues and other problems. Down syndrome and fetal alcohol syndrome are two examples of syndromic intellectual disabilities. 
A phantom smell or olfactory hallucination is smelling an odor that is not actually there. It is also called phantosmia. It can occur in one nostril or both. Phantosmia with unpleasant smells, which is called cacosmia, is more common. It is often described as smelling something that is burned, foul, spoiled, or rotten. Experiencing phantom smells from time to time is normal and usually goes away on its own. [1] When hallucinations of this type do not seem to go away or when they keep coming back, this can be very upsetting and can lower an individual's quality of life. [2] Common medical conditions such as nasal infections, nasal polyps, or dental problems can cause phantom smells. A phantom smell can also result from neurological conditions such as migraines , head injuries, strokes , Parkinson's disease , seizures , or brain tumors . It can also be a symptom of certain mental disorders such as depression , bipolar disorder , intoxication or withdrawal from  drugs and alcohol, or psychotic disorders . Certain substances in the environment can also cause phantom smells. These include tobacco smoke, certain types of chemicals (e.g., insecticides or solvents ), or radiation treatment for head or neck cancer. A physician can determine if the problem is with the sense of smell ( olfactory system ) or taste ( gustatory system ), or if it is caused by a neurological or psychiatric disorder. Phantosmia usually goes away on its own. Sometimes this occurs step by step. The process can take several years. When a phantom smell is caused by an illness (e.g., sinusitis ), it should go away with theillness. If the problem persists or causes significant discomfort, a doctor might recommend nasal saline drops, antidepressant or anticonvulsant medications, anesthesia to parts of the nose, or in very rare circumstances, surgical procedures to remove the olfactory nerves or bulbs . 
Polydipsia is excessive thirst or excess drinking. The word derives from the Greek πολυδίψιος ( poludípsios ) "very thirsty", which is gotten from πολύς ( polús , "much, many") + δίψα ( dípsa , "thirst"). Polydipsia is a symptom in many diseases . It also occurs as a weird behaviour in some animals , such as in birds . [1] Polydipsia can be a symptom of diabetes mellitus . It is seen in cases of poorly controlled diabetes. Diabetes insipidus can also cause polydipsia. [1] It can also be caused by a change in the osmolality of the extracellular fluids of the body, hypokalemia , decreased blood volume, and other conditions that create water deficiency. [1] Polydipsia is a symptom and not a disease in itself. Polydipsia investigations at diagnosing diabetes insipidus and diabetes mellitus can be useful. [1] 
Retching (also called dry heaving or gagging ) is when the motion of the stomach and esophagus goes backward, but there is no vomiting . It can be caused by bad smells, choking or stopping certain medications . It can also be because of stress . Retching is different from vomiting. During a retch, pressure in the thorax goes down and pressure in the abdomen goes up. In vomiting, both pressures go up. 
Retrograde amnesia is a type of amnesia when someone cannot remember what happened before the event that caused the memory loss (such as a head injury). This is different from anterograde amnesia , when someone cannot remember what happened after the event.  
Schizophreniform disorder is a mental illness . Usually, people suffering from this disorder show certain symptoms of schizophrenia , but they do not have all of them, or the symptoms are not present long enough. To be recognised as schizophrenia, the symptoms need to be present a full six months. If symptoms are not present for that time period, the illness may be classified as shizophreniform disorder. The disorder can be treated in much the same way as schizophrenia. There are certain antipsychotic drugs and therapies that can help treat the symptoms. 
Sexual addiction is when people engage in sexual activities, especially sexual intercourse , even if this has negative consequences for them. [1] Some scientists believe it is one of several sex-related disorders within an umbrella concept known as hypersexual disorder . [2] The term sexual dependence is also used to refer to people who report being unable to control their sexual urges , behaviors, or thoughts.  Other related models of pathological sexual behavior include hypersexuality (nymphomania and satyriasis), erotomania , Don Juanism (or Don Juanitaism), and paraphilia -related disorders. [3] [4] [5] Not all people agree that the condition sexual addicion exists. [6] [7] There is considerable debate among psychiatrists , psychologists , sexologists , and other specialists whether compulsive sexual behavior constitutes an addiction. They also disagree about its  classification and possible diagnosis. Research on animals has shown that compulsive sexual behavior uses the same mechanism of action that is also responsible for drug addiction in laboratory animals. As of 2018, neither  the DSM or ICD medical classifications recognise sexual addiction as a valid diagnosis. 
Sinusitis means infection or inflammation of the sinuses , which are air-filled spaces inside the bones of the face. There are many symptoms, including thick nasal mucus , a plugged nose, and pain in the face. [1] 
When people are dreaming , their muscles do not move, even if in their dream they are moving. This is a natural process which prevents that people actually perform the movements they do in their sleep. In general, people are not aware of this inability to move, as it usually stops as soon as they wake up. People suffering from sleep paralysis wake up and find that they are unable to move. This is because the paralysis has not stopped. Usually it lasts for only a few minutes, and people have said they feel a "presence" or " ghost " during it. Little is known about the physiology of sleep paralysis. However, some have suggested that it may be linked to post- synaptic (neurons sending signals to other neurons) inhibition (restraint) of nerves in the pons (back) region of the brain . In particular, low levels of melatonin may stop the depolarization current in the nerves, which stops stimulation of the muscles. Hallucinations of ghosts, demons and Out of Body Experiences during sleep paralysis may be caused by a part of the brain called the parietal lobe (top-middle part of the brain), and by neurons known as mirror neurons. [2] [3] [4] Studies suggest that many people get sleep paralysis at least once in their lives. People who have narcolepsy often get it much more. Many people try to induce sleep paralysis, to have an Out of Body Experience . 
Somnolence (also sleepiness or drowsiness ) is a strong desire for sleep . It is also sleeping for unusually long periods. It can refer to the usual state before falling asleep. It can be accompanied by lethargy , weakness and difficulty thinking. [1] Sleepiness can be dangerous when performing tasks that require constant concentration, such as driving a vehicle . 
Stevens–Johnson syndrome is a disease of the skin . In most cases, it is caused by an allergic reaction to drugs . This accounts for about half the cases. Lymphoma , and other infections are responsible for most other cases. The disease is characterized by cell death that causes the epidermis to separate from the dermis . Since this is similar to what happens in burn, some of the same methods are used to treat patients.  
Syncope is the medical term for fainting or blacking out . It is a sudden loss of consciousness , usually for a short time. It is mostly because there is not enough oxygen in the brain . It can be for other reasons. Fainting is quite common. It usually happens in two age ranges: the teenage years, and during older age. The chance of a person fainting at least once in a lifetime is about 40 to 50 percent. Syncope causes 1 to 3 percent of all attendances to emergency departments and 1 to 6 percent of all hospital admissions. [1] [2] 
In psychiatry, the term thought disorder or formal thought disorder refers to a condition where people have problems with consistent and straight thinking leading to abnormalities e.g. with spoken and written language . The people who have this condition use language that is disordered, or sometimes hard to follow. According to the psychiatrists, language is a reflection of thought processes. People who have difficulty speaking therefore often also have difficulty thinking. Thought disorder is considered to be a symptom of psychotic mental illness , but there can also be other causes for it. [1] The condition it describes is permanent. It affects speech and writing . Those affected may speak all the time, or they may show patterns like switching ideas inside a sentence. They may also use different words that do not fit together at all; this is known as ' word salad '. Eugen Bleuler , who named schizophrenia , held that its defining characteristic was a disorder of the thinking process. [2] However, although the delusions and hallucinations of psychosis could also be considered as disorders of thought, the term formal thought disorder applies specifically to the presumed disruption in the flow of conscious verbal thought that is inferred from spoken language. This is typically what is referred to when the strictly less accurate, more commonly used but abbreviated term, 'thought disorder', is used. 
Tinnitus is a symptom of hearing loss and other hearing problems. It is described as hearing sound in the head or ears that does not come from an outside source. [1] Many people will hear ringing, buzzing, hissing or whistling sounds, but tinnitus can be other sounds such as roaring and humming as well. Different people will hear different sounds from tinnitus but how they hear it can also be different. Tinnitus can be loud or quiet and it can be continuous or occasional and some people will not notice their tinnitus but some people become very annoyed from it, especially when then feel tired or stressed. There are many things that can cause people to get tinnitus. These are the main reasons: People of different range of age can develop tinnitus. It is not a disorder but the symptom of some underlying health condition. 
Vomiting , also called puking , is emptying the contents of stomach through mouth . It can be either food or liquid in the stomach. It can be from infection , contaminated food or drink ( food poisoning ), foul smells or foul-tasting food, the brain being injured, a block in the small intestines so food and liquid cannot go through, too much alcohol or other drugs. Also, people can make themselves vomit (self-induced) which is called purging . Usually people who have eaten or drunk poison are made to vomit any residual (leftover) poison off. Excessive vomiting may lead to dehydration , which can be dangerous, if not fatal as it will shut down a person's organs and twist the intestines.
