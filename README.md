## Scraping Wikipedia
    Originally basing web scrape from https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019 - but yields a lot of duplicate and mismatched pages between EN and Simplified
    Instead, health category gives a broad basing - either to collect parallel data, or to simply gather a lot of English language resources to later be run through a simplifier model.
