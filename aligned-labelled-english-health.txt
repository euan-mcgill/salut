https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health

Health is a state of physical, mental and social well-being in which disease and infirmity are absent. [1]
The meaning of health has evolved over time. In keeping with the biomedical perspective, early definitions of health focused on the theme of the body's ability to function; health was seen as a state of normal function that could be disrupted from time to time by disease . An example of such a definition of health is: "a state characterized by anatomic, physiologic, and psychological integrity; ability to perform personally valued family, work, and community roles; ability to deal with physical , biological , psychological , and social stress ". [2] Then in 1948, in a radical departure from previous definitions, the World Health Organization (WHO) proposed a definition that aimed higher: linking health to well-being , in terms of "physical, mental, and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease and infirmity". [3] Although this definition was welcomed by some as being innovative, it was also criticized as being vague, excessively broad and was not construed as measurable. For a long time, it was set aside as an impractical ideal and most discussions of health returned to the practicality of the biomedical model. [4]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accident
An accident is an unplanned event that sometimes has inconvenient, undesirable or even disastrous consequences, other times being inconsequential. The occurrence of such an event may or may not have unrecognized or unaddressed risks contributing to its cause. Most scientists who study unintentional injury avoid using the term "accident" and focus on factors that increase risk of severe injury and that reduce injury incidence and severity. [1]
Physical examples of accidents include unintended motor vehicle collisions or falls, being injured by touching something sharp, hot, dropping a plate, accidentally kicking the leg of a chair while walking, unintentionally biting one's tongue while eating, accidentally tipping over a glass of water, contacting electricity or ingesting poison. Non-physical examples are unintentionally revealing a secret or otherwise saying something incorrectly, accidental deletion of data, forgetting an appointment etc.
In the process industry, a primary accident may propagate to nearby units, resulting in a chain of accidents, which is called domino effect accident .
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amniocentesis
Amniocentesis (also referred to as an amniotic fluid test or, informally, an " amnio ") is a medical procedure [note 1] used primarily in prenatal diagnosis of chromosomal abnormalities and fetal infections [1] as well as for sex determination . In this procedure, a small amount of amniotic fluid , which contains fetal tissues, is sampled from the amniotic sac surrounding a developing fetus . The fetal DNA is then examined for genetic abnormalities.
The most common reason to have an amniocentesis performed is to determine whether a fetus has certain genetic disorders or a chromosomal abnormality, such as Down syndrome . Amniocentesis (or another procedure, called chorionic villus sampling (CVS)) can diagnose these problems in the womb. [2] These prenatal examinations can prove helpful to expectant guardians, as they allow for evaluating the fetal health status and the feasibility of treatment. [3]
An amniocentesis is performed when a woman is between 15 and 20 weeks gestation. [4] Women who choose to have this test are primarily those at increased risk for genetic and chromosomal problems, in part because the test is invasive and carries a small risk of miscarriage . [4] This process can be used for prenatal sex discernment and hence this procedure has legal restrictions in some countries.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amniotic_sac
The amniotic sac , commonly called the bag of waters , [1] [2] sometimes the membranes , [3] is the sac in which the embryo and later fetus develops in amniotes . It is a thin but tough transparent pair of membranes that hold a developing embryo (and later fetus) until shortly before birth . The inner of these membranes, the amnion , encloses the amniotic cavity , containing the amniotic fluid and the embryo. The outer membrane, the chorion , contains the amnion and is part of the placenta . On the outer side, the amniotic sac is connected to the yolk sac , the allantois , and via the umbilical cord , the placenta . [4]
The yolk sac, amnion, chorion, and allantois are the four extraembryonic membranes that lie outside of the embryo and are involved in providing nutrients and protection to the developing embryo. [5] They form from the inner cell mass ; the first to form is the yolk sac followed by the amnion which grows over the developing embryo. The amnion remains an important extraembryonic membrane throughout prenatal development. The third membrane is the allantios, and the fourth is the chorion which surrounds the embryo after about a month and eventually fuses with the amnion. [6]
Amniocentesis is a medical procedure where fluid from the sac is sampled [7] during fetal development , after 15 weeks of pregnancy, [8] to be used in prenatal diagnosis of chromosomal abnormalities and fetal infections. [9]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant

Antioxidants are compounds that inhibit oxidation , a chemical reaction that can produce free radicals and chain reactions that may damage the cells of organisms. Antioxidants such as thiols or ascorbic acid (vitamin C) may act to inhibit these reactions. To balance oxidative stress , plants and animals maintain complex systems of overlapping antioxidants, such as glutathione .
The only dietary antioxidants are vitamins A , C , and E . The term antioxidant is also used for industrial chemicals added during manufacturing to prevent oxidation in synthetic rubber , plastics , and fuels, or as preservatives in food and cosmetics . [1]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldness

Hair loss , also known as alopecia or baldness , refers to a loss of hair from part of the head or body. [1] Typically at least the head is involved. [3] The severity of hair loss can vary from a small area to the entire body. [6] Inflammation or scarring is not usually present. [3] Hair loss in some people causes psychological distress . [2]
Common types include male- or female-pattern hair loss , alopecia areata , and a thinning of hair known as telogen effluvium . [3] The cause of male-pattern hair loss is a combination of genetics and male hormones ; the cause of female pattern hair loss is unclear; the cause of alopecia areata is autoimmune ; and the cause of telogen effluvium is typically a physically or psychologically stressful event. [3] Telogen effluvium is very common following pregnancy . [3]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benign_paroxysmal_vertigo_of_childhood
Benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood is an uncommon neurological disorder which presents with recurrent episodes of dizziness . [1] The presentation is usually between the ages of 2 years and 7 years of age and is characterised by short episodes of vertigo of sudden onset when the child appears distressed and unwell. The child may cling to something or someone for support. The episode lasts only minutes and resolves suddenly and completely. It is a self-limiting condition and usually resolves after about eighteen months, although many go on to experience migrainous vertigo (or vestibular migraine) when older. [ citation needed ]
Benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood is a migrainous phenomenon with more than 50% of those affected having a family history of migraines affecting a first-degree relative . It has no relationship to benign paroxysmal positional vertigo which is a different condition entirely. [ citation needed ]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bite
Biting is a common behavior involving the opening and closing of the jaw . This behavior is found in reptiles , mammals , fish and amphibians . Arthropods can also bite. Biting can be a physical action in result of an attack, but it is also a normal activity or response in an animal as it eats, carries objects, softens and prepares food for its young, removes ectoparasites from its body surface, removes plant seeds attached to its fur or hair, scratching itself, and grooming other animals. Animal bites often result in serious infections and some times even death. [2] Dog bites are commonplace, with human children the most commonly bitten by dogs and the face being the most commonly bitten target. [3]
The muscle fibers in the jaw are responsible for the opening and closing of the mouth. They initially allow the organism to open their jaw, then contract to bring the teeth together, resulting in the action of a bite. [4] This behavior can have many implications and is exhibited by many different types of organisms, typically dangerous species such as spiders, snakes, and sharks. Biting is one of the main functions in an organism's life, providing the ability to forage, eat, build, play, protect and much more.
The types of teeth that organisms use to bite varies throughout the animal kingdom . Different types of teeth are seen in herbivores , carnivores , and omnivores as they are adapted over many years to better fit their diets. Carnivores possess canine, carnassial , and molar teeth , while herbivores are equipped with incisor teeth and wide-back molars. [5] In general, tooth shape has traditionally been used to predict dieting habits. [6] Carnivores have long, extremely sharp teeth for both gripping prey and cutting meat into chunks. [7] They lack flat chewing teeth because they swallow food in chunks. An example of this is shown by the broad, serrated teeth of great white sharks which prey on large marine animals. [8] On the other hand, herbivores have rows of wide, flat teeth to bite and chew grass and other plants. Cows spend up to eleven hours a day biting off grass and grinding it with their molars. [9] Omnivores consume both meat and plants, so they possess a mixture of flat teeth and sharp teeth.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_donation
A blood donation occurs when a person voluntarily has blood drawn and used for transfusions and/or made into biopharmaceutical medications by a process called fractionation (separation of whole blood components). Donation may be of whole blood, or of specific components directly ( apheresis ). Blood banks often participate in the collection process as well as the procedures that follow it.
Today in the developed world , most blood donors are unpaid volunteers who donate blood for a community supply. In some countries, established supplies are limited and donors usually give blood when family or friends need a transfusion (directed donation).  Many donors donate for several reasons, such as a form of charity, general awareness regarding the demand for blood, increased confidence in oneself, helping a personal friend or relative, and social pressure.  Despite the many reasons that people donate, not enough potential donors actively donate.  However, this is reversed during disasters when blood donations increase, often creating an excess supply that will have to be later discarded.  However, in countries that allow paid donation some people are paid, and in some cases there are incentives other than money such as paid time off from work. People can also have blood drawn for their own future use ( autologous donation ). Donating is relatively safe, but some donors have bruising where the needle is inserted or may feel faint.
Potential donors are evaluated for anything that might make their blood unsafe to use. The screening includes testing for diseases that can be transmitted by a blood transfusion, including HIV and viral hepatitis . The donor must also answer questions about medical history and take a short physical examination to make sure the donation is not hazardous to his or her health. How often a donor can donate varies from days to months based on what component they donate and the laws of the country where the donation takes place. For example, in the United States, donors must wait 56 days (eight weeks) between whole-blood donations but only seven days between platelet apheresis donations [1] and twice per seven-day period in plasmapheresis .
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar

The blood sugar level, blood sugar concentration , or blood glucose level is the measure of concentration of glucose present in the blood of humans or other animals. Approximately 4 grams of glucose, a simple sugar , is present in the blood of a 70 kg (154 lb) human at all times. [2] The body tightly regulates blood glucose levels as a part of metabolic homeostasis . [2] Glucose is stored in skeletal muscle and liver cells in the form of glycogen ; [2] in fasting individuals, blood glucose is maintained at a constant level at the expense of glycogen stores in the liver and skeletal muscle. [2]
In humans, a blood glucose level of 4 grams, or about a teaspoon, is critical for normal function in a number of tissues, and the human brain consumes approximately 60% of blood glucose in fasting, sedentary individuals. [2] A persistent elevation in blood glucose leads to glucose toxicity, which contributes to cell dysfunction and the pathology grouped together as complications of diabetes . [2] Glucose can be transported from the intestines or liver to other tissues in the body via the bloodstream. [2] Cellular glucose uptake is primarily regulated by insulin , a hormone produced in the pancreas . [2]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_modification
Body modification (or body alteration ) is the deliberate altering of the human anatomy or human physical appearance . [1] It is often done for aesthetics, sexual enhancement, rites of passage, religious beliefs , to display group membership or affiliation, in remembrance of lived experience, traditional symbolism such as axis mundi and mythology , to create body art , for shock value , and as self-expression, among other reasons. [1] [2] In its broadest definition it includes skin tattooing, socially acceptable decoration ( e.g. , common ear piercing in many societies), and religious rites of passage (e.g., circumcision in a number of cultures), as well as the modern primitive movement.
Nipple cutting:
Nullification involves the voluntary removal of body parts. Body parts that are commonly removed by those practicing body nullification are: penis , testicles , clitoris , labia and nipples . Sometimes people who desire a nullification may be diagnosed with gender dysphoria , body integrity identity disorder or apotemnophilia . [11]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumcision

Circumcision is the removal of the foreskin from the human penis . [1] [2] In the most common procedure, the foreskin is opened, adhesions are removed, and the foreskin is separated from the glans . After that, a circumcision device may be placed, and then the foreskin is cut off. Topical or locally injected anesthesia is generally used to reduce pain and physiologic stress . [3] The procedure is most often an elective surgery performed on babies and children for religious or cultural reasons. [4] Medically, circumcision is a treatment option for problematic cases of phimosis and balanoposthitis that do not resolve with other treatments, and for chronic urinary tract infections (UTIs). [5] [6] It is contraindicated in cases of certain genital structure abnormalities or poor general health. [1] [6]
The positions of the world's major medical organizations range from a belief that elective circumcision of babies and children carries significant risks and offers no medical benefits to a belief that the procedure has a modest health benefit that outweighs small risks. [7] No major medical organization recommends circumcising all males, and no major medical organization recommends banning the procedure. [7] Ethical and legal questions regarding informed consent and human rights have been raised over the circumcision of babies and children for non-medical reasons; for these reasons, the procedure is controversial . [8] [9]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloth_facemask

A cloth face mask is a mask made of common textiles , usually cotton , worn over the mouth and nose. When more effective masks are not available, and when physical distancing is impossible, cloth face masks are recommended by public health agencies for disease "source control" in epidemic situations to protect others from virus laden droplets in infected mask wearers' breath, coughs, and sneezes. Because they are less effective than N95 masks , surgical masks , or physical distancing in protecting the wearer against viruses, they are not considered to be personal protective equipment by public health agencies. They are used by the general public in household and community settings as protection against both infectious diseases and particulate air pollution .
Cloth face masks were routinely used by healthcare workers starting from the late 19th century until the mid 20th century.  In the 1960s they fell out of use in the developed world in favor of modern surgical masks, but their use has persisted in developing countries .  During the COVID-19 pandemic , their use in developed countries was revived due to shortages of surgical masks and respirators, as well as for environmental concerns and practicality.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjoined_twins
Conjoined twins or Siamese twins are identical twins [1] joined in utero . A very rare phenomenon, the occurrence is estimated to range from 1 in 49,000 births to 1 in 189,000 births, with a somewhat higher incidence in Southwest Asia and Africa. [2] Approximately half are stillborn , and an additional one-third die within 24 hours. Most live births are female, with a ratio of 3:1. [2] [3]
Two contradicting theories exist to explain the origins of conjoined twins. The more generally accepted theory is fission , in which the fertilized egg splits partially. [4] The other theory, no longer believed to be the basis of conjoined twinning, [4] is fusion , in which a fertilized egg completely separates, but stem cells (which search for similar cells) find similar stem cells on the other twin and fuse the twins together. Conjoined twins share a single common chorion , placenta , and amniotic sac , although these characteristics are not exclusive to conjoined twins, as there are some monozygotic but non-conjoined twins who also share these structures in utero . [5]
Chang and Eng Bunker (1811–1874) were brothers born in Siam who traveled widely for many years and were labeled as The Siamese Twins . Chang and Eng were joined at the torso by a band of flesh, cartilage, and their fused livers. In modern times, they could have been easily separated. [6] Due to the brothers' fame and the rarity of the condition, the term "Siamese twins" came to be used as a synonym for conjoined twins.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coprolalia
Coprolalia ( / ˌ k ɒ p r ə ˈ l eɪ l i ə / ) is involuntary swearing or the involuntary utterance of obscene words or socially inappropriate and derogatory remarks. Coprolalia comes from the Greek κόπρος ( kópros ), meaning "dung, feces ", and λαλιά ( laliā́ ) "speech", from λαλεῖν ( laleîn ) "to talk". [1]
Coprolalia is an occasional characteristic of tic disorders , in particular Tourette syndrome , although it is not required for a diagnosis of Tourette's and only about 10% of Tourette's patients exhibit coprolalia. [2] It is not unique to tic disorders; it is also a rare symptom of other neurological disorders.
Coprolalia is one type of coprophenomenon. Other coprophenomena include the related symptoms of copropraxia , involuntary actions such as performing obscene or forbidden gestures, [3] and coprographia , making obscene writings or drawings. [4]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coprophagia
Coprophagia ( / ˌ k ɒ p r ə ˈ f eɪ dʒ i ə / ) [1] or coprophagy ( / k ə ˈ p r ɒ f ə dʒ i / ) is the consumption of feces . The word is derived from the Greek κόπρος copros , "feces" and φαγεῖν phagein , "to eat". Coprophagy refers to many kinds of feces-eating, including eating feces of other species (heterospecifics), of other individuals (allocoprophagy), or one's own (autocoprophagy) – those once deposited or taken directly from the anus . [2]
In humans, coprophagia has been described since the late 19th century in individuals with mental illnesses and in unconventional sexual acts. [3] Some animal species eat feces as a normal behavior, in particular lagomorphs , which do so to allow tough plant materials to be digested more thoroughly by passing twice through the digestive tract. Other species may eat feces under certain conditions .
Centuries ago [ when? ] , physicians tasted their patients' feces, to better judge their state and condition. [4]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detoxification
Detoxification or detoxication ( detox for short) [1] is the physiological or medicinal removal of toxic substances from a living organism , including the human body, which is mainly carried out by the liver. Additionally, it can refer to the period of drug withdrawal during which an organism returns to homeostasis after long-term use of an addictive substance. [2] [3] In medicine , detoxification can be achieved by decontamination of poison ingestion and the use of antidotes as well as techniques such as dialysis and (in a limited number of cases) chelation therapy . [4]
Many alternative medicine practitioners promote various types of detoxification such as detoxification diets . Scientists have described these as a "waste of time and money". [5] [6] Sense About Science , a UK-based charitable trust, determined that most such dietary "detox" claims lack any supporting evidence. [7] [8]
The liver and kidney are naturally capable of detox, as are intracellular (specifically, inner membrane of mitochondria or in the endoplasmic reticulum of cells) proteins such as CYP enyzmes . In cases of kidney failure , the action of the kidneys is mimicked by dialysis ; kidney and liver transplants are also used for kidney and liver failure, respectively.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distress_(medicine)
In medicine, distress is an aversive state in which a person is unable to completely adapt to stressors and their resulting stress and shows maladaptive behaviors. [1] It can be evident in the presence of various phenomena, such as inappropriate social interaction (e.g., aggression, passivity, or withdrawal).
Distress is the opposite of eustress , a positive stress that motivates people.
Stress can be created by influences such as work , school, peers or co-workers, family and death. Other influences vary by age.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Dix

Adrian Dix (born April 20, 1964) [1] is a Canadian politician serving as the current Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) for Vancouver-Kingsway in British Columbia . In addition to serving as the current Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) for Vancouver-Kingsway in British Columbia, Dix is also serving as the current Minister Responsible for Francophone Affairs in British Columbia [2] and the current Minister of Health in British Columbia. He has also served as the leader of the British Columbia New Democratic Party (BC NDP) from 2011 to 2014. [3] He was first elected to the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia in the 2005 provincial election . Dix's decision in 2013 to be replaced as leader came following the party's disappointing result in the May 2013 provincial election which the BC NDP lost despite a 20-point lead in the polls prior to the election campaign. [4]
Adrian Dix was born in Vancouver, to parents Ken and Hilda, immigrants from Ireland and Britain, respectively. His parents ran the Dix Insurance Agency Ltd. on West 41st Avenue in Vancouver until 2011 when his father retired and sold the business. [5] Growing up in Vancouver, Dix was raised as an Anglican and attended both St. George's School and Point Grey Secondary . He then went on to study history and political science at the University of British Columbia . Dix has two siblings and currently lives in Vancouver with his wife Renée Saklikar , a poet and writer. [6] Dix was diagnosed with Type-1 diabetes in his 20s. [5]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyslipidemia
Dyslipidemia is an abnormal amount of lipids (e.g. triglycerides, cholesterol and/or fat phospholipids) in the blood. [1] Dyslipidemia is a risk factor for the development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease ( ASCVD ). [1] ASCVD includes coronary artery disease, cerbrovascular disease, and peripheral artery disease. [1] Although dyslipidemia is a risk factor for ASCVD, abnormal levels doesn't mean that lipid lowering agents need to be started. [2] Other factors, such as comorbid conditions and lifestyle in addition to dyslipidemia, is considered in a cardiovascular risk assessment. [3] In developed countries, most dyslipidemias are hyperlipidemias ; that is, an elevation of lipids in the blood.  This is often due to diet and lifestyle. Prolonged elevation of insulin resistance can also lead to dyslipidemia. [1] Likewise, increased levels of O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) may cause dyslipidemia. [ citation needed ]
Physicians and basic researchers classify dyslipidemias in two distinct ways. One way is its presentation in the body (including the specific type of lipid that is increased). [1] The other way is due to the underlying cause for the condition ( genetic , or secondary to another condition). [1] This classification can be problematic, because most conditions involve the intersection of genetics and lifestyle issues. [1] However, there are a few well-defined genetic conditions that are usually easy to identify. [1]
The three main blood levels collected to assess for dyslipidemia is triglycerides (TG), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). [4] High triglyceride levels (>1.7 mmol/L fasting) can indicate dyslipidemia. [2] Triglycerides are transported through the blood by using very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) as a carrier. [1] One thing to note when measuring triglyceride levels is that fasting for 8-12 hours is required to get an accurate result as non-fasting TG results may be falsely elevated. [4] If TG results are greater than 10 mmol/L, then this needs to be addressed since severe hypertriglceridemia is a risk factor for acute pancreatitis . [2] Another blood level collected to assess dyslipidemia is HDL-C. [4] HDL cholesterol is made up of very little lipids and a high amount of protein. [1] It is beneficial in the body because it functions by going to the tissues and picking up extra cholestrol and fat . [1] Due to the positive effects of HDL-C, it is named "good cholesterol" since it helps prevent plaque formation. [1] Other functions of HDL-C is promoting cardiovascular health such as antioxidation effects, protection against thrombosis , maintenance of endothelial function, and maintaining low blood viscosity. [1] Due to the positive functions of HDL cholesterol, a low level indicates dyslipidemia and is a risk factor for complications. [1] Another diagnostic test that is often reviewed is LDL cholesterol. [4] Low density lipoproteins are made up of cholesterol, TG, phospholipids, and apolipoproteins . [5] LDL-C molecules bind to the endothelium of blood vessels and cause plaque formation. [5] Once plaques are formed, LDL-C floating in the bloodstream can attach to the plaques and cause further accumulation. [5] In addition to plaque formation, LDL-C molecules can undergo oxidation. [1] Oxidation can cause further accumulation of cholesterol and the release of inflammatory cytokines , which damages the blood vessels. [1] [5] Due to the damaging effects of LDL-C, high levels increase the risk for cardiovascular disease and indicate dyslipidemia. [1]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroconvulsive_therapy
Electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT ) is a psychiatric treatment where a generalized seizure (without muscular convulsions ) is electrically induced to manage refractory mental disorders . [1] Typically, 70 to 120 volts are applied externally to the patient's head resulting in approximately 800 milliamperes of direct current passed through the brain, for 100 milliseconds to 6 seconds duration, either from temple to temple (bilateral ECT) or from front to back of one side of the head (unilateral ECT).
The ECT procedure was first conducted in 1938 by Italian psychiatrist Ugo Cerletti [2] and rapidly replaced less safe and effective forms of biological treatments in use at the time. ECT is often used with informed consent [3] as a safe and effective intervention for major depressive disorder , mania , and catatonia . [4] ECT machines were originally placed in the Class III category by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1976. [5] They were re-classified as Class II devices, for treatment of catatonia, major depressive disorder, and bipolar disorder , in 2018. [6]
Aside from effects on the brain, the general physical risks of ECT are similar to those of brief general anesthesia . [7] : 259 Immediately following treatment, the most common adverse effects are confusion and transient memory loss. [4] [8] Among treatments for severely depressed pregnant women, ECT is one of the least harmful to the fetus . [9]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabethan_collar
An Elizabethan collar , E-collar , Buster collar or pet cone (sometimes humorously called a pet lamp-shade , pet radar dish , dog-saver , or cone of shame ) is a protective medical device worn by an animal, usually a cat or dog. Shaped like a truncated cone, its purpose is to prevent the animal from biting or licking at its body or scratching at its head or neck while wounds or injuries heal . [1] The collars are named from the ruffs worn in Elizabethan times .  A U.S. patent was filed by Frank L. Johnson in 1959. [2]
The device is generally attached to the pet's usual collar with strings or tabs passed through holes punched in the sides of the plastic. The neck of the collar should be short enough to let the animal eat and drink. Although most pets adjust to them quite well, others will not eat or drink with the collar in place and the collar is temporarily removed for meals. [3]
While purpose-made collars can be purchased from veterinarians or pet stores, they can also be made from plastic and cardboard or by using plastic flowerpots, wastebaskets, buckets or lampshades. Modern collars might involve soft fabric trim along the edges to increase comfort and velcro surfaces for ease of attachment and removal.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equilibrioception
The sense of balance or equilibrioception is the perception of balance and spatial orientation . [1] It helps prevent humans and nonhuman animals from falling over when standing or moving. Equilibrioception is the result of a number of sensory systems working together: the eyes ( visual system ), the inner ears ( vestibular system ), and the body's sense of where it is in space ( proprioception ) ideally need to be intact. [1]
The vestibular system, the region of the inner ear where three semicircular canals converge, works with the visual system to keep objects in focus when the head is moving. This is called the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) . The balance system works with the visual and skeletal systems (the muscles and joints and their sensors) to maintain orientation or balance. Visual signals sent to the brain about the body's position in relation to its surroundings are processed by the brain and compared to information from the vestibular and skeletal systems.
In the vestibular system, equilibrioception is determined by the level of a fluid called endolymph in the labyrinth , a complex set of tubing in the inner ear .
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eustress
Eustress means beneficial stress —either psychological, physical (e.g. exercise), or biochemical/radiological ( hormesis ).
The term was coined by endocrinologist Hans Selye , consisting of the Greek prefix eu- meaning "good", and stress , literally meaning "good stress".
It is the positive cognitive response to stress that is healthy, or gives one a feeling of fulfillment or other positive feelings. Selye created the term as a subgroup of stress to differentiate the wide variety of stressors and manifestations of stress.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue
Fatigue is a feeling of tiredness. [1] It may be sudden or gradual in onset. It is a normal phenomenon if it follows prolonged physical or mental activity, and resolves completely with rest. However, it may be a symptom of a medical condition if it is prolonged, severe, progressive, or occurs without provocation.
Physical fatigue is the transient inability of muscles to maintain optimal physical performance, and is made more severe by intense physical exercise . [2] [3] [4] Mental fatigue is a transient decrease in maximal cognitive performance resulting from prolonged periods of cognitive activity. Mental fatigue can manifest as somnolence , lethargy , or directed attention fatigue . [5]
Fatigue and 'feelings of fatigue' are sometimes confused. [6] Unlike weakness , fatigue can usually be alleviated by periods of rest .
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female_genital_mutilation


Female genital mutilation ( FGM ), also known as female genital cutting and female circumcision , [a] is the ritual cutting or removal of some or all of the external female genitalia . The practice is found in Africa, Asia and the Middle East, and within communities from countries in which FGM is common. UNICEF estimated in 2016 that 200 million women living today in 30 countries—27 African countries, Indonesia, Iraqi Kurdistan and Yemen—have undergone the procedures. [3]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_aid
First aid is the first and immediate assistance given to any person suffering from either a minor or serious illness or injury , [1] with care provided to preserve life, prevent the condition from worsening, or to promote recovery. It includes initial intervention in a serious condition prior to professional medical help being available, such as performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) while waiting for an ambulance , as well as the complete treatment of minor conditions, such as applying a plaster to a cut . First aid is generally performed by someone with basic medical training. Mental health first aid is an extension of the concept of first aid to cover mental health, [2] while psychological first aid is used as early treatment of people who are at risk for developing PTSD. [3] Conflict First Aid, focused on preservation and recovery of an individual's social or relationship well-being, is being piloted in Canada.
There are many situations that may require first aid, and many countries have legislation, regulation, or guidance which specifies a minimum level of first aid provision in certain circumstances. This can include specific training or equipment to be available in the workplace (such as an automated external defibrillator ), the provision of specialist first aid cover at public gatherings, or mandatory first aid training within schools. First aid, however, does not necessarily require any particular equipment or prior knowledge, and can involve improvisation with materials available at the time, often by untrained people. [4]
First aid can be performed on nearly all animals, such as pets , [5] although this article relates to the care of human patients.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_aid_kit
A first aid kit is a collection of supplies and equipment that is used to give medical treatment. There is a wide variation in the contents of first aid kits based on the knowledge and experience of those putting it together, the differing first aid requirements of the area where it may be used and variations in legislation or regulation in a given area.
The international standard for first aid kits is that they should be identified with the ISO graphical symbol for first aid (from ISO 7010 ) which is an equal white cross on a green background. [1]
First aid kits can be assembled in almost any type of container, and this will depend on whether they are commercially produced or assembled by an individual.  Standard kits often come in durable plastic boxes, fabric pouches or in wall mounted cabinets.  The type of container will vary depending on the purpose, and they range in size from wallet-sized through to a large box.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateway_drug_theory
The gateway drug effect (alternatively, stepping-stone theory , escalation hypothesis , or progression hypothesis ) is a comprehensive catchphrase for the often observed effect that the use of a psychoactive substance is coupled to an increased probability of the use of further substances. Possible causes are biological alterations in the brain due to the earlier substance exposure and similar attitudes of people who use different substances across different substances ( common liability to addiction ). [1] In 2020, the National Institute on Drug Abuse released a study backing allegations that marijuana is a "gateway" to more dangerous substance use, though not for the majority of people who use substances. [2] [3]
The concept of gateway drug is based on observations that the sequence of first-time use of different drugs is not random but shows trends . On the basis of established techniques of longitudinal studies such trends can be described precisely in terms of statistical probability . As to the interpretation of the observed trends, it is important to note the difference between sequence and causation. Both may – but need not – be coupled, a question which is subject of further research, e.g., by physiological experiments. [4]
From a sample of 6,624 people who had not used other illegal drugs before their cannabis consumption the overall probability of later use of other illegal drugs was estimated to be 44.7%. Subgroup analyses showed that personal and social conditions, such as gender, age, marital status, mental disorders, family history of substance use, overlapping illegal drug distribution channels, alcohol use disorder, nicotine dependence, ethnicity , urbanicity , and educational attainment influenced the height of probability. [5] [6]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination
A hallucination is a perception in the absence of external stimulus that has qualities of real perceptions. Hallucinations are vivid, substantial, and are perceived to be located in external objective space. They are distinguishable from several related phenomena , such as dreaming , which does not involve wakefulness; pseudohallucination , which does not mimic real perception, and is accurately perceived as unreal; illusion , which involves distorted or misinterpreted real perception; and imagery (imagination), which does not mimic real perception, and is under voluntary control. [1] Hallucinations also differ from " delusional perceptions", in which a correctly sensed and interpreted stimulus (i.e., a real perception) is given some additional (and typically absurd) significance.
Hallucinations can occur in any sensory modality— visual , auditory , olfactory , gustatory , tactile , proprioceptive , equilibrioceptive , nociceptive , thermoceptive and chronoceptive .
A mild form of hallucination is known as a disturbance , and can occur in most of the senses above. These may be things like seeing movement in peripheral vision , or hearing faint noises or voices. Auditory hallucinations are very common in schizophrenia . They may be benevolent (telling the subject good things about themselves) or malicious, cursing the subject, etc. 55% of auditory hallucinations are malicious in content, [2] for example, people talking about the subject behind their back, etc. Like auditory hallucinations, the source of the visual counterpart can also be behind the subject's back. This can produce a feeling of being looked or stared at, usually with malicious intent. [ citation needed ] Frequently, auditory hallucinations and their visual counterpart are experienced by the subject together. [3] [ citation needed ]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing
Healing is the process of the restoration of health from an unbalanced, diseased, damaged or unvitalized organism.
The profession of nursing has been traditionally concerned with matters of healing, whereas historically the profession of medicine has been concerned with curing. [1]
With physical damage or disease suffered by an organism, healing involves the repair of living tissue(s) , organs and the biological system as a whole and resumption of (normal) functioning. Medicine includes the process by which the cell(s) in the body regenerate and repair to reduce the size of a damaged or necrotic area and replace it with new living tissue. The replacement can happen in two ways: by regeneration in which the necrotic cells are replaced by new cells that form "like" tissue as was originally there; or by repair in which injured tissue is replaced with scar tissue . Most organs will heal using a mixture of both mechanisms.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiccups

A hiccup (also spelled hiccough ) is an involuntary contraction ( myoclonic jerk) of the diaphragm that may repeat several times per minute. The hiccup is an involuntary action involving a reflex arc . [1] Once triggered, the reflex causes a strong contraction of the diaphragm followed about a quarter of a second later by closure of the vocal cords, which results in the "hic" sound.
Hiccups may occur individually, or they may occur in bouts. The rhythm of the hiccup, or the time between hiccups, tends to be relatively constant. A bout of hiccups generally resolves itself without intervention, although many home remedies are often used to attempt to shorten the duration. [2] Medical treatment is occasionally necessary in cases of chronic hiccups.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_microbiome

The human microbiome is the aggregate of all microbiota that reside on or within human tissues and biofluids along with the corresponding anatomical sites in which they reside, [1] including the skin, mammary glands, seminal fluid, uterus, ovarian follicles, lung, saliva, oral mucosa , conjunctiva , biliary tract , and gastrointestinal tract . Types of human microbiota include bacteria , archaea , fungi , protists and viruses . Though micro-animals can also live on the human body, they are typically excluded from this definition. In the context of genomics , the term human microbiome is sometimes used to refer to the collective genomes of resident microorganisms; [2] however, the term human metagenome has the same meaning. [1]
Humans are colonized by many microorganisms, with approximately the same order of magnitude of non-human cells as human cells. [3] Some microorganisms that colonize humans are commensal , meaning they co-exist without harming humans; others have a mutualistic relationship with their human hosts. [2] : 700 [4] Conversely, some non- pathogenic microorganisms can harm human hosts via the metabolites they produce, like trimethylamine , which the human body converts to trimethylamine N-oxide via FMO3 -mediated oxidation. [5] [6] Certain microorganisms perform tasks that are known to be useful to the human host but the role of most of them is not well understood. Those that are expected to be present, and that under normal circumstances do not cause disease, are sometimes deemed normal flora or normal microbiota . [2]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertrophy
Hypertrophy ( / h aɪ ˈ p ɜːr t r ə f i / , from Greek ὑπέρ "excess" + τροφή "nourishment") is the increase in the volume of an organ or tissue due to the enlargement of its component cells . [1] It is distinguished from hyperplasia , in which the cells remain approximately the same size but increase in number. [2] Although hypertrophy and hyperplasia are two distinct processes, they frequently occur together, such as in the case of the hormonally -induced proliferation and enlargement of the cells of the uterus during pregnancy .
Eccentric hypertrophy is a type of hypertrophy where the walls and chamber of a hollow organ undergo growth in which the overall size and volume are enlarged. It is applied especially to the left ventricle of heart. [3] Sarcomeres are added in series, as for example in dilated cardiomyopathy (in contrast to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy , a type of concentric hypertrophy , where sarcomeres are added in parallel).

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_health
International health , also called geographic medicine , international medicine , or global health , is a field of health care, usually with a public health emphasis, dealing with health across regional or national boundaries. One subset of international medicine, travel medicine , prepares travelers with immunizations, prophylactic medications, preventive techniques such as bednets and residual pesticides, in-transit care, and post-travel care for exotic illnesses. International health, however, more often refers to health personnel or organizations from one area or nation providing direct health care, or health sector development, in another area or nation. It is this sense of the term that is explained here. More recently, public health experts have become interested in global processes that impact on human health. Globalization and health , for example, illustrates the complex and changing sociological environment within which the determinants of health and disease express themselves.
The World Health Organization (WHO) is the international body primarily responsible for regulating and governing health-related policies and practices across nations. While the WHO uses various policies and treaties to address international health issues, many of their policies have no binding power and thus state compliance is often limited. As a result, a Framework Convention on Global Health (FCGH) has recently been proposed as a global health treaty that would use stronger domestic accountability mechanisms (including incentives & sanctions) in order to close national and global health inequities. [1] However, some scholars have addressed concerns regarding the FCGH, arguing that it would duplicate other global health governance efforts, lack feasibility, and have limited impact in regulating global health. [2]
Timothy D. Baker was the founder of the first academic department of international health in the United States at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in 1959. [3] [4]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massage

Massage is the manipulation of the body's soft tissues. Massage techniques are commonly applied with hands, fingers, elbows, knees, forearms, feet, or a device. The purpose of massage is generally for the treatment of body stress or pain. A person professionally trained to give massages is traditionally known as a masseur (male) or a masseuse (female) in European countries.  In the United States, these individuals are often referred to as massage therapists because they must be certified and licensed as "Licensed Massage Therapists."
In professional settings, clients are treated while lying on a massage table , sitting in a massage chair , or lying on a mat on the floor. There are many different modalities in the massage industry including but not limited to: Swedish, deep tissue, structural integration, trigger point, manual lymphatic drainage, sports massage, Thai massage, and medical-massage.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_diet

The Mediterranean diet is a diet inspired by the eating habits of Greece, Italy, and Spain in the 1960s. [1] [2] The principal aspects of this diet include proportionally high consumption of olive oil , legumes , unrefined cereals , fruits , [3] and vegetables , moderate to high consumption of fish , moderate consumption of dairy products (mostly as cheese and yogurt ), moderate wine consumption, and low consumption of non-fish meat products. Olive oil has been studied as a potential health factor for reducing all-cause mortality and the risk of chronic diseases .
The Mediterranean diet is associated with a reduction in all-cause mortality in observational studies . [4] There is some evidence that the Mediterranean diet lowers the risk of heart disease and early death, although a 2019 review determined that the evidence had low quality and was uncertain. [5] [6] The American Heart Association and American Diabetes Association recommend the Mediterranean diet as a healthy dietary pattern that may reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes , respectively. [7] [8] [9] The Mediterranean diet may help with weight loss in obese people . [10] The Mediterranean diet is one of three healthy diets recommended in the 2015-2020 US Dietary Guidelines, which also include the DASH diet or a vegetarian diet . [11]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_capacity
Intelligence has been defined in many ways: the capacity for logic , understanding , self-awareness , learning , emotional knowledge , reasoning , planning , creativity , critical thinking , and problem-solving . More generally, it can be described as the ability to perceive or infer information , and to retain it as knowledge to be applied towards adaptive behaviors within an environment or context.
Intelligence is most often studied in humans but has also been observed in both non-human animals and in plants despite controversy as to whether some of these forms of life exhibit intelligence. [1] [2] Intelligence in computers or other machines is called artificial intelligence .
The word intelligence derives from the Latin nouns intelligentia or intellēctus , which in turn stem from the verb intelligere , to comprehend or perceive. In the Middle Ages , the word intellectus became the scholarly technical term for understanding, and a translation for the Greek philosophical term nous . This term, however, was strongly linked to the metaphysical and cosmological theories of teleological scholasticism , including theories of the immortality of the soul, and the concept of the active intellect (also known as the active intelligence). This approach to the study of nature was strongly rejected by the early modern philosophers such as Francis Bacon , Thomas Hobbes , John Locke , and David Hume , all of whom preferred "understanding" (in place of " intellectus " or "intelligence") in their English philosophical works. [3] [4] Hobbes for example, in his Latin De Corpore , used " intellectus intelligit ", translated in the English version as "the understanding understandeth", as a typical example of a logical absurdity . [5] "Intelligence" has therefore become less common in English language philosophy, but it has later been taken up (with the scholastic theories which it now implies) in more contemporary psychology . [6]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muteness
Muteness or mutism (from Latin mutus 'silent') is defined as an absence of speech while conserving or maintaining the ability to hear the speech of others. [1] Mutism is typically understood as an inability to speak on the part of a child or an adult due to an observed lack of speech from the point of view of others who know them. Such observers commonly include a mute person's family members, caregivers, teachers, and health professionals like doctors or speech and language pathologists .  Muteness may not be a permanent condition, depending upon etiology (cause).  In general, someone who is mute may be mute for one of several different reasons: organic, psychological , developmental / neurological trauma . [2] For children, a lack of speech may be developmental, neurological, psychological, or due to a physical disability or a communication disorder . For adults who previously had speech and then became unable to speak, loss of speech may be due to injury, disease, termed aphasia , or surgery affecting areas of the brain needed for speech. Loss of speech in adults may occur rarely for psychological reasons.
Treatment or management of muteness depends on what has caused the absence of speech. When there is an absence of speech, a speech assessment is strongly recommended to determine cause and treatment. [3] Treatment of absence of speech is possible in a variety of cases. If the absence of speech is determined to be a permanent condition, a range of assistive and augmentative communication devices are available to aid communication.
Organic causes of mutism may stem from several different sources. One cause of muteness may be problems with the physiology involved in speech, for example, the mouth or tongue. [4] Mutism may be due to apraxia , that is, problems with coordination of muscles involved in speech. [5] Another cause may be a medical condition impacting the physical structures involved in speech, for example, loss of voice due to the injury, paralysis, or illness of the larynx . [6] Anarthria is a severe form of dysarthria . The coordination of movements of the mouth and tongue or the conscious coordination of the lungs are damaged. [7]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutilation
Mutilation or maiming (from the Latin: mutilus ) is cutting off or causing injury to a body part of a person so that the part of the body is permanently damaged, detached or disfigured. [1]
In 2019, Dr. Michael H. Stone , Dr. Gary Brucato and Dr. Ann Burgess proposed formal criteria by which “mutilation” might be systematically distinguished from the act of “ dismemberment ,” as these terms are commonly used interchangeably. They suggested that dismemberment involves “the entire removal, by any means, of a large section of the body of a living or dead person, specifically, the head (also termed decapitation), arms, hands, torso, pelvic area, legs, or feet.” Mutilation, by contrast, involves “the removal or irreparable disfigurement, by any means, of some smaller portion of one of those larger sections of a living or dead person. The latter would include castration (removal of the testicles ), evisceration (removal of the internal organs ), and flaying (removal of the skin ).” According to these parameters, removing a whole hand would constitute dismemberment, while removing or damaging a finger would be mutilation; decapitation of a full head would be dismemberment, while removing or damaging a part of the face would be mutilation; and removing a whole torso would be dismemberment, while removing or damaging a breast or the organs contained within the torso would be mutilation. [2]
Some ethnic groups practice ritual mutilation, e.g. scarification , burning , flagellation , tattooing , or wheeling , as part of a rite of passage . In some cases, the term may apply to treatment of dead bodies, such as soldiers mutilated after they have been killed by an enemy.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebulizer
In medicine , a nebulizer ( American English ) [1] or nebuliser ( British English ) [2] is a drug delivery device used to administer medication in the form of a mist inhaled into the lungs. Nebulizers are commonly used for the treatment of asthma , cystic fibrosis , COPD and other respiratory diseases or disorders. They use oxygen , compressed air or ultrasonic power to break up solutions and suspensions into small aerosol droplets that are inhaled from the mouthpiece of the device. An aerosol is a mixture of gas and solid or liquid particles.
Various asthma guidelines, such as the Global Initiative for Asthma Guidelines [GINA], the British Guidelines on the management of Asthma, The Canadian Pediatric Asthma Consensus Guidelines, and United States Guidelines for Diagnosis and Treatment of Asthma each recommend metered dose inhalers in place of nebulizer-delivered therapies. [3] The European Respiratory Society acknowledge that although nebulizers are used in hospitals and at home they suggest much of this use may not be evidence-based. [4]
Recent evidence shows that nebulizers are no more effective than metered-dose inhalers (MDIs) with spacers. [5] An MDI with a spacer may offer advantages to children who have acute asthma. [3] [6] [5] Those findings refer specifically to the treatment of asthma and not to the efficacy of nebulisers generally, as for COPD for example. [5] For COPD, especially when assessing exacerbations or lung attacks, there is no evidence to indicate that MDI (with a spacer) delivered medicine is more effective than administration of the same medicine with a nebulizer. [7]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocturnal_enuresis
Nocturnal enuresis , also called bedwetting , is involuntary urination while asleep after the age at which bladder control usually begins. Bedwetting in children and adults can result in emotional stress. [1] Complications can include urinary tract infections . [1]
Most bedwetting is a developmental delay —not an emotional problem or physical illness. Only a small percentage (5 to 10%) of bedwetting cases have a specific medical cause. [2] Bedwetting is commonly associated with a family history of the condition. [3] Nocturnal enuresis is considered primary when a child has not yet had a prolonged period of being dry. Secondary nocturnal enuresis is when a child or adult begins wetting again after having stayed dry.
Treatments range from behavioral therapy , such as bedwetting alarms , to medication, such as hormone replacement , and even surgery such as urethral dilatation . Since most bedwetting is simply a developmental delay, most treatment plans aim to protect or improve self-esteem . [2] Treatment guidelines recommend that the physician counsel the parents, [4] warning about psychological consequences caused by pressure, shaming, or punishment for a condition children cannot control. [2]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_Safety_and_Health
Occupational safety and health ( OSH ), also commonly referred to as occupational health and safety ( OHS ), occupational health , [1] or occupational safety , is a multidisciplinary field concerned with the safety , health , and welfare of people at occupation . These terms also refer to the goals of this field, [2] so their use in the sense of this article was originally an abbreviation of occupational safety and health program/department etc.
The goal of an occupational safety and health program is to foster a safe and healthy occupational environment. [3] OSH also protects all the general public who may be affected by the occupational environment. [4]
In common-law jurisdictions, employers have a common law duty, (also called duty of care) to take reasonable care of the safety of their employees. [5] Statute law may, in addition, impose other general duties, introduce specific duties, and create government bodies with powers to regulate occupational safety issues: details of this vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega-3_fatty_acid
Omega−3 fatty acids , also called Omega-3 oils , ω−3 fatty acids or n −3 fatty acids , [1] are polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) characterized by the presence of a double bond, three atoms away from the terminal methyl group in their chemical structure.  They are widely distributed in nature, being important constituents of animal lipid metabolism , and they play an important role in the human diet and in human physiology. [2] [3] The three types of omega−3 fatty acids involved in human physiology are α-linolenic acid (ALA) , found in plant oils, and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), both commonly found in marine oils. [2] Marine algae and phytoplankton are primary sources of omega−3 fatty acids (which also accumulate in fish). Common sources of plant oils containing ALA include walnut , edible seeds, clary sage seed oil, algal oil , flaxseed oil , Sacha Inchi oil, Echium oil, and hemp oil , while sources of animal omega−3 fatty acids EPA and DHA include fish, fish oils , eggs from chickens, squid oils and krill oil .
Mammals are unable to synthesize the essential omega−3 fatty acid ALA and can only obtain it through diet. However, they can use ALA, when available, to form EPA and DHA, by creating additional double bonds along its carbon chain ( desaturation ) and extending it ( elongation ). Namely, ALA (18 carbons and 3 double bonds) is used to make EPA (20 carbons and 5 double bonds), which is then used to make DHA (22 carbons and 6 double bonds). [4] The ability to make the longer-chain omega−3 fatty acids from ALA may be impaired in aging. [5] In foods exposed to air, unsaturated fatty acids are vulnerable to oxidation and rancidity . [6]
Dietary supplementation with omega−3 fatty acids does not appear to affect the risk of death, cancer or heart disease . [7] Furthermore, fish oil supplement studies have failed to support claims of preventing heart attacks or strokes or any vascular disease outcomes. [8] [9]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega-6_fatty_acid
Omega-6 fatty acids (also referred to as ω-6 fatty acids or n -6 fatty acids ) are a family of polyunsaturated fatty acids that have in common a final carbon-carbon double bond in the n -6 position, that is, the sixth bond, counting from the methyl end. [1]
Linoleic acid (18:2, n −6), the shortest-chain of the common omega-6 fatty acids in the human diet, is categorized as an essential fatty acid because the human body cannot synthesize it. Omega-6 fatty acids are precursors to endocannabinoids , lipoxins , and specific eicosanoids .
Mammalian cells lack the enzyme omega-3 desaturase and therefore cannot convert omega-6 fatty acids to omega-3 fatty acids, which is why certain omega-3 fatty acids are also essential.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteopathy

Osteopathy is a type of alternative medicine that emphasizes physical manipulation of the body's muscle tissue and bones . [1] [2] Practitioners of osteopathy are referred to as osteopaths. [3] [4] [5] Its name derives from Ancient Greek "bone" ( ὀστέον ) and "sensitive to" or "responding to" ( -πάθεια ). [6] [7] [8]
Osteopathic manipulation is the core set of techniques in osteopathy. [9] Parts of osteopathy, such as craniosacral therapy , have no therapeutic value and have been labeled as pseudoscience and quackery . [10] [11] The techniques are based on an ideology created by Andrew Taylor Still (1828–1917) which posits the existence of a " myofascial continuity"—a tissue layer that "links every part of the body with every other part". Osteopaths attempt to diagnose and treat what was originally called "the osteopathic lesion", but which is now named "somatic dysfunction", [9] by manipulating a person's bones and muscles. Osteopathic Manipulative Treatment (OMT) techniques are most commonly used to treat back pain and other musculoskeletal issues. [9] [12]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poison
In biology , poisons are substances that can cause death , injury or harm to organs , tissues , cells , and DNA usually by chemical reactions or other activity on the molecular scales, when an organism is exposed to a sufficient quantity. [1] [2]
The fields of medicine (particularly veterinary) and zoology often distinguish a poison from a toxin , and from a venom . Toxins are poisons produced by organisms in nature, and venoms are toxins injected by a bite or sting (this is exclusive to animals). The difference between venom and other poisons is the delivery method.
Industry , agriculture , and other sectors employ poisonous substances for reasons other than their toxicity . Most poisonous industrial compounds have associated material safety data sheets and are classed as hazardous substances . Hazardous substances are subject to extensive regulation on production, procurement and use in overlapping domains of occupational safety and health , public health , drinking water quality standards , air pollution and environmental protection . Due to the mechanics of molecular diffusion , many poisonous compounds rapidly diffuse into biological tissues, air, water, or soil on a molecular scale. By the principle of entropy , chemical contamination is typically costly or infeasible to reverse, unless specific chelating agents or micro-filtration processes are available. Chelating agents are often broader in scope than the acute target, and therefore their ingestion necessitates careful medical or veterinarian supervision.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_food
Raw foodism , also known as rawism or following a raw food diet , is the dietary practice of eating only or mostly food that is uncooked and unprocessed . Depending on the philosophy, or type of lifestyle and results desired, raw food diets may include a selection of fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, eggs, fish, meat, and dairy products. The diet may also include simply processed foods, such as various types of sprouted seeds , cheese , and fermented foods such as yogurts , kefir , kombucha , or sauerkraut , but generally not foods that have been pasteurized , homogenized , or produced with the use of synthetic pesticides , fertilizers , solvents , and food additives .
The British Dietetic Association has described raw foodism as a fad diet . [1] [2] Raw food diets, specifically raw veganism, may diminish intake of essential minerals and nutrients, such as vitamin B 12 . [1] [3] [4] Claims held by raw food proponents are pseudoscientific . [5] : 44
Raw food diets are diets composed entirely or mostly of food that is uncooked or that is cooked at low temperatures. [3] [4] [6]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ritual_purification

Ritual purification is the ritual prescribed by a religion by which a person is considered to be free of uncleanliness , especially prior to the worship of a deity , and ritual purity is a state of ritual cleanliness . Ritual purification may also apply to objects and places. Ritual uncleanliness is not identical with ordinary physical impurity, such as dirt stains; nevertheless, body fluids are generally considered ritually unclean.
Most of these rituals existed long before the germ theory of disease , and figure prominently from the earliest known religious systems of the Ancient Near East . Some writers connect the rituals to taboos .
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_vaccine

A ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) vaccine or messenger RNA ( mRNA ) vaccine is a type of vaccine that uses a copy of a natural chemical called messenger RNA (mRNA) to produce an immune response. [1] The vaccine transfects molecules of synthetic RNA into immunity cells . Once inside the immune cells, the vaccine's RNA functions as mRNA, causing the cells to build the foreign protein that would normally be produced by a pathogen (such as a virus) or by a cancer cell. These protein molecules stimulate an adaptive immune response which teaches the body how to identify and destroy the corresponding pathogen or cancer cells. [1] The delivery of mRNA is achieved by a co-formulation of the molecule into lipid nanoparticles which protect the RNA strands and helps their absorption into the cells. [2] [3]
Reactogenicity , the property of a vaccine of being able to produce common, expected adverse reactions, is similar to that of conventional non-RNA vaccines. [4] People susceptible to an autoimmune response may have an adverse reaction to RNA vaccines. [4] The advantages of RNA vaccines over traditional protein vaccines are superior design and production speed, lower cost of production, [5] [4] and the induction of both cellular as well as humoral immunity . [6] A disadvantage in the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine for COVID-19 is that it requires ultracold storage before distribution. [1]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturated_fat
A saturated fat is a type of fat in which the fatty acid chains have all or predominantly single bonds .  A fat is made of two kinds of smaller molecules: glycerol and fatty acids . Fats are made of long chains of carbon (C) atoms. Some carbon atoms are linked by single bonds (-C-C-) and others are linked by double bonds (-C=C-). [1] Double bonds can react with hydrogen to form single bonds. They are called saturated because the second bond is broken and each half of the bond is attached to (saturated with) a hydrogen atom.
Saturated fats tend to have higher melting points than their corresponding unsaturated fats, leading to the popular understanding that saturated fats tend to be solids at room temperatures, while unsaturated fats tend to be liquid at room temperature with varying degrees of viscosity.
Most animal fats are saturated. The fats of plants and fish are generally unsaturated. [1] Various foods contain different proportions of saturated and unsaturated fat . Many processed foods like foods deep-fried in hydrogenated oil and sausage are high in saturated fat content. Some store-bought baked goods are as well, especially those containing partially hydrogenated oils . [2] [3] [4] Other examples of foods containing a high proportion of saturated fat and dietary cholesterol include animal fat products such as lard or schmaltz , fatty meats and dairy products made with whole or reduced fat milk like yogurt , ice cream , cheese and butter . [5] Certain vegetable products have high saturated fat content, such as coconut oil and palm kernel oil . [6]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauna

A sauna ( / ˈ s ɔː n ə , s aʊ -/ ; [1] [2] Finnish pronunciation: [ˈsɑunɑ] ), or sudatory , is a small room or building designed as a place to experience dry or wet heat sessions, or an establishment with one or more of these facilities. The steam and high heat make the bathers perspire. Infrared therapy is often referred to as a type of sauna, but according to the Finnish sauna organisations, infrared is not a sauna. [3]
Tampere , the third-largest city of Finland , has been officially declared the "Sauna Capital of the World". [4] [5] [6] [7] [8]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_and_rescue
Search and rescue ( SAR ) is the search for and provision of aid to people who are in distress or imminent danger. The general field of search and rescue includes many specialty sub-fields, typically determined by the type of terrain the search is conducted over. These include mountain rescue ; ground search and rescue, including the use of search and rescue dogs ; urban search and rescue in cities; combat search and rescue on the battlefield and air-sea rescue over water.
International Search and Rescue Advisory Group (INSARAG) is a UN organization that promotes the exchange of information between national urban search and rescue organizations. The duty to render assistance is covered by Article 98 of the UNCLOS .
There are many different definitions of search and rescue, depending on the agency involved and country in question.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)

Stress , either physiological , biological , or psychological is an organism's response to a stressor such as an environmental condition. [1] Stress is the body's method of reacting to a condition such as a threat, challenge or physical and psychological barrier. Stimuli that alter an organism's environment are responded to by multiple systems in the body. [2] In humans and most mammals, the autonomic nervous system and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis are the two major systems that respond to stress. [3]
The sympathoadrenal medullary (SAM) axis may activate the fight-or-flight response through the sympathetic nervous system , which dedicates energy to more relevant bodily systems to acute adaptation to stress, while the parasympathetic nervous system returns the body to homeostasis. The second major physiological stress-response center, the HPA axis, regulates the release of cortisol , which influences many bodily functions such as metabolic, psychological and immunological functions . The SAM and HPA axes are regulated by several brain regions, including the limbic system , prefrontal cortex , amygdala , hypothalamus , and stria terminalis . [3]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_management
Stress management is a wide spectrum of techniques and psychotherapies aimed at controlling a person's level of stress , especially chronic stress , usually for the purpose of and for the motive of improving everyday functioning. Stress produces numerous physical and mental symptoms which vary according to each individual's situational factors. These can include physical health decline as well as depression . The process of stress management is named as one of the keys to a happy and successful life in modern society. Although life provides numerous demands that can prove difficult to handle, stress management provides a number of ways to manage anxiety and maintain overall well-being.
Despite stress often being thought of as a subjective experience, levels of stress are readily measurable, using various physiological tests, similar to those used in polygraphs .
Evaluating the effectiveness of various stress management techniques can be difficult, as limited research currently exists. Consequently, the amount and quality of evidence for the various techniques varies widely. Some are accepted as effective treatments for use in psychotherapy, while others with less evidence favoring them are considered alternative therapies .  Many professional organizations exist to promote and provide training in conventional or alternative therapies.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_mask
A surgical mask , also known as a medical face mask , is a personal protective equipment worn by health professionals during medical procedures . [1] [2] It prevents airborne transmission of infections between patients and/or treating personnel by blocking the movement of pathogens (primarily bacteria and viruses ) shed in respiratory droplets and aerosols into and from the wearer's mouth and nose . [3] [4] [5]
Typically quite impermeable to moisture, the mask act as an additional barrier for the airway and are not usually designed (unless N95-rated ) to completely prevent the wearer from inhaling smaller airborne pathogens, but could be still protective by filtering out and trapping most of the droplets that carry them. [6] There is a predominance of evidence that surgical masks protect both the wearer (by filtering the inhaled air) and bystanders (by blocking down forceful exhalations from the wearer that can spread pathogens afar). [7]
Surgical masks were originally designed to protect medical personnel from accidentally breathing or swallowing in splashes or sprays of bodily fluids , but the effectiveness of surgical masks against influenza -like infections has not been confirmed by high-quality randomized controlled trials . [8] Commonly seen surgical masks vary greatly by quality and levels of protection. Despite their name, not all surgical masks are appropriate to be used during surgery. Surgical masks may be labeled as surgical, isolation, dental or medical procedure masks. [9] Chinese health officials distinguish between medical (non-surgical) and surgical masks. [10]

Taqwīm as‑Siḥḥa ( تقويم الصحة Maintenance of Health ) is originally an eleventh-century Arab medical treatise by Ibn Butlan of Baghdad . [1] In the West, the work is known by the Latinized name taken by its translations: Tacuinum (sometimes Taccuinum ) Sanitatis . [2] It is a medieval handbook mainly on health , aimed at a cultured lay audience, the text exists in several variant Latin versions, the manuscripts of which are characteristically so profusely illustrated that one student called the Tacuinum "a [300] picture book", only "nominally a medical text". [3]
Though describing in detail the beneficial and harmful properties of foods and plants, it is far more than a herbal . Listing its contents organically rather than alphabetically, it sets forth the six essential elements for well-being:
Tacuinum Sanitatis says that illnesses result from imbalance of these elements.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirst
Thirst is the craving for potable fluids, resulting in the basic instinct of animals to drink . It is an essential mechanism involved in fluid balance . [1] It arises from a lack of fluids or an increase in the concentration of certain osmolites , such as sodium . If the water volume of the body falls below a certain threshold or the osmolite concentration becomes too high, structures in the brain detect changes in blood constituents and signal thirst. [2]
Continuous dehydration can cause acute and chronic diseases, but is most often associated with renal and neurological disorders. [1] Excessive thirst, called polydipsia , along with excessive urination, known as polyuria , may be an indication of diabetes mellitus or diabetes insipidus .
There are receptors and other systems in the body that detect a decreased volume or an increased osmolite concentration. [1] [2] Some sources distinguish "extracellular thirst" from "intracellular thirst", where extracellular thirst is thirst generated by decreased volume and intracellular thirst is thirst generated by increased osmolite concentration.

Veterinary medicine is the branch of medicine that deals with the prevention, control, diagnosis, and treatment of disease, disorder, and injury in animals . Along with this, it deals with animal rearing, husbandry, breeding, research on nutrition, and product development. The scope of veterinary medicine is wide, covering all animal species, both domesticated and wild , with a wide range of conditions that can affect different species.
Veterinary medicine is widely practiced, both with and without professional supervision. Professional care is most often led by a veterinary physician (also known as a veterinarian, veterinary surgeon, or "vet"), but also by paraveterinary workers , such as veterinary nurses or technicians.  This can be augmented by other paraprofessionals with specific specialties, such as animal physiotherapy or dentistry , and species-relevant roles such as farriers .
Veterinary science helps human health through the monitoring and control of zoonotic disease ( infectious disease transmitted from nonhuman animals to humans), food safety, and indirectly through human applications from basic medical research. They also help to maintain food supply through livestock health monitoring and treatment, and mental health by keeping pets healthy and long-living. Veterinary scientists often collaborate with epidemiologists and other health or natural scientists, depending on type of work. Ethically, veterinarians are usually obliged to look after animal welfare. Veterinarians diagnose, treat, and help keep animals safe and healthy.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ViSalus
Vi (formerly ViSalus Sciences) [2] is an American multilevel marketing (MLM) company based in Los Angeles , California , with offices in Downtown Detroit , Michigan . [3] · The company is mostly known for the Body by Vi 90-Day Challenge platform. The company markets weight management nutritional products, dietary supplements and energy drinks in the United States, Canada, Italy and United Kingdom. [4] [5] Weight management products, including Vi-Shape meal replacement shake and Vi-Trim Clear Control Drink Mix, form the bulk of the company's sales. [6]
Vi was originally started in 1997 by Nick Sarnicola and Blake Mallen, two distributors with The Free Network, LLC, a telecommunications MLM company based in Troy, Michigan . [3] After The Free Network folded in March 2005, Vi was purchased by wireless Internet developer Ryan Blair with investment from Ropart Asset Management, a private equity firm owned by Robert B. Goergen . Sarnicola and Mallen were retained as sales chief and CMO , respectively. The company was moved to the San Francisco Bay Area. [7]
The 2008 recession put Vi near bankruptcy, with the business $6 million in debt. [8] In 2008, Vi was acquired by Blyth, Inc. , a multi-level marketing company that sells home decor which had been founded by Georgen. [7] In the first stage of the takeover – completed in 2008 – Blyth purchased a 43.6% equity interest for $14.0 million. [6] [9] By 2010 the company had returned to profitability, and Vi was making over $15 million a month. [10] Blyth  completed the second phase of the takeover in 2011, investing an additional $2.5 million and increasing their ownership share to 57.5%. [11]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_loss

Weight loss , in the context of medicine, health, or physical fitness , refers to a reduction of the total body mass , by a mean loss of fluid, body fat ( adipose tissue ), or lean mass (namely bone mineral deposits, muscle, tendon, and other connective tissue). Weight loss can either occur unintentionally because of malnourishment or an underlying disease, or from a conscious effort to improve an actual or perceived overweight or obese state.  "Unexplained" weight loss that is not caused by reduction in calorific intake or exercise is called cachexia and may be a symptom of a serious medical condition . Intentional weight loss is commonly referred to as slimming .
Intentional weight loss is the loss of total body mass as a result of efforts to improve fitness and health, or to change appearance through slimming. Weight loss is the main treatment for obesity , [1] [2] [3] and there is substantial evidence this can prevent progression from prediabetes to type 2 diabetes with a 7-10% weight loss and manage cardiometabolic health for diabetic people with a 5-15% weight loss. [4]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yo-yo_effect
Yo-yo dieting or yo-yo effect , also known as weight cycling , is a term coined by Kelly D. Brownell at Yale University , in reference to the cyclical loss and gain of weight, resembling the up-down motion of a yo-yo . In this process, the dieter is initially successful in the pursuit of weight loss but is unsuccessful in maintaining the loss long-term and begins to gain the weight back. The dieter then seeks to lose the regained weight, and the cycle begins again.
The reasons for yo-yo dieting are varied but often include embarking upon a hypocaloric diet that was initially too extreme. At first the dieter may experience elation at the thought of weight loss and pride in their rejection of food. Over time, however, the limits imposed by such extreme diets cause effects such as depression or fatigue that make the diet impossible to sustain. Ultimately, the dieter reverts to their old eating habits , now with the added emotional effects of failing to lose weight by restrictive diet. Such an emotional state leads many people to eating more than they would have before dieting, causing them to rapidly regain weight. [1]
The process of regaining weight and especially body fat is further promoted by the high metabolic plasticity of skeletal muscle. The Summermatter cycle [2] explains how skeletal muscle persistently reduces energy expenditure during dieting. In addition, food restriction increases physical activity which further supports body weight loss initially. Such weight regain in the form of preferential catch-up-fat is well documented after weight loss due to malnutrition, cancer, septic shock or AIDS and thus constitutes a general phenomenon related to weight loss.
